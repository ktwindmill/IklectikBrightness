 the present volume may be considered as one of the consequences that have resulted from the calculating engine the construction of which i have been so long superintending having been induced during the last ten years to visit a considerable number of workshops and factories both in england and on the continent for the purpose of endeavouring to make myself acquainted with the various resources of mechanical art i was insensibly led to apply to them those principles of generalization to which my other pursuits had naturally given rise the increased number of curious processes and interesting facts which thus came under my attention as well as of the reflections which they suggested induced me to believe that the publication of some of them might be of use to persons who propose to bestow their attention on those enquiries which i have only incidentally considered with this view it was my intention to have delivered the present work in the form of a course of lectures at cambridge; an intention which i was subsequently induced to alter the substance of a considerable portion of it has however appeared among the preliminary chapters of the mechanical part of the encyclopedia metropolitana i have not attempted to offer a complete enumeration of all the mechanical principles which regulate the application of machinery to arts and manufactures but i have endeavoured to present to the reader those which struck me as the most important either for understanding the actions of machines or for enabling the memory to classify and arrange the facts connected with their employment still less have i attempted to examine all the difficult questions of political economy which are intimately connected with such enquiries it was impossible not to trace or to imagine among the wide variety of facts presented to me some principles which seemed to pervade many establishments; and having formed such conjectures the desire to refute or to verify them gave an additional interest to the pursuit several of the principles which i have proposed appear to me to have been unnoticed before this was particularly the case with respect to the explanation i have given of the division of labour; but further enquiry satisfied me that i had been anticipated by m gioja and it is probable that additional research would enable me to trace most of the other principles which i had thought original to previous writers to whose merit i may perhaps be unjust from my want of acquaintance with the historical branch of the subject the truth however of the principles i have stated is of much more importance than their origin; and the utility of an enquiry into them and of establishing others more correct if these should be erroneous can scarcely admit of a doubt the difficulty of understanding the processes of manufactures has unfortunately been greatly overrated to examine them with the eye of a manufacturer so as to be able to direct others to repeat them does undoubtedly require much skill and previous acquaintance with the subject; but merely to apprehend their general principles and mutual relations is within the power of almost every person possessing a tolerable education those who possess rank in a manufacturing country can scarcely be excused if they are entirely ignorant of principles whose development has produced its greatness the possessors of wealth can scarcely be indifferent to processes which nearly or remotely have been the fertile source of their possessions those who enjoy leisure can scarcely find a more interesting and instructive pursuit than the examination of the workshops of their own country which contain within them a rich mine of knowledge too generally neglected by the wealthier classes it has been my endeavour as much as possible to avoid all technical terms and to describe in concise language the arts i have had occasion to discuss in touching on the more abstract principles of political economy after shortly stating the reasons on which they are founded i have endeavoured to support them by facts and anecdotes; so that whilst young persons might be amused and instructed by the illustrations those of more advanced judgement may find subject for meditation in the general conclusions to which they point i was anxious to support the principles which i have advocated by the observations of others and in this respect i found myself peculiarly fortunate the reports of committees of the house of commons upon various branches of commerce and manufactures and the evidence which they have at different periods published on those subjects teem with information of the most important kind rendered doubly valuable by the circumstances under which it has been collected from these sources i have freely taken and i have derived some additional confidence from the support they have afforded to my views * charles babbage dorset street manchester square june  *footnote i am happy to avail myself of this occasion of expressing my obligations to the right hon manners sutton the speaker of the house of commons to whom i am indebted for copies of a considerable collection of those reports  preface to the second edition  in two months from the publication of the first edition of this volume three thousand copies were in the hands of the public very little was spent in advertisements; the booksellers instead of aiding impeded its sale; * it formed no part of any popular series and yet the public in a few weeks purchased the whole edition some small part of this success perhaps was due to the popular exposition of those curious processes which are carried on in our workshops and to the endeavour to take a short view of the general principles which direct the manufactories of the country but the chief reason was the commanding attraction of the subject and the increasing desire to become acquainted with the pursuits and interests of that portion of the people which has recently acquired so large an accession of political influence  *footnote i had good evidence of this fact from various quarters; and being desirous of verifying it i myself applied for a copy at the shop of a bookseller of respectability who is probably not aware that he refused to procure one even for its author  a greater degree of attention than i had expected has been excited by what i have stated in the first edition respecting the 'booktrade' until i had commenced the chapter 'on the separate cost of each process of a manufacture' i had no intention of alluding to that subject but the reader will perceive that i have throughout this volume wherever i could employed as illustrations objects of easy access to the reader; and in accordance with that principle i selected the volume itself when i arrived at the chapter 'on combinations of masters against the public' i was induced for the same reason to expose a combination connected with literature which in my opinion is both morally and politically wrong i entered upon this enquiry without the slightest feeling of hostility to that trade nor have i any wish unfavourable to it; but i think a complete reform in its system would add to its usefulness and respectability as the subject of that chapter has been much discussed i have thought it right to take a view of the various arguments which have been advanced and to offer my own opinion respecting their validityand there i should have left the subject content to allow my general character to plead for me against insinuations respecting my motivesbut as the remarks of some of my critics affect the character of another person i think it but just to state circumstances which will clearly disprove them mr fellowes of ludgate street who had previously been the publisher of some other volumes for me had undertaken the publication of the first edition of the present work a short time previous to its completion i thought it right to call his attention to the chapter in which the booktrade is discussed; with the view both of making him acquainted with what i had stated and also of availing myself of his knowledge in correcting any accidental error as to the facts mr fellowes 'differing from me entirely respecting the conclusions i had arrived at' then declined the publication of the volume if i had then chosen to apply to some of those other booksellers whose names appear in the committee of 'the trade' it is probable that they also would have declined the office of publishing for me; and had my object been to make a case against the trade such a course would have assisted me but i had no such feeling; and having procured a complete copy of the whole work i called with it on mr knight of pall mall east whom until that day i had never seen and with whom i had never previously had the slightest communication i left the book in mr knight's hands with a request that when he had read it i might be informed whether he would undertake the publication of it; and this he consented to do mr knight therefore is so far from being responsible for a single opinion in the present volume that he saw it only for a short time a few days previous to its publication it has been objected to me that i have exposed too freely the secrets of trade the only real secrets of trade are industry integrity and knowledge to the possessors of these no exposure can be injurious; and they never fail to produce respect and wealth the alterations in the present edition are so frequent that i found it impossible to comprise them in a supplement but the three new chapters 'on money as a medium of exchange'; 'on a new system of manufacturing'; and 'on the effect of machinery in reducing the demand for labour'; will shortly be printed separately for the use of the purchasers of the first edition i am inclined to attach some importance to the new system of manufacturing; and venture to throw it out with the hope of its receiving a full discussion among those who are most interested in the subject i believe that some such system of conducting manufactories would greatly increase the productive powers of any country adopting it; and that our own possesses much greater facilities for its application than other countries in the greater intelligence and superior education of the working classes the system would naturally commence in some large town by the union of some of the most prudent and active workmen; and their example if successful would be followed by others the small capitalist would next join them and such factories would go on increasing until competition compelled the large capitalist to adopt the same system; and ultimately the whole faculties of every man engaged in manufacture would be concentrated upon one objectthe art of producing a good article at the lowest possible costwhilst the moral effect on that class of the population would be useful in the highest degree since it would render character of far greater value to the workman than it is at present to one criticism which has been made this volume is perfectly open i have dismissed the important subject of the patentlaws in a few lines the subject presents in my opinion great difficulties and i have been unwilling to write upon it because i do not see my way i will only here advert to one difficulty what constitutes an invention? few simple mechanical contrivances are new; and most combinations may be viewed as species and classed under genera of more or less generality; and may in consequence be pronounced old or new according to the mechanical knowledge of the person who gives his opinion some of my critics have amused their readers with the wildness of the schemes i have occasionally thrown out; and i myself have sometimes smiled along with them perhaps it were wiser for present reputation to offer nothing but profoundly meditated plans but i do not think knowledge will be most advanced by that course; such sparks may kindle the energies of other minds more favourably circumstanced for pursuing the enquiries thus i have now ventured to give some speculations on the mode of blowing furnaces for smelting iron; and even supposing them to be visionary it is of some importance thus to call the attention of a large population engaged in one of our most extensive manufactures to the singular fact that fourfifths of the steam power used to blow their furnaces actually cools them i have collected with some pains the criticisms* on the first edition of this work and have availed myself of much information which has been communicated to me by my friends for the improvement of the present volume if i have succeeded in expressing what i had to explain with perspicuity i am aware that much of this clearness is due to my friend dr fitton to whom both the present and the former edition are indebted for such an examination and correction as an author himself has very rarely the power to bestow  *footnote several of these have probably escaped me and i shall feel indebted to any one who will inform my publisher of any future remarks  november section i introduction the object of the present volume is to point out the effects and the advantages which arise from the use of tools and machines;to endeavour to classify their modes of action;and to trace both the causes and the consequences of applying machinery to supersede the skill and power of the human arm a view of the mechanical part of the subject will in the first instance occupy our attention and to this the first section of the work will be devoted the first chapter of the section will contain some remarks on the general sources from whence the advantages of machinery are derived and the succeeding nine chapters will contain a detailed examination of principles of a less general character the eleventh chapter contains numerous subdivisions and is important from the extensive classification it affords of the arts in which copying is so largely employed the twelfth chapter which completes the first section contains a few suggestions for the assistance of those who propose visiting manufactories the second section after an introductory chapter on the difference between making and manufacturing will contain in the succeeding chapters a discussion of many of the questions which relate to the political economy of the subject it was found that the domestic arrangement or interior economy of factories was so interwoven with the more general questions that it was deemed unadvisable to separate the two subjects the concluding chapter of this section and of the work itself relates to the future prospects of manufactures as arising from the application of science  chapter  sources of the advantages arising from machinery and manufactures  there exists perhaps no single circumstance which distinguishes our country more remarkably from all others than the vast extent and perfection to which we have carried the contrivance of tools and machines for forming those conveniences of which so large a quantity is consumed by almost every class of the community the amount of patient thought of repeated experiment of happy exertion of genius by which our manufactures have been created and carried to their present excellence is scarcely to be imagined if we look around the rooms we inhabit or through those storehouses of every convenience of every luxury that man can desire which deck the crowded streets of our larger cities we shall find in the history of each article of every fabric a series of failures which have gradually led the way to excellence; and we shall notice in the art of making even the most insignificant of them processes calculated to excite our admiration by their simplicity or to rivet our attention by their unlookedfor results  the accumulation of skill and science which has been directed to diminish the difficulty of producing manufactured goods has not been beneficial to that country alone in which it is concentrated; distant kingdoms have participated in its advantages the luxurious natives of the east* and the ruder inhabitants of the african desert are alike indebted to our looms the produce of our factories has preceded even our most enterprising travellers* the cotton of india is conveyed by british ships round half our planet to be woven by british skill in the factories of lancashire it is again set in motion by british capital; and transported to the very plains whereon it grew is repurchased by the lords of the soil which gave it birth at a cheaper price than that at which their coarser machinery enables them to manufacture it themselves*  the large proportion of the population of this country who are engaged in manufactures appears from the following table deduced from a statement in an essay on the distribution of wealth by the rev r jones for every hundred persons employed in agriculture there are     agriculturists nonagriculturists  in bengal     in italy     in france     in england     the fact that the proportion of nonagricultural to agricultural persons is continually increasing appears both from the report of the committee of the house of commons upon manufacturers' employment july and from the still later evidence of the last census; from which document the annexed table of the increase of population in our great manufacturing towns has been deduced increase of population per cent names of places      total manchester      glasgow       liverpool*      nottingham      birmingham      great britain     thus in three periods of ten years during each of which the general population of the country has increased about per cent or about per cent upon the whole period of thirty years the population of these towns has on the average increased per cent after this statement there requires no further argument to demonstrate the vast importance to the wellbeing of this country of making the interests of its manufacturers well understood and attended to  the advantages which are derived from machinery and manufactures seem to arise principally from three sources the addition which they make to human power the economy they produce of human time the conversion of substances apparently common and worthless into valuable products  of additions to human power with respect to the first of these causes the forces derived from wind from water and from steam present themselves to the mind of every one; these are in fact additions to human power and will be considered in a future page there are however other sources of its increase by which the animal force of the individual is itself made to act with far greater than its unassisted power; and to these we shall at present confine our observations the construction of palaces of temples and of tombs seems to have occupied the earliest attention of nations just entering on the career of civilization; and the enormous blocks of stone moved from their native repositories to minister to the grandeur or piety of the builders have remained to excite the astonishment of their posterity long after the purposes of many of these records as well as the names of their founders have been forgotten the different degrees of force necessary to move these ponderous masses will have varied according to the mechanical knowledge of the people employed in their transport; and that the extent of power required for this purpose is widely different under different circumstances will appear from the following experiment which is related by m rondelet sur l'art de batir a block of squared stone was taken for the subject of experiment  weight of stone lbs  in order to drag this stone along the floor of the quarry roughly chiselled it required a force equal to lbs  the same stone dragged over a floor of planks required lbs  the same stone placed on a platform of wood and dragged over a floor of planks required lbs  after soaping the two surfaces of wood which slid over each other it required lbs  the same stone was now placed upon rollers of three inches diameter when it required to put it in motion along the floor of the quarry lbs  to drag it by these rollers over a wooden floor lbs  when the stone was mounted on a wooden platform and the same rollers placed between that and a plank floor it required lbs  from this experiment it results that the force necessary to move a stone along        part of its weight the roughly chiselled floor of its quarry is nearly along a wooden floor       by wood upon wood      if the wooden surfaces are soaped    with rollers on the floor of the quarry   on rollers on wood      on rollers between wood      at each increase of knowledge as well as on the contrivance of every new tool human labour becomes abridged the man who contrived rollers invented a tool by which his power was quintupled the workman who first suggested the employment of soap or grease was immediately enabled to move without exerting a greater effort more than three times the weight he could before*  the economy of human time is the next advantage of machinery in manufactures so extensive and important is this effect that we might if we were inclined to generalize embrace almost all the advantages under this single head but the elucidation of principles of less extent will contribute more readily to a knowledge of the subject; and as numerous examples will be presented to the reader in the ensuing pages we shall restrict our illustrations upon this point as an example of the economy of time the use of gunpowder in blasting rocks may be noticed several pounds of powder may be purchased for a sum acquired by a few days' labour yet when this is employed for the purpose alluded to effects are frequently produced which could not even with the best tools be accomplished by other means in less than many months the dimensions of one of the blocks of limestone extracted from the quarries worked for the formation of the breakwater at plymouth were  ft long ft wide and ft deep this mass containing above cubic feet and weighing about tons was blasted three times two charges of lbs each were successively exploded in a hole feet deep the bore being inches at top and  inches at bottom lbs of powder were afterwards exploded in the rent formed by those operations each pound of gunpowder separated from the rock two tons of matter or nearly times its own weight the expense of the powder was l or nearly d per lb the boring occupied two men during a day and a half and cost about s; and the value of the produce was at that time about l  the simple contrivance of tin tubes for speaking through communicating between different apartments by which the directions of the superintendent are instantly conveyed to the remotest parts of an establishment produces a considerable economy of time it is employed in the shops and manufactories in london and might with advantage be used in domestic establishments particularly in large houses in conveying orders from the nursery to the kitchen or from the house to the stable its convenience arises not merely from saving the servant or workman useless journeys to receive directions but from relieving the master himself from that indisposition to give trouble which frequently induces him to forego a trifling want when he knows that his attendant must mount several flights of stairs to ascertain his wishes and after descending must mount again to supply them the distance to which such a mode of communication can be extended does not appear to have been ascertained and would be an interesting subject for enquiry admitting it to be possible between london and liverpool about seventeen minutes would elapse before the words spoken at one end would reach the other extremity of the pipe  the art of using the diamond for cutting glass has undergone within a few years a very important improvement a glazier's apprentice when using a diamond set in a conical ferrule as was always the practice about twenty years since found great difficulty in acquiring the art of using it with certainty; and at the end of a seven years' apprenticeship many were found but indifferently skilled in its employment this arose from the difficulty of finding the precise angle at which the diamond cuts and of guiding it along the glass at the proper inclination when that angle is found almost the whole of the time consumed and of the glass destroyed in acquiring the art of cutting glass may now be saved by the use of an improved tool the gem is set in a small piece of squared brass with its edges nearly parallel to one side of the square a person skilled in its use now files away the brass on one side until by trial he finds that the diamond will make a clean cut when guided by keeping this edge pressed against a ruler the diamond and its mounting are now attached to a stick like a pencil by means of a swivel allowing a small angular motion thus even the beginner at once applies the cutting edge at the proper angle by pressing the side of the brass against a ruler; and even though the part he holds in his hand should deviate a little from the required angle it communicates no irregularity to the position of the diamond which rarely fails to do its office when thus employed the relative hardness of the diamond in different directions is a singular fact an experienced workman on whose judgement i can rely informed me that he has seen a diamond ground with diamond powder on a castiron mill for three hours without its being at all worn but that on changing its direction with respect to the grinding surface the same edge was ground away  employment of materials of little value the skins used by the goldbeater are produced from the offal of animals the hoofs of horses and cattle and other horny refuse are employed in the production of the prussiate of potash that beautiful yellow crystallized salt which is exhibited in the shops of some of our chemists the wornout saucepans and tinware of our kitchens when beyond the reach of the tinker's art are not utterly worthless we sometimes meet carts loaded with old tin kettles and wornout iron coalskuttles traversing our streets these have not yet completed their useful course; the less corroded parts are cut into strips punched with small holes and varnished with a coarse black varnish for the use of the trunkmaker who protects the edges and angles of his boxes with them; the remainder are conveyed to the manufacturing chemists in the outskirts of the town who employ them in combination with pyroligneous acid in making a black die for the use of calico printers  of tools the difference between a tool and a machine is not capable of very precise distinction; nor is it necessary in a popular explanation of those terms to limit very strictly their acceptation a tool is usually more simple than a machine; it is generally used with the hand whilst a machine is frequently moved by animal or steam power the simpler machines are often merely one or more tools placed in a frame and acted on by a moving power in pointing out the advantages of tools we shall commence with some of the simplest  to arrange twenty thousand needles thrown promiscuously into a box mixed and entangled in every possible direction in such a form that they shall be all parallel to each other would at first sight appear a most tedious occupation; in fact if each needle were to be separated individually many hours must be consumed in the process yet this is an operation which must be performed many times in the manufacture of needles; and it is accomplished in a few minutes by a very simple tool; nothing more being requisite than a small flat tray of sheet iron slightly concave at the bottom in this the needles are placed and shaken in a peculiar manner by throwing them up a very little and giving at the same time a slight longitudinal motion to the tray the shape of the needles assists their arrangement; for if two needles cross each other unless which is exceedingly improbable they happen to be precisely balanced they will when they fall on the bottom of the tray tend to place themselves side by side and the hollow form of the tray assists this disposition as they have no projection in any part to impede this tendency or to entangle each other they are by continually shaking arranged lengthwise in three or four minutes the direction of the shake is now changed the needles are but little thrown up but the tray is shaken endways; the result of which is that in a minute or two the needles which were previously arranged endways become heaped up in a wall with their ends against the extremity of the tray they are then removed by hundreds at a time with a broad iron spatula on which they are retained by the forefinger of the left hand as this parallel arrangement of the needles must be repeated many times if a cheap and expeditious method had not been devised the expense of the manufacture would have been considerably enhanced  another process in the art of making needles furnishes an example of one of the simplest contrivances which can come under the denomination of a tool after the needles have been arranged in the manner just described it is necessary to separate them into two parcels in order that their points may be all in one direction this is usually done by women and children the needles are placed sideways in a heap on a table in front of each operator just as they are arranged by the process above described from five to ten are rolled towards this person with the forefinger of the left hand; this separates them a very small space from each other and each in its turn is pushed lengthwise to the right or to the left according to the direction of the point this is the usual process and in it every needle passes individually under the finger of the operator a small alteration expedites the process considerably the child puts on the forefinger of its right hand a small cloth cap or fingerstall and rolling out of the heap from six to twelve needles he keeps them down by the forefinger of the left hand whilst he presses the forefinger of the right hand gently against their ends those which have the points towards the right hand stick into the fingerstall; and the child removing the finger of the left hand slightly raises the needles sticking into the cloth and then pushes them towards the left side those needles which had their eyes on the right hand do not stick into the finger cover and are pushed to the heap on the right side before the repetition of this process by means of this simple contrivance each movement of the finger from one side to the other carries five or six needles to their proper heap; whereas in the former method frequently only one was moved and rarely more than two or three were transported at one movement to their place  various operations occur in the arts in which the assistance of an additional hand would be a great convenience to the workman and in these cases tools or machines of the simplest structure come to our aid vices of different forms in which the material to be wrought is firmly grasped by screws are of this kind and are used in almost every workshop; but a more striking example may be found in the trade of the nailmaker some kinds of nails such as those used for defending the soles of coarse shoes called hobnails require a particular form of the head which is made by the stroke of a die the workman holds one end of the rod of iron out of which he forms the nails in his left hand; with his right hand he hammers the redhot end of it into a point and cutting the proper length almost off bends it nearly at a right angle he puts this into a hole in a small stakeiron immediately under a hammer which is connected with a treadle and has a die sunk in its surface corresponding to the intended form of the head; and having given one part of the form to the head with the small hammer in his hand he moves the treadle with his foot disengages the other hammer and completes the figure of the head; the returning stroke produced by the movement of the treadle striking the finished nail out of the hole in which it was retained without this substitution of his foot for another hand the workman would probably be obliged to heat the nails twice over  another though fortunately a less general substitution of tools for human hands is used to assist the labour of those who are deprived by nature or by accident of some of their limbs those who have had an opportunity of examining the beautiful contrivances for the manufacture of shoes by machinery which we owe to the fertile invention of mr brunel must have noticed many instances in which the workmen were enabled to execute their task with precision although labouring under the disadvantages of the loss of an arm or leg a similar instance occurs at liverpool in the institution for the blind where a machine is used by those afflicted with blindness for weaving sashlines; it is said to have been the invention of a person suffering under that calamity other examples might be mentioned of contrivances for the use the amusement or the instruction of the wealthier classes who labour under the same natural disadvantages these triumphs of skill and ingenuity deserve a double portion of our admiration when applied to mitigate the severity of natural or accidental misfortune; when they supply the rich with occupation and knowledge; when they relieve the poor from the additional evils of poverty and want  division of the objects of machinery there exists a natural although in point of number a very unequal division amongst machines they may be classed as; first those which are employed to produce power and as secondly those which are intended merely to transmit force and execute work the first of these divisions is of great importance and is very limited in the variety of its species although some of those species consist of numerous individuals of that class of mechanical agents by which motion is transmittedthe lever the pulley the wedge and many others it has been demonstrated that no power is gained by their use however combined whatever force is applied at one point can only be exerted at some other diminished by friction and other incidental causes; and it has been further proved that whatever is gained in the rapidity of execution is compensated by the necessity of exerting additional force these two principles long since placed beyond the reach of doubt cannot be too constantly borne in mind but in limiting our attempts to things which are possible we are still as we hope to shew possessed of a field of inexhaustible research and of advantages derived from mechanical skill which have but just begun to exercise their influence on our arts and may be pursued without limit contributing to the improvement the wealth and the happiness of our race  of those machines by which we produce power it may be observed that although they are to us immense acquisitions yet in regard to two of the sources of this powerthe force of wind and of waterwe merely make use of bodies in a state of motion by nature; we change the directions of their movement in order to render them subservient to our purposes but we neither add to nor diminish the quantity of motion in existence when we expose the sails of a windmill obliquely to the gale we check the velocity of a small portion of the atmosphere and convert its own rectilinear motion into one of rotation in the sails; we thus change the direction of force but we create no power the same may be observed with regard to the sails of a vessel; the quantity of motion given by them is precisely the same as that which is destroyed in the atmosphere if we avail ourselves of a descending stream to turn a waterwheel we are appropriating a power which nature may appear at first sight to be uselessly and irrecoverably wasting but which upon due examination we shall find she is ever regaining by other processes the fluid which is falling from a higher to a lower level carries with it the velocity due to its revolution with the earth at a greater distance from its centre it will therefore accelerate although to an almost infinitesimal extent the earth's daily rotation the sum of all these increments of velocity arising from the descent of all the falling waters on the earth's surface would in time become perceptible did not nature by the process of evaporation convey the waters back to their sources; and thus again by removing matter to a greater distance from the centre destroy the velocity generated by its previous approach  the force of vapour is another fertile source of moving power; but even in this case it cannot be maintained that power is created water is converted into elastic vapour by the combustion of fuel the chemical changes which thus take place are constantly increasing the atmosphere by large quantities of carbonic acid and other gases noxious to animal life the means by which nature decomposes these elements or reconverts them into a solid form are not sufficiently known but if the end could be accomplished by mechanical force it is almost certain that the power necessary to produce it would at least equal that which was generated by the original combustion man therefore does not create power; but availing himself of his knowledge of nature's mysteries he applies his talents to diverting a small and limited portion of her energies to his own wants and whether he employs the regulated action of steam or the more rapid and tremendous effects of gunpowder he is only producing on a small scale compositions and decompositions which nature is incessantly at work in reversing for the restoration of that equilibrium which we cannot doubt is constantly maintained throughout even the remotest limits of our system the operations of man participate in the character of their author; they are diminutive but energetic during the short period of their existence whilst those of nature acting over vast spaces and unlimited by time are ever pursuing their silent and resistless career  in stating the broad principle that all combinations of mechanical art can only augment the force communicated to the machine at the expense of the time employed in producing the effect it might perhaps be imagined that the assistance derived from such contrivances is small this is however by no means the case since the almost unlimited variety they afford enables us to exert to the greatest advantage whatever force we employ there is it is true a limit beyond which it is impossible to reduce the power necessary to produce any given effect but it very seldom happens that the methods first employed at all approach that limit in dividing the knotted root of a tree for fuel how very different will be the time consumed according to the nature of the tool made use of! the hatchet or the adze will divide it into small parts but will consume a large portion of the workman's time the saw will answer the same purpose more quickly and more effectually this in its turn is superseded by the wedge which rends it in a still shorter time if the circumstances are favourable and the workman skilful the time and expense may be still further reduced by the use of a small quantity of gunpowder exploded in holes judiciously placed in the block  when a mass of matter is to be removed a certain force must be expended; and upon the proper economy of this force the price of transport will depend a country must however have reached a high degree of civilization before it will have approached the limit of this economy the cotton of java is conveyed in junks to the coast of china; but from the seed not being previously separated threequarters of the weight thus carried is not cotton this might perhaps be justified in java by the want of machinery to separate the seed or by the relative cost of the operation in the two countries but the cotton itself as packed by the chinese occupies three times the bulk of an equal quantity shipped by europeans for their own markets thus the freight of a given quantity of cotton costs the chinese nearly twelve times the price to which by a proper attention to mechanical methods it might be reduced * notes  'the bandana handkerchiefs manufactured at glasgow have long superseded the genuine ones

diminishing friction that the drivers of sledges in amsterdam on which heavy goods are transported carry in their hand a rope soaked in tallow which they throw down from time to time before the sledge in order that by passing over the rope it may become greased  chapter  accumulating power  whenever the work to be done requires more force for its execution than can be generated in the time necessary for its completion recourse must be had to some mechanical method of preserving and condensing a part of the power exerted previously to the commencement of the process this is most frequently accomplished by a flywheel which is in fact nothing more than a wheel having a very heavy rim so that the greater part of its weight is near the circumference it requires great power applied for some time to put this into rapid motion; but when moving with considerable velocity the effects are exceedingly powerful if its force be concentrated upon a small object in some of the iron works where the power of the steamengine is a little too small for the rollers which it drives it is usual to set the engine at work a short time before the redhot iron is ready to be removed from the furnace to the rollers and to allow it to work with great rapidity until the fly has acquired a velocity rather alarming to those unused to such establishments on passing the softened mass of iron through the first groove the engine receives a great and very perceptible check; and its speed is diminished at the next and at each succeeding passage until the iron bar is reduced to such a size that the ordinary power of the engine is sufficient to roll it  the powerful effect of a large flywheel when its force can be concentrated on a point was curiously illustrated at one of the largest of our manufactories the proprietor was shewing to a friend the method of punching holes in iron plates for the boilers of steamengines he held in his hand a piece of sheetiron threeeighths of an inch thick which he placed under the punch observing after several holes had been made that the punch made its perforations more and more slowly he called to the engineman to know what made the engine work so sluggishly when it was found that the flywheel and punching apparatus had been detached from the steamengine just at the commencement of his experiment  another mode of accumulating power arises from lifting a weight and then allowing it to fall a man even with a heavy hammer might strike repeated blows upon the head of a pile without producing any effect but if he raises a much heavier hammer to a much greater height its fall though far less frequently repeated will produce the desired effect when a small blow is given to a large mass of matter as to a pile the imperfect elasticity of the material causes a small loss of momentum in the transmission of the motion from each particle to the succeeding one; and therefore it may happen that the whole force communicated shall be destroyed before it reaches the opposite extremity  the power accumulated within a small space by gunpowder is well known; and though not strictly an illustration of the subject discussed in this chapter some of its effects under peculiar circumstances are so singular that an attempt to explain them may perhaps be excused if a gun is loaded with ball it will not kick so much as when loaded with small shot; and amongst different kinds of shot that which is the smallest causes the greatest recoil against the shoulder a gun loaded with a quantity of sand equal in weight to a charge of snipeshot kicks still more if in loading a space is left between the wadding and the charge the gun either recoils violently or bursts if the muzzle of a gun has accidentally been stuck into the ground so as to be stopped up with clay or even with snow or if it be fired with its muzzle plunged into water the almost certain result is that it bursts the ultimate cause of these apparently inconsistent effects is that every force requires time to produce its effect; and if the time requisite for the elastic vapour within to force out the sides of the barrel is less than that in which the condensation of the air near the wadding is conveyed in sufficient force to drive the impediment from the muzzle then the barrel must burst if sometimes happens that these two forces are so nearly balanced that the barrel only swells; the obstacle giving way before the gun is actually burst the correctness of this explanation will appear by tracing step by step the circumstances which arise on discharging a gun loaded with powder confined by a cylindrical piece of wadding and having its muzzle filled with clay or some other substance having a moderate degree of resistance in this case the first effect of the explosion is to produce an enormous pressure on everything confining it and to advance the wadding through a very small space here let us consider it as at rest for a moment and examine its condition the portion of air in immediate contact with the wadding is condensed; and if the wadding were to remain at rest the air throughout the tube would soon acquire a uniform density but this would require a small interval of time; for the condensation next the wadding would travel with the velocity of sound to the other end from whence being reflected back a series of waves would be generated which aided by the friction of the tube would ultimately destroy the motion but until the first wave reaches the impediment at the muzzle the air can exert no pressure against it now if the velocity communicated to the wadding is very much greater than that of sound the condensation of the air immediately in advance of it may be very great before the resistance transmitted to the muzzle is at all considerable; in which case the mutual repulsion of the particles of air so compressed will offer an absolute barrier to the advance of the wadding* if this explanation be correct the additional recoil when a gun is loaded with small shot or sand may arise in some measure from the condensation of the air contained between their particles; but chiefly from the velocity communicated by the explosion to those particles of the substances in immediate contact with the powder being greater than that with which a wave can be transmitted through them it also affords a reason for the success of a method of blasting rocks by filling the upper part of the hole above the powder with sand instead of clay rammed hard that the destruction of the gun barrel does not arise from the property possessed by fluids and in some measure also by sand and small shot of pressing equally in all directions and thus exerting a force against a large portion of the interior surface seems to be proved by a circumstance mentioned by le vaillant and other travellers that for the purpose of taking birds without injuring their plumage they filled the barrel of their fowling pieces with water instead of loading them with a charge of shot  the same reasoning explains a curious phenomenon which occurs in firing a still more powerfully explosive substance if we put a small quantity of fulminating silver upon the face of an anvil and strike it slightly with a hammer it explodes; but instead of breaking either the hammer or the anvil it is found that that part of the face of each in contact with the fulminating silver is damaged in this case the velocity communicated by the elastic matter disengaged may be greater than the velocity of a wave traversing steel; so that the particles at the surface are driven by the explosion so near to those next adjacent that when the compelling force is removed the repulsion of the particles within the mass drives back those nearer to the surface with such force that they pass beyond the limits of attraction and are separated in the shape of powder  i the success of the experiment of firing a tallow candle through a deal board would be explained in the same manner by supposing the velocity of a wave propagated through deal to be greater than that of a wave passing through tallow  ii the boiler of a steamengine sometimes bursts even during the escape of steam through the safetyvalve if the water in the boiler is thrown upon any part which happens to be red hot the steam formed in the immediate neighbourhood of that part expands with greater velocity than that with which a wave can be transmitted through the less heated steam; consequently one particle is urged against the next and an almost invincible obstacle is formed in the same manner as described in the case of the discharge of a gun if the safetyvalve is closed it may retain the pressure thus created for a short time and even when it is open the escape may not be sufficiently rapid to remove all impediment; there may therefore exist momentarily within the boiler pressures of various force varying from that which can just lift the safetyvalve up to that which is sufficient if exerted during an extremely small space of time to tear open the boiler itself  this reasoning ought however to be admitted with caution; and perhaps some inducement to examine it carefully may be presented by tracing it to extreme cases it would seem but this is not a necessary consequence that a gun might be made so long that it would burst although no obstacle filled up its muzzle it should also follow that if after the gun is charged the air were extracted from the barrel though the muzzle be then left closed the gun ought not to burst it would also seem to follow from the principle of the explanation that a body might be projected in air or other elastic resisting medium with such force that after advancing a very short space it should return in the same direction in which it was projected notes  see poisson's remarks ecole polytec cahier xxi p chapter  regulating power  uniformity and steadiness in the rate at which machinery works are essential both for its effect and its duration the first illustration which presents itself is that beautiful contrivance the governor of the steamengine which must immediately occur to all who are familiar with that admirable engine wherever the increased speed of the engine would lead to injurious or dangerous consequences this is applied; and it is equally the regulator of the waterwheel which drives a spinningjenny or of the windmills which drain our fens in the dockyard at chatham the descending motion of a large platform on which timber is raised is regulated by a governor; but as the weight is very considerable the velocity of this governor is still further checked by causing its motion to take place in water  another very beautiful contrivance for regulating the number of strokes made by a steamengine is used in cornwall it is called the cataract and depends on the time required to fill a vessel plunged in water the opening of the valve through which the fluid is admitted being adjustable at the will of the engineman  the regularity of the supply of fuel to the fire under the boilers of steamengines is another mode of contributing to the uniformity of their rate and also economizes the consumption of coal several patents have been taken out for methods of regulating this supply the general principle being to make the engine supply the fire with small quantities of fuel at regular intervals by means of a hopper and to make it diminish this supply when the engine works too quickly one of the incidental advantages of this plan is that by throwing on a very small quantity of coal at a time the smoke is almost entirely consumed the dampers of ashpits and chimneys are also in some cases connected with machines in order to regulate their speed  another contrivance for regulating the effect of machinery consists in a vane or fly of little weight but presenting a large surface this revolves rapidly and soon acquires a uniform rate which it cannot greatly exceed because any addition to its velocity produces a much greater addition to the resistance it meets with from the air the interval between the strokes on the bell of a clock is regulated in this way and the fly is so contrived that the interval may be altered by presenting the arms of it more or less obliquely to the direction in which they move this kind of fly or vane is generally used in the smaller kinds of mechanism and unlike the heavy fly it is a destroyer instead of a preserver of force it is the regulator used in musical boxes and in almost all mechanical toys  the action of a fly or vane suggests the principle of an instrument for measuring the altitude of mountains which perhaps deserves a trial since if it succeed only tolerably it will form a much more portable instrument than the barometer it is well known that the barometer indicates the weight of a column of the atmosphere above it whose base is equal to the bore of the tube it is also known that the density of the air adjacent to the instrument will depend both on the weight of air above it and on the heat of the air at that place if therefore we can measure the density of the air and its temperature the height of a column of mercury which it would support in the barometer can be found by calculation now the thermometer gives information respecting the temperature of the air immediately; and its density might be ascertained by means of a watch and a small instrument in which the number of turns made by a vane moved by a constant force should be registered the less dense the air in which the vane revolves the greater will be the number of its revolutions in a given time and tables could be formed from experiments in partially exhausted vessels aided by calculation from which if the temperature of the air and the number of revolutions of the vane are given the corresponding height of the barometer might be found* notes  to persons who may be inclined to experiment upon this or any other instrument i would beg to suggest the perusal of the section 'on the art of observing' observations on the decline of science in england p fellowes chapter  increase and diminution of velocity  the fatigue produced on the muscles of the human frame does not altogether depend on the actual force employed in each effort but partly on the frequency with which it is exerted the exertion necessary to accomplish every operation consists of two parts one of these is the expenditure of force which is necessary to drive the tool or instrument; and the other is the effort required for the motion of some limb of the animal producing the action in driving a nail into a piece of wood one of these is lifting the hammer and propelling its head against the nail; the other is raising the arm itself and moving it in order to use the hammer if the weight of the hammer is considerable the former part will cause the greatest portion of the exertion if the hammer is light the exertion of raising the arm will produce the greatest part of the fatigue it does therefore happen that operations requiring very trifling force if frequently repeated will tire more effectually than more laborious work there is also a degree of rapidity beyond which the action of the muscles cannot be pressed  the most advantageous load for a porter who carries wood up stairs on his shoulders has been investigated by m coulomb; but he found from experiment that a man walking up stairs without any load and raising his burden by means of his own weight in descending could do as much work in one day as four men employed in the ordinary way with the most favourable load  the proportion between the velocity with which men or animals move and the weights they carry is a matter of considerable importance particularly in military affairs it is also of great importance for the economy of labour to adjust the weight of that part of the animal's body which is moved the weight of the tool it urges and the frequency of repetition of these efforts so as to produce the greatest effect an instance of the saving of time by making the same motion of the arm execute two operations instead of one occurs in the simple art of making the tags of bootlaces these tags are formed out of very thin tinned sheetiron and were formerly cut out of long strips of that material into pieces of such a breadth that when bent round they just enclosed the lace two pieces of steel have recently been fixed to the side of the shears by which each piece of tinnediron as soon as it is cut is bent into a semicylindrical form the additional power required for this operation is almost imperceptible and it is executed by the same motion of the arm which produces the cut the work is usually performed by women and children; and with the improved tool more than three times the quantity of tags is produced in a given time*  whenever the work is itself light it becomes necessary in order to economize time to increase the velocity twisting the fibres of wool by the fingers would be a most tedious operation in the common spinningwheel the velocity of the foot is moderate but by a very simple contrivance that of the thread is most rapid a piece of catgut passing round a large wheel and then round a small spindle effects this change this contrivance is common to a multitude of machines some of them very simple in large shops for the retail of ribands it is necessary at short intervals to 'take stock' that is to measure and rewind every piece of riband an operation which even with this mode of shortening it is sufficiently tiresome but without it would be almost impossible from its expense the small balls of sewing cotton so cheap and so beautifully wound are formed by a machine on the same principle and but a few steps more complicated  in turning from the smaller instruments in frequent use to the larger and more important machines the economy arising from the increase of velocity becomes more striking in converting cast into wroughtiron a mass of metal of about a hundredweight is heated almost to white heat and placed under a heavy hammer moved by water or steam power this is raised by a projection on a revolving axis; and if the hammer derived its momentum only from the space through which it fell it would require a considerably greater time to give a blow but as it is important that the softened mass of redhot iron should receive as many blows as possible before it cools the form of the cam or projection on the axis is such that the hammer instead of being lifted to a small height is thrown up with a jerk and almost the instant after it strikes against a large beam which acts as a powerful spring and drives it down on the iron with such velocity that by these means about double the number of strokes can be made in a given time in the smaller tilthammers this is carried still further by striking the tail of the tilthammer forcibly against a small steel anvil it rebounds with such velocity that from three to five hundred strokes are made in a minute in the manufacture of anchors an art in which a similar contrivance is of still greater importance it has only been recently applied  in the manufacture of scythes the length of the blade renders it necessary that the workman should move readily so as to bring every part of it on the anvil in quick succession this is effected by placing him in a seat suspended by ropes from the ceiling so that he is enabled with little bodily exertion to vary his distance by pressing his feet against the block which supports the anvil or against the floor  an increase of velocity is sometimes necessary to render operations possible thus a person may skate with great rapidity over ice which would not support his weight if he moved over it more slowly this arises from the fact that time is requisite for producing the fracture of the ice as soon as the weight of the skater begins to act on any point the ice supported by the water bends slowly under him; but if the skater's velocity is considerable he has passed off from the spot which was loaded before the bending has reached the point which would cause the ice to break  an effect not very different from this might take place if very great velocity were communicated to boats let us suppose a flatbottomed boat whose bow forms an inclined plane with the bottom at rest in still water if we imagine some very great force suddenly to propel this boat the inclination of the plane at the forepart would cause it to rise in the water; and if the force were excessive it might even rise out of the water and advance by a series of leaps like a piece of slate or an oyster shell thrown as a 'duck and drake' if the force were not sufficient to pull the boat out of the water but were just enough to bring its bottom to the surface it would be carried along with a kind of gliding motion with great rapidity; for at every point of its course it would require a certain time before it could sink to its usual draft of water; but before that time had elapsed it would have advanced to another point and consequently have been raised by the reaction of the water on the inclined plane at its forepart  the same fact that bodies moving with great velocity have not time to exert the full effect of their weight seems to explain a circumstance which appears to be very unaccountable it sometimes happens that when footpassengers are knocked down by carriages the wheels pass over them with scarcely any injury though if the weight of the carriage had rested on their body even for a few seconds it would have crushed them to death if the view above taken is correct the injury in such circumstances will chiefly happen to that part of the body which is struck by the advancing wheel  an operation in which rapidity is of essential importance is in bringing the produce of mines up to the surface the shafts through which the produce is raised are sunk at a very great expense and it is of course desirable to sink as few of them as possible the matter to be extracted is therefore raised by steamengines with considerable velocity and without this many of our mines could not be worked with profit  the effect of great velocity in modifying the form of a cohesive substance is beautifully shown in the process for making window glass termed flashing which is one of the most striking operations in our domestic arts a workman having dipped his iron tube into the glass pot and loaded it with several pounds of the melted metal blows out a large globe which is connected with his rod by a short thick hollow neck another workman now fixes to the globe immediately opposite to its neck an iron rod the extremity of which has been dipped in the melted glass; and when this is firmly attached a few drops of water separate the neck of the globe from the iron tube the rod with the globe attached to it is now held at the mouth of a glowing furnace and by turning the rod the globe is made to revolve slowly so as to be uniformly exposed to the heat the first effect of this softening is to make the glass contract upon itself and to enlarge the opening of the neck as the softening proceeds the globe is turned more quickly on its axis and when very soft and almost incandescent it is removed from the fire and the velocity of rotation being still continually increased the opening enlarges from the effect of the centrifugal force at first gradually until at last the mouth suddenly expands or flashes out into one large circular sheet of red hot glass the neck of the original globe which is to become the outer part of the sheet is left thick to admit of this expansion and forms the edge of the circular plate of glass which is called a table the centre presents the appearance of a thick boss or prominence called the bull'seye at the part by which it was attached to the iron rod  the most frequent reason for employing contrivances for diminishing velocity arises from the necessity of overcoming great resistances with small power systems of pulleys the crane and many other illustrations might also be adduced here as examples; but they belong more appropriately to some of the other causes which we have assigned for the advantages of machinery the common smokejack is an instrument in which the velocity communicated is too great for the purpose required and it is transmitted through wheels which reduce it to a more moderate rate  telegraphs are machines for conveying information over extensive lines with great rapidity they have generally been established for the purposes of transmitting information during war but the increasing wants of man will probably soon render them subservient to more peaceful objects a few years since the telegraph conveyed to paris information of the discovery of a comet by m gambart at marseilles the message arrived during a sitting of the french board of longitude and was sent in a note from the minister of the interior to laplace the president who received it whilst the writer of these lines was sitting by his side the object in this instance was to give the earliest publicity to the fact and to assure to m gambart the title of its first discoverer at liverpool a system of signals is established for the purposes of commerce so that each merchant can communicate with his own vessel long before she arrives in the port notes  see transactions of the society of arts chapter  extending the time of action of forces  this is one of the most common and most useful of the employments of machinery the half minute which we daily devote to the windingup of our watches is an exertion of labour almost insensible; yet by the aid of a few wheels its effect is spread over the whole twentyfour hours in our clocks this extension of the time of action of the original force impressed is carried still further; the better kind usually require winding up once in eight days and some are occasionally made to continue in action during a month or even a year another familiar illustration may be noticed in our domestic furniture the common jack by which our meat is roasted is a contrivance to enable the cook in a few minutes to exert a force which the machine retails out during the succeeding hour in turning the loaded spit; thus enabling her to bestow her undivided attention on the other important duties of her vocation a great number of automatons and mechanical toys moved by springs may be classed under this division  a small moving power in the shape of a jack or a spring with a train of wheels is often of great convenience to the experimental philosopher and has been used with advantage in magnetic and electric experiments where the rotation of a disk of metal or other body is necessary thus allowing to the enquirer the unimpeded use of both his hands a vane connected by a train of wheels and set in motion by a heavy weight has also on some occasions been employed in chemical processes to keep a solution in a state of agitation another object to which a similar apparatus may be applied is the polishing of small specimens of minerals for optical experiments  chapter  saving time in natural operations  the process of tanning will furnish us with a striking illustration of the power of machinery in accelerating certain processes in which natural operations have a principal effect the object of this art is to combine a certain principle called tanning with every particle of the skin to be tanned this in the ordinary process is accomplished by allowing the skins to soak in pits containing a solution of tanning matter they remain in the pits six twelve or eighteen months; and in some instances if the hides are very thick they are exposed to the operation for two years or even during a longer period this length of time is apparently required in order to allow the tanning matter to penetrate into the interior of a thick hide the improved process consists in placing the hides with the solution of tan in close vessels and then exhausting the air the effect is to withdraw any air which may be contained in the pores of the hides and to aid capillary attraction by the pressure of the atmosphere in forcing the tan into the interior of the skins the effect of the additional force thus brought into action can be equal only to one atmosphere but a further improvement has been made the vessel containing the hides is after exhaustion filled up with a solution of tan; a small additional quantity is then injected with a forcingpump by these means any degree of pressure may be given which the containing vessel is capable of supporting; and it has been found that by employing such a method the thickest hides may be tanned in six weeks or two months  the same process of injection might be applied to impregnate timber with tar or any other substance capable of preserving it from decay and if it were not too expensive the deal floors of houses might thus be impregnated with alumine or other substances which would render them much less liable to be accidentally set on fire in some cases it might be useful to impregnate woods with resins varnish or oil; and wood saturated with oil might in some instances be usefully employed in machinery for giving a constant but very minute supply of that fluid to iron or steel against which it is worked some idea of the quantity of matter which can be injected into wood by great pressure may be formed from considering the fact stated by mr scoresby respecting an accident which occurred to a boat of one of our whalingships the harpoon having been struck into the fish the whale in this instance dived directly down and carried the boat along with him on returning to the surface the animal was killed but the boat instead of rising was found suspended beneath the whale by the rope of the harpoon; and on drawing it up every part of the wood was found to be so completely saturated with water as to sink immediately to the bottom  the operation of bleaching linen in the open air is one for which considerable time is necessary; and although it does not require much labour yet from the risk of damage and of robbery from long exposure a mode of shortening the process was highly desirable the method now practised although not mechanical is such a remarkable instance of the application of science to the practical purposes of manufactures that in mentioning the advantages derived from shortening natural operations it would have been scarcely pardonable to have omitted all allusion to the beautiful application of chlorine in combination with lime to the art of bleaching  another instance more strictly mechanical occurs in some countries where fuel is expensive and the heat of the sun is not sufficient to evaporate the water from brine springs the water is first pumped up to a reservoir and then allowed to fall in small streams through faggots thus it becomes divided; and presenting a large surface evaporation is facilitated and the brine which is collected in the vessels below the faggots is stronger than that which was pumped up after thus getting rid of a large part of the water the remaining portion is driven off by boiling the success of this process depends on the condition of the atmosphere with respect to moisture if the air at the time the brine falls through the faggots holds in solution as much moisture as it can contain in an invisible state no more can be absorbed from the salt water and the labour expended in pumping is entirely wasted the state of the air as to dryness is therefore an important consideration in fixing the time when this operation is to be performed; and an attentive examination of its state by means of the hygrometer might be productive of some economy of labour  in some countries where wood is scarce the evaporation of salt water is carried on by a large collection of ropes which are stretched perpendicularly in passing down the ropes the water deposits the sulphate of lime which it held in solution and gradually incrusts them so that in the course of twenty years when they are nearly rotten they are still sustained by the surrounding incrustation thus presenting the appearance of a vast collection of small columns  amongst natural operations perpetually altering the surface of our globe there are some which it would be advantageous to accelerate the wearing down of the rocks which impede the rapids of navigable rivers is one of this class a very beautiful process for accomplishing this object has been employed in america a boat is placed at the bottom of the rapid and kept in its position by a long rope which is firmly fixed on the bank of the river near the top an axis having a wheel similar to the paddlewheel of a steamboat fixed at each end of it is placed across the boat; so that the two wheels and their connecting axis shall revolve rapidly being driven by the force of the passing current let us now imagine several beams of wood shod with pointed iron fixed at the ends of strong levers projecting beyond the bow of the boat as in the annexed representation if these levers are at liberty to move up and down and if one or more projecting pieces called cams are fixed on the axis opposite to the end of each lever the action of the stream upon the wheels will keep up a perpetual succession of blows the sharppointed shoe striking upon the rock at the bottom will continually detach small pieces which the stream will immediately carry off thus by the mere action of the river itself a constant and most effectual system of pounding the rock at its bottom is established a single workman may by the aid of a rudder direct the boat to any required part of the stream; and when it is necessary to move up the rapid as the channel is cut he can easily cause the boat to advance by means of a capstan  when the object of the machinery just described has been accomplished and the channel is sufficiently deep a slight alteration converts the apparatus to another purpose almost equally advantageous the stampers and the projecting pieces on the axis are removed and a barrel of wood or metal surrounding part of the axis and capable at pleasure of being connected with or disconnected from the axis itself is substituted the rope which hitherto fastened the boat is now fixed to this barrel; and if the barrel is loose upon the axis the paddlewheel makes the axis only revolve and the boat remains in its place but the moment the axis is attached to its surrounding barrel this begins to turn and winding up the rope the boat is gradually drawn up against the stream; and may be employed as a kind of tugboat for vessels which have occasion to ascend the rapid when the tugboat reaches the summit the barrel is released from the axis and friction being applied to moderate its velocity the boat is allowed to descend  clocks occupy a very high place amongst instruments by means of which human time is economized and their multiplication in conspicuous places in large towns is attended with many advantages their position nevertheless in london is often very ill chosen; and the usual place halfway up on a high steeple in the midst of narrow streets in a crowded city is very unfavourable unless the church happen to stand out from the houses which form the street the most eligible situation for a clock is that it should project considerably into the street at some elevation with a dialplate on each side like that which belonged to the old church of st dunstan in fleet street so that passengers in both directions would have their attention directed to the hour  a similar remark applies with much greater force to the present defective mode of informing the public of the position of the receiving houses for the twopenny and general post in the lowest corner of the window of some attractive shop is found a small slit with a brass plate indicating its important office so obscurely that it seems to be an object rather to prevent its being conspicuous no striking sign assists the anxious enquirer who as the moments rapidly pass which precede the hour of closing torments the passenger with his enquiries for the nearest postoffice he reaches it perhaps just as it is closed; and must then either hasten to a distant part of the town in order to procure the admission of his letters or give up the idea of forwarding them by that post; and thus if they are foreign letters he may lose perhaps a week or a fortnight by waiting for the next packet the inconvenience in this and in some other cases is of perpetual and everyday occurrence; and though in the greater part of the individual cases it may be of trifling moment the sum of all these produces an amount which it is always worthy of the government of a large and active population to attend to the remedy is simple and obvious it would only be necessary at each letterbox to have a light frame of iron projecting from the house over the pavement and carrying the letters g p or t p or any other distinctive sign all private signs are at present very properly prohibited from projecting into the street the passenger therefore would at once know where to direct his attention in order to discover a postoffice; and those letterboxes which occurred in the great thoroughfares could not fail to be generally known  chapter  exerting forces too great for human power and executing operations too delicate for human touch  it requires some skill and a considerable apparatus to enable many men to exert their whole force at a given point; and when this number amounts to hundreds or to thousands additional difficulties present themselves if ten thousand men were hired to act simultaneously it would be exceedingly difficult to discover whether each exerted his whole force and consequently to be assured that each man did the duty for which he was paid and if still larger bodies of men or animals were necessary not only would the difficulty of directing them become greater but the expense would increase from the necessity of transporting food for their subsistence the difficulty of enabling a large number of men to exert their force at the same instant of time has been almost obviated by the use of sound the whistle of the boatswain performs this service on board ships; and in removing by manual force the vast mass of granite weighing above tons on which the equestrian figure of peter the great is placed at st petersburgh a drummer was always stationed on its summit to give the signal for the united efforts of the workmen an ancient egyptian drawing was discovered a few years since by champollion in which a multitude of men appeared harnessed to a huge block of stone on the top of which stood a single individual with his hands raised above his head apparently in the act of clapping them for the purpose of insuring the exertion of their combined force at the same moment of time  in mines it is sometimes necessary to raise or lower great weights by capstans requiring the force of more than one hundred men these work upon the surface; but the directions must be communicated from below perhaps from the depth of two hundred fathoms this communication however is accomplished with ease and certainty by signals the usual apparatus is a kind of clapper placed on the surface close to the capstan so that every man may hear and put in motion from below by a rope passing up the shaft at wheal friendship mine in cornwall a different contrivance is employed there is in that mine an inclined plane passing underground about twothirds of a mile in length signals are communicated by a continuous rod of metal which being struck below the blow is distinctly heard on the surface  in all our larger manufactories numerous instances occur of the application of the power of steam to overcome resistances which it would require far greater expense to surmount by means of animal labour the twisting of the largest cables the rolling hammering and cutting large masses of iron the draining of our mines all require enormous exertions of physical force continued for considerable periods of time other means are had recourse to when the force required is great and the space through which it is to act is small the hydraulic press of bramah can by the exertion of one man produce a pressure of atmospheres; and with such an instrument a hollow cylinder of wrought iron three inches thick has been burst in rivetting together the iron plates out of which steamengine boilers are made it is necessary to produce as close a joint as possible this is accomplished by using the rivets redhot while they are in that state the two plates of iron are rivetted together and the contraction which the rivet undergoes in cooling draws them together with a force which is only limited by the tenacity of the metal of which the rivet itself is made  it is not alone in the greater operations of the engineer or the manufacturer that those vast powers which man has called into action in availing himself of the agency of steam are fully developed wherever the individual operation demanding little force for its own performance is to be multiplied in almost endless repetition commensurate power is required it is the same 'giant arm' which twists 'the largest cable' that spins from the cotton plant an 'almost gossamer thread' obedient to the hand which called into action its resistless powers it contends with the ocean and the storm and rides triumphant through dangers and difficulties unattempted by the older modes of navigation it is the same engine that in its more regulated action weaves the canvas it may one day supersede or with almost fairy fingers entwines the meshes of the most delicate fabric that adorns the female form*  the fifth report of the select committee of the house of commons on the holyhead roads furnishes ample proof of the great superiority of steam vessels the following extracts are taken from the evidence of captain rogers the commander of one of the packets question are you not perfectly satisfied from the experience you have had that the steam vessel you command is capable of performing what no sailing vessel can do? answer yes question during your passage from gravesend to the downs could any squarerigged vessel from a firstrate down to a sloop of war have performed the voyage you did in the time

question at the time you performed that voyage with the weather you have described from the downs to milford if that weather had continued twelve months would any squarerigged vessel have performed it? answer they would have been a long time about it probably would have been weeks instead of days a sailing vessel would not have beat up to milford as we did in twelve months  the process of printing on the silver paper which is necessary for banknotes is attended with some inconvenience from the necessity of damping the paper previously to taking the impression it was difficult to do this uniformly and in the old process of dipping a parcel of several sheets together into a vessel of water the outside sheets becoming much more wet than the others were very apt to be torn a method has been adopted at the bank of ireland which obviates this inconvenience the whole quantity of paper to be damped is placed in a close vessel from which the air is exhausted; water is then admitted and every leaf is completely wetted; the paper is then removed to a press and all the superfluous moisture is squeezed out  the operation of pulverizing solid substances and of separating the powders of various degrees of fineness is common in the arts and as the best graduated sifting fails in effecting this separation with sufficient delicacy recourse is had to suspension in a fluid medium the substance when reduced by grinding to the finest powder is agitated in water which is then drawn off the coarsest portion of the suspended matter first subsides and that which requires the longest time to fall down is the finest in this manner even emery powder a substance of great density is separated into the various degrees of fineness which are required flints after being burned and ground are suspended in water in order to mix them intimately with clay which is also suspended in the same fluid for the formation of porcelain the water is then in part evaporated by heat and the plastic compound out of which our most beautiful porcelain is formed remains it is a curious fact and one which requires further examination than it has yet received that if this mixture be suffered to remain long at rest before it is worked up it becomes useless; for it is then found that the silex which at first was uniformly mixed becomes aggregated together in small lumps this parallel to the formation of flints in the chalk strata deserves attention*  the slowness with which powders subside depends partly on the specific gravity of the substance and partly on the magnitude of the particles themselves bodies in falling through a resisting medium after a certain time acquire a uniform velocity which is called their terminal velocity with which they continue to descend when the particles are very small and the medium dense as water this terminal velocity is soon arrived at some of the finer powders even of emery require several hours to subside through a few feet of water and the mud pumped up into our cisterns by some of the water companies is suspended during a still longer time these facts furnish us with some idea of the great extent over which deposits of river mud may be spread; for if the mud of any river whose waters enter the gulf stream sink through one foot in an hour it might be carried by that stream miles before it had sunk to the depth of or feet  a number of small filaments of cotton project from even the best spun thread and when this thread is woven into muslin they injure its appearance to cut these off separately is quite impossible but they are easily removed by passing the muslin rapidly over a cylinder of iron kept at a dull red heat the time during which each portion of the muslin is in contact with the redhot iron is too short to heat it to the burning point; but the filaments being much finer and being pressed close to the hot metal are burnt the removal of these filaments from patent net is still more necessary for its perfection the net is passed at a moderate velocity through a flame of gas issuing from a very long and narrow slit immediately above the flame a long funnel is fixed which is connected with a large airpump worked by a steamengine the flame is thus drawn forcibly through the net and all the filaments on both sides of it are burned off at one operation previously to this application of the airpump the net acting in the same way although not to the same extent as the wiregauze in davy's safety lamp cooled down the flame so as to prevent the combustion of the filaments on the upper side the airpump by quickening the current of ignited gas removes this inconvenience notes  the importance and diversified applications of the steam engine were most ably enforced in the speeches made at a public meeting held june for the purpose of proposing the erection of a monument to the memory of james watt; these were subsequently printed  some observations on the subject by dr fitton occur in the appendix to captain king's survey of the coast of australia vol ii p london chapter  registering operations  one great advantage which we may derive from machinery is from the check which it affords against the inattention the idleness or the dishonesty of human agents few occupations are more wearisome than counting a series of repetitions of the same fact; the number of paces we walk affords a tolerably good measure of distance passed over but the value of this is much enhanced by possessing an instrument the pedometer which will count for us the number of steps we have made a piece of mechanism of this kind is sometimes applied to count the number of turns made by the wheel of a carriage and thus to indicate the distance travelled an instrument similar in its object but differing in its construction has been used for counting the number of strokes made by a steamengine and the number of coins struck in a press one of the simplest instruments for counting any series of operations was contrived by mr donkin*  another instrument for registering is used in some establishments for calendering and embossing many hundred thousand yards of calicoes and stuffs undergo these operations weekly; and as the price paid for the process is small the value of the time spent in measuring them would bear a considerable proportion to the profit a machine has therefore been contrived for measuring and registering the length of the goods as they pass rapidly through the hands of the operator by which all chance of erroneous counting is avoided  perhaps the most useful contrivance of this kind is one for ascertaining the vigilance of a watchman it is a piece of mechanism connected with a clock placed in an apartment to which the watchman has not access; but he is ordered to pull a string situated in a certain part of his round once in every hour the instrument aptly called a telltale informs the owner whether the man has missed any and what hours during the night  it is often of great importance both for regulations of excise as well as for the interest of the proprietor to know the quantity of spirits or of other liquors which have been drawn off by those persons who are allowed to have access to the vessels during the absence of the inspectors or principals this may be accomplished by a peculiar kind of stopcockwhich will at each opening discharge only a certain measure of fluid the number of times the cock has been turned being registered by a counting apparatus accessible only to the master  the time and labour consumed in gauging the contents of casks partly filled has led to an improvement which by the simplest means obviates a considerable inconvenience and enables any person to read off on a scale the number of gallons contained in any vessel as readily as he does the degree of heat indicated by his thermometer a small stopcock connects the bottom of the cask with a glass tube of narrow bore fixed to a scale on the side of the cask and rising a little above its top the plug of the cock may be turned into three positions in the first it cuts off all communication with the cask in the second it opens a communication between the cask and the glass tube and in the third it cuts off the connection between the cask and the tube and opens a communication between the tube and any vessel held beneath the cock to receive its contents the scale of the tube is graduated by pouring into the cask successive quantities of water while the communication between the cask and the tube is open lines are then drawn on the scale opposite the places in the tube to which the water rises at each addition and the scale being thus formed by actual measurement* the contents of each cask are known by inspection and the tedious process of gauging is altogether dispensed with other advantages accrue from this simple contrivance in the great economy of time which it introduces in making mixtures of different spirits in taking stock and in receiving spirit from the distiller  the gasmeter by which the quantity of gas used by each consumer is ascertained is another instrument of this kind they are of various forms but all of them intended to register the number of cubic feet of gas which has been delivered it is very desirable that these meters should be obtainable at a moderate price and that every consumer should employ them; because by making each purchaser pay only for what he consumes and by preventing that extravagant waste of gas which we frequently observe the manufacturer of gas will be enabled to make an equal profit at a diminished price to the consumer  the sale of water by the different companies in london might also with advantage be regulated by a meter if such a system were adopted much water which is now allowed to run to waste would be saved and an unjust inequality between the rates charged on different houses by the same company be avoided  another most important object to which a meter might be applied would be to register the quantity of water passing into the boilers of steamengines without this our knowledge of the quantity evaporated by different boilers and with fireplaces of different constructions as well as our estimation of the duty of steamengines must evidently be imperfect  another purpose to which machinery for registering operations is applied with much advantage is the determination of the average effect of natural or artificial agents the mean height of the barometer for example is ascertained by noting its height at a certain number of intervals during the twentyfour hours the more these intervals are contracted the more correctly will the mean be ascertained; but the true mean ought to be influenced by each momentary change which has occurred clocks have been proposed and made with this object by which a sheet of paper is moved slowly and uniformly before a pencil fixed to a float upon the surface of the mercury in the cup of the barometer sir david brewster proposed several years ago to suspend a barometer and swing it as a pendulum the variations in the atmosphere would thus alter the centre of oscillation and the comparison of such an instrument with a good clock would enable us to ascertain the mean altitude of the barometer during any interval of the observer's absence* an instrument for measuring and registering the quantity of rain was invented by mr john taylor and described by him in the philosophical magazine it consists of an apparatus in which a vessel that receives the rain falling into the reservoir tilts over as soon as it is full and then presents another similar vessel to be filled which in like manner when full tilts the former one back again the number of times these vessels are emptied is registered by a train of wheels; and thus without the presence of the observer the quantity of rain falling during a whole year may be measured and recorded instruments might also be contrived to determine the average force of traction of horsesof the windof a stream or of any irregular and fluctuating effort of animal or other natural force  clocks and watches may be considered as instruments for registering the number of vibrations performed by a pendulum or a balance the mechanism by which these numbers are counted is technically called a scapement it is not easy to describe but the various contrivances which have been adopted for this purpose are amongst the most interesting and most ingenious to which mechanical science has given birth working models on an enlarged scale are almost necessary to make their action understood by the unlearned reader; and unfortunately these are not often to be met with a very fine collection of such models exists amongst the collection of instruments at the university of prague instruments of this kind have been made to extend their action over considerable periods of time and to register not merely the hour of the day but the days of the week of the month of the year and also to indicate the occurrence of several astronomical phenomena repeating clocks and watches may be considered as instruments for registering time which communicate their information only when the owner requires it by pulling a string or by some similar application an apparatus has recently been applied to watches by which the hand which indicates seconds leaves a small dot of ink on the dialplate whenever a certain stop or detent is pushed in thus whilst the eye is attentively fixed on the phenomenon to be observed the finger registers on the face of the watchdial the commencement and the end of its appearance  several instruments have been contrived for awakening the attention of the observer at times previously fixed upon the various kinds of alarums connected with clocks and watches are of this kind in some instances it is desirable to be able to set them so as to give notice at many successive and distant points of time such as those of the arrival of given stars on the meridian a clock of this kind is used at the royal observatory at greenwich  an earthquake is a phenomenon of such frequent occurrence and so interesting both from its fearful devastations as well as from its connection with geological theories that it becomes important to possess an instrument which shall if possible indicate the direction of the shock as well as its intensity an observation made a few years since at odessa after an earthquake which happened during the night suggests a simple instrument by which the direction of the shock may be determined a glass vase partly filled with water stood on the table of a room in a house at odessa; and from the coldness of the glass the inner part of the vessel above the water was coated with dew several very perceptible shocks of an earthquake happened between three and four o'clock in the morning; and when the observer got up he remarked that the dew was brushed off at two opposite sides of the glass by a wave which the earthquake had caused in the water the line joining the two highest points of this wave was of course that in which the shock travelled this circumstance which was accidentally noticed by an engineer at odessa* suggests the plan of keeping in countries subject to earthquakes glass vessels partly filled with treacle or some unctuous fluid so that when any lateral motion is communicated to them from the earth the adhesion of the liquid to the glass shall enable the observer after some interval of time to determine the direction of the shock in order to obtain some measure of the vertical oscillation of the earth a weight might be attached to a spiral spring or a pendulum might be sustained in a horizontal position and a sliding index be moved by either of them so that the extreme deviations should be indicated by it this however would not give even the comparative measure accurately because a difference in the velocity of the rising or falling of the earth's surface would affect the instrument notes  transactions of the society of arts p  the contrivance is due to mr hencky of high holborn in whose establishment it is in constant use  about seven or eight years since without being aware of sir david brewster's proposal i adapted a barometer as a pendulum to the works of a common eight day clock it remained in my library for several months but i have mislaid the observations which were made  memoires de l'academie des sciences de petersburgh e serie tom i p chapter  economy of the materials employed  the precision with which all operations by machinery are executed and the exact similarity of the articles thus made produce a degree of economy in the consumption of the raw material which is in some cases of great importance the earliest mode of cutting the trunk of a tree into planks was by the use of the hatchet or the adze it might perhaps be first split into three or four portions and then each portion was reduced to a uniform surface by those instruments with such means the quantity of plank produced would probably not equal the quantity of the raw material wasted by the process and if the planks were thin would certainly fall far short of it an improved tool completely reverses the case in converting a tree into thick planks the saw causes a waste of a very small fractional part; and even in reducing it to planks of only an inch in thickness does not waste more than an eighth part of the raw material when the thickness of the plank is still further reduced as is the case in cutting wood for veneering the quantity of material destroyed again begins to bear a considerable proportion to that which is used; and hence circular saws having a very thin blade have been employed for such purposes in order to economize still further the more valuable woods mr brunel contrived a machine which by a system of blades cut off the veneer in a continuous shaving thus rendering the whole of the piece of timber available  the rapid improvements which have taken place in the printing press during the last twenty years afford another instance of saving in the materials consumed which has been well ascertained by measurement and is interesting from its connection with literature in the old method of inking type by large hemispherical balls stuffed and covered with leather the printer after taking a small portion of ink from the inkblock was continually rolling the balls in various directions against each other in order that a thin layer of ink might be uniformly spread over their surface this he again transferred to the type by a kind of rolling action in such a process even admitting considerable skill in the operator it could not fail to happen that a large quantity of ink should get near the edges of the balls which not being transferred to the type became hard and useless and was taken off in the form of a thick black crust another inconvenience also arosethe quantity of ink spread on the block not being regulated by measure and the number and direction of the transits of the inkingballs over each other depending on the will of the operator and being consequently irregular it was impossible to place on the type a uniform layer of ink of the quantity exactly sufficient for the impression the introduction of cylindrical rollers of an elastic substance formed by the mixture of glue and treacle superseded the inkingballs and produced considerable saving in the consumption of ink but the most perfect economy was only to be produced by mechanism when printingpresses moved by the power of steam were introduced the action of these rollers was found to be well adapted to their performance; and a reservoir of ink was formed from which a roller regularly abstracted a small quantity at each impression from three to five other rollers spread this portion uniformly over a slab by most ingenious contrivances varied in almost each kind of press and another travelling roller having fed itself on the slab passed and repassed over the type just before it gave the impression to the paper in order to shew that this plan of inking puts the proper quantity of ink upon the type we must prove firstthat the quantity is not too little this would soon have been discovered from the complaints of the public and the booksellers; and secondly that it is not too great this latter point was satisfactorily established by an experiment a few hours after one side of a sheet of paper has been printed upon the ink is sufficiently dry to allow it to receive the impression upon the other; and as considerable pressure is made use of the tympan on which the side first printed is laid is guarded from soiling it by a sheet of paper called the setoff sheet this paper receives in succession every sheet of the work to be printed acquiring from them more or less of the ink according to their dryness or the quantity upon them it was necessary in the former process after about one hundred impressions to change this setoff sheet which then became too much soiled for further use in the new method of printing by machinery no such sheet is used but a blanket is employed as its substitute; this does not require changing above once in five thousand impressions and instances have occurred of its remaining sufficiently clean for twenty thousand here then is a proof that the quantity of superfluous ink put upon the paper in machineprinting is so small that if multiplied by five thousand and in some instances even by twenty thousand it is only sufficient to render useless a single piece of clean cloth* the following were the results of an accurate experiment upon the effect of the process just described made at one of the largest printing establishments in the metropolis* two hundred reams of paper were printed off the old method of inking with balls being employed; two hundred reams of the same paper and for the same book were then printed off in the presses which inked their own type the consumption of ink by the machine was to that by the balls as four to nine or rather less than onehalf notes  in the very best kind of printing it is necessary in the old method to change the setoff sheet once in twelve times in printing the same kind of work by machinery the blanket is changed once in  this experiment was made at the establishment of mr clowes in stamford street  chapter  of the identity of the work when it is of the same kind and its accuracy when of different kinds  nothing is more remarkable and yet less unexpected than the perfect identity of things manufactured by the same tool if the top of a circular box is to be made to fit over the lower part it may be done in the lathe by gradually advancing the tool of the slidingrest; the proper degree of tightness between the box and its lid being found by trial after this adjustment if a thousand boxes are made no additional care is required; the tool is always carried up to the stop and each box will be equally adapted to every lid the same identity pervades all the arts of printing; the impressions from the same block or the same copperplate have a similarity which no labour could produce by hand the minutest traces are transferred to all the impressions and no omission can arise from the inattention or unskilfulness of the operator the steel punch with which the cardwadding for a fowlingpiece is cut if it once perform its office with accuracy constantly reproduces the same exact circle  the accuracy with which machinery executes its work is perhaps one of its most important advantages it may however be contended that a considerable portion of this advantage may be resolved into saving of time; for it generally happens that any improvement in tools increases the quantity of work done in a given time without tools that is by the mere efforts of the human hand there are undoubtedly multitudes of things which it would be impossible to make add to the human hand the rudest cutting instrument and its powers are enlarged the fabrication of many things then becomes easy and that of others possible with great labour add the saw to the knife or the hatchet and other works become possible and a new course of difficult operations is brought into view whilst many of the former are rendered easy this observation is applicable even to the most perfect tools or machines it would be possible for a very skilful workman with files and polishing substances to form a cylinder out of a piece of steel; but the time which this would require would be so considerable and the number of failures would probably be so great that for all practical purposes such a mode of producing a steel cylinder might be said to be impossible the same process by the aid of the lathe and the slidingrest is the everyday employment of hundreds of workmen  of all the operations of mechanical art that of turning is the most perfect if two surfaces are worked against each other whatever may have been their figure at the commencement there exists a tendency in them both to become portions of spheres either of them may become convex and the other concave with various degrees of curvature a plane surface is the line of separation between convexity and concavity and is most difficult to hit; it is more easy to make a good circle than to produce a straight line a similar difficulty takes place in figuring specula for telescopes; the parabola is the surface which separates the hyperbolic from the elliptic figure and is the most difficult to form if a spindle not cylindrical at its end be pressed into a hole not circular and kept constantly turning there is a tendency in these two bodies so situated to become conical or to have circular sections if a triangularpointed piece of iron be worked round in a circular hole the edges will gradually wear and it will become conical these facts if they do not explain at least illustrate the principles on which the excellence of work formed in the lathe depends  chapter  of copying  the two lastmentioned sources of excellence in the work produced by machinery depend on a principle which pervades a very large portion of all manufactures and is one upon which the cheapness of the articles produced seems greatly to depend the principle alluded to is that of copying taken in its most extensive sense almost unlimited pains are in some instances bestowed on the original from which a series of copies is to be produced; and the larger the number of these copies the more care and pains can the manufacturer afford to lavish upon the original it may thus happen that the instrument or tool actually producing the work shall cost five or even ten thousand times the price of each individual specimen of its power as the system of copying is of so much importance and of such extensive use in the arts it will be convenient to classify a considerable number of those processes in which it is employed the following enumeration however is not offered as a complete list; and the explanations are restricted to the shortest possible detail which is consistent with a due regard to making the subject intelligible operations of copying are effected under the following circumstances by printing from cavities   by stamping by printing from surface  by punching by casting     with elongation by moulding    with altered dimensions  of printing from cavities  the art of printing in all its numerous departments is essentially an art of copying under its two great divisions printing from hollow lines as in copperplate and printing from surface as in block printing are comprised numerous arts  copperplate printing in this instance the copies are made by transferring to paper by means of pressure a thick ink from the hollows and lines cut in the copper an artist will sometimes exhaust the labour of one or two years upon engraving a plate which will not in some cases furnish above five hundred copies in a state of perfection  engravings on steel this art is like that of engraving on copper except that the number of copies is far less limited a banknote engraved as a copperplate will not give above three thousand impressions without a sensible deterioration two impressions of a banknote engraved on steel were examined by one of our most eminent artists* who found it difficult to pronounce with any confidence which was the earliest impression one of these was a proof from amongst the first thousand the other was taken after between seventy and eighty thousand had been printed off  music printing music is usually printed from pewter plates on which the characters have been impressed by steel punches the metal being much softer than copper is liable to scratches which detain a small portion of the ink this is the reason of the dirty appearance of printed music a new process has recently been invented by mr cowper by which this inconvenience will be avoided the improved method which give sharpness to the characters is still an art of copying; but it is effected by surface printing nearly in the same manner as calicoprinting from blocks to be described hereafter the method of printing music from pewter plates although by far the most frequently made use of is not the only one employed for music is occasionally printed from stone sometimes also it is printed with moveable type; and occasionally the musical characters are printed on the paper and the lines printed afterwards specimens of both these latter modes of musicprinting may be seen in the splendid collection of impressions from the types of the press of bodoni at parma but notwithstanding the great care bestowed on the execution of that work the perpetual interruption of continuity in the lines arising from the use of moveable types when the characters and lines are printed at the same time is apparent  calico printing from cylinders many of the patterns on printed calicos are copies by printing from copper cylinders about four or five inches in diameter on which the desired pattern has been previously engraved one portion of the cylinders is exposed to the ink whilst an elastic scraper of very thin steel by being pressed forcibly against another part removes all superfluous ink from the surface previously to its reaching the cloth a piece of calico twentyeight yards in length rolls through this press and is printed in four or five minutes  printing from perforated sheets of metal or stencilling very thin brass is sometimes perforated in the form of letters usually those of a name; this is placed on any substance which it is required to mark and a brush dipped in some paint is passed over the brass those parts which are cut away admit the paint and thus a copy of the name appears on the substance below this method which affords rather a coarse copy is sometimes used for paper with which rooms are covered and more especially for the borders if a portion be required to match an old pattern this is perhaps the most economical way of producing it  coloured impressions of leaves upon paper may be made by a kind of surface printing such leaves are chosen as have considerable inequalities the elevated parts of these are covered by means of an inking ball with a mixture of some pigment ground up in linseed oil; the leaf is then placed between two sheets of paper and being gently pressed the impression from the elevated parts on each side appear on the corresponding sheets of paper  the beautiful red cotton handkerchiefs dyed at glasgow have their pattern given to them by a process similar to stencilling except that instead of printing from a pattern the reverse operation that of discharging a part of the colour from a cloth already dyedis performed a number of handkerchiefs are pressed with very great force between two plates of metal which are similarly perforated with round or lozengeshaped holes according to the intended pattern the upper plate of metal is surrounded by a rim and a fluid which has the property of discharging the red dye is poured upon that plate this liquid passes through the holes in the metal and also through the calico; but owing to the great pressure opposite all the parts of the plates not cut away it does not spread itself beyond the pattern after this the handkerchiefs are washed and the pattern of each is a copy of the perforations in the metalplate used in the process another mode by which a pattern is formed by discharging colour from a previously dyed cloth is to print on it a pattern with paste; then passing it into the dyingvat it comes out dyed of one uniform colour but the paste has protected the fibres of the cotton from the action of the dye or mordant; and when the cloth so dyed is well washed the paste is dissolved and leaves uncoloured all those parts of the cloth to which it was applied  printing from surface  this second department of printing is of more frequent application in the arts than that which has just been considered  printing from wooden blocks a block of box wood is in this instance the substance out of which the pattern is formed the design being sketched upon it the workman cuts away with sharp tools every part except the lines to be represented in the impression this is exactly the reverse of the process of engraving on copper in which every line to be represented is cut away the ink instead of filling the cavities cut in the wood is spread upon the surface which remains and is thence transferred to the paper  printing from moveable types this is the most important in its influence of all the arts of copying it possesses a singular peculiarity in the immense subdivision of the parts that form the pattern after that pattern has furnished thousands of copies the same individual elements may be arranged again and again in other forms and thus supply multitudes of originals from each of which thousands of their copied impressions may flow it also possesses this advantage that woodcuts may be used along with the letterpress and impressions taken from both at the same operation  printing from stereotype this mode of producing copies is very similar to the preceding there are two modes by which stereotype plates are produced in that most generally adopted a mould is taken in plaster from the moveable types and in this the stereotype plate is cast another method has been employed in france instead of composing the work in moveable type it was set up in moveable copper matrices; each matrix being in fact a piece of copper of the same size as the type and having the impression of the letter sunk into its surface instead of projecting in relief a stereotype plate may it is evident be obtained at once from this arrangement of matrices the objection to the plan is the great expense of keeping so large a collection of matrices as the original composition does not readily admit of change stereotype plates can only be applied with advantage to cases where an extraordinary number of copies are demanded or where the work consists of figures and it is of great importance to ensure accuracy trifling alterations may however be made in it from time to time; and thus mathematical tables may by the gradual extirpation of error at last become perfect this mode of producing copies possesses in common with that by moveable types the advantage of admitting the use of woodcuts the copy of the woodcut in the stereotype plate being equally perfect with that of the moveable type this union is of considerable importance and cannot be accomplished with engravings on copper  lettering books the gilt letters on the backs of books are formed by placing a piece of gold leaf upon the leather and pressing upon it brass letters previously heated these cause the gold immediately under them to adhere to the leather whilst the rest of the metal is easily brushed away when a great number of copies of the same volume are to be lettered it is found to be cheaper to have a brass pattern cut with the whole of the proper title this is placed in a press and being kept hot the covers each having a small bit of leafgold placed in the proper position are successively brought under the brass and stamped the lettering at the back of the volume in the reader's hand was executed in this manner  calico printing from blocks this is a mode of copying by surface printing from the ends of small pieces of copper wire of various forms fixed into a block of wood they are all of one uniform height about the eighth part of an inch above the surface of the wood and are arranged by the maker into any required pattern if the block be placed upon a piece of fine woollen cloth on which ink of any colour has been uniformly spread the projecting copper wires receive a portion which they give up when applied to the calico to be printed by the former method of printing on calico only one colour could be used; but by this plan after the flower of a rose for example has been printed with one set of blocks the leaves may be printed of another colour by a different set  printing oilcloth after the canvas which forms the basis of oilcloth has been covered with paint of one uniform tint the remainder of the processes which it passes through are a series of copyings by surface printing from patterns formed upon wooden blocks very similar to those employed by the calico printer each colour requiring a distinct set of blocks those oilcloths with the greatest variety of colours are most expensive there are several other varieties of printing which we shall briefly notice as arts of copying; which although not strictly surface printing yet are more allied to it than that from copperplates  letter copying in one of the modes of performing this process a sheet of very thin paper is damped and placed upon the writing to be copied the two papers are then passed through a rolling press and a portion of the ink from one paper is transferred to the other the writing is of course reversed by this process; but the paper to which it is transferred being thin the characters are seen through it on the other side in their proper position another common mode of copying letters is by placing a sheet of paper covered on both sides with a substance prepared from lampblack between a sheet of thin paper and the paper on which the letter to be despatched is to be written if the upper or thin sheet be written upon with any hard pointed substance the word written with this style will be impressed from the black paper upon both those adjoining it the translucency of the upper sheet which is retained by the writer is in this instance necessary to render legible the writing which is on the back of the paper both these arts are very limited in their extent the former affording two or three the latter from two to perhaps ten or fifteen copies at the same time  printing on china this is an art of copying which is carried to a very great extent as the surfaces to which the impression is to be conveyed are often curved and sometimes even fluted the ink or paint is first transferred from the copper to some flexible substance such as paper or an elastic compound of glue and treacle it is almost immediately conveyed from this to the unbaked biscuit to which it more readily adheres  lithographic printing this is another mode of producing copies in almost unlimited number the original which supplies the copies is a drawing made on a stone of a slightly porous nature the ink employed for tracing it is made of such greasy materials that when water is poured over the stone it shall not wet the lines of the drawing when a roller covered with printing ink which is of an oily nature is passed over the stone previously wetted the water prevents this ink from adhering to the uncovered portions; whilst the ink used in the drawing is of such a nature that the printing ink adheres to it in this state if a sheet of paper be placed upon the stone and then passed under a press the printing ink will be transferred to the paper leaving the ink used in the drawing still adhering to the stone  there is one application of lithographic printing which does not appear to have received sufficient attention and perhaps further experiments are necessary to bring it to perfection it is the reprinting of works which have just arrived from other countries a few years ago one of the paris newspapers was reprinted at brussels as soon as it arrived by means of lithography whilst the ink is yet fresh this may easily be accomplished it is only necessary to place one copy of the newspaper on a lithographic stone; and by means of great pressure applied to it in a rolling press a sufficient quantity of the printing ink will be transferred to the stone by similar means the other side of the newspaper may be copied on another stone and these stones will then furnish impressions in the usual way if printing from stone could be reduced to the same price per thousand as that from moveable types this process might be adopted with great advantage for the supply of works for the use of distant countries possessing the same language for a single copy might be printed off with transfer ink and thus an english work for example might be published in america from stone whilst the original printed from moveable types made its appearance on the same day in england  it is much to be wished that such a method were applicable to the reprinting of facsimiles of old and scarce books this however would require the sacrifice of two copies since a leaf must be destroyed for each page such a method of reproducing a small impression of an old work is peculiarly applicable to mathematical tables the setting up of which in type is always expensive and liable to error but how long ink will continue to be transferable to stone from paper on which it has been printed must be determined by experiment the destruction of the greasy or oily portion of the ink in the character of old books seems to present the greatest impediment; if one constituent only of the ink were removed by time it might perhaps be hoped that chemical means would ultimately be discovered for restoring it but if this be unsuccessful an attempt might be made to discover some substance having a strong affinity for the carbon of the ink which remains on the paper and very little for the paper itself*  lithographic prints have occasionally been executed in colours in such instances a separate stone seems to have been required for each colour and considerable care or very good mechanism must have been employed to adjust the paper to each stone if any two kinds of ink should be discovered mutually inadhesive one stone might be employed for two inks; or if the inkingroller for the second and subsequent colours had portions cut away corresponding to those parts of the stone inked by the previous ones then several colours might be printed from the same stone but these principles do not appear to promise much except for coarse subjects  register printing it is sometimes thought necessary to print from a wooden block or stereotype plate the same pattern reversed upon the opposite side of the paper the effect of this which is technically called register printing is to make it appear as if the ink had penetrated through the paper and rendered the pattern visible on the other side if the subject chosen contains many fine lines it seems at first sight extremely difficult to effect so exact a super position of the two patterns on opposite sides of the same piece of paper that it shall be impossible to detect the slightest deviation; yet the process is extremely simple the block which gives the impression is always accurately brought down to the same place by means of a hinge; this spot is covered by a piece of thin leather stretched over it; the block is now inked and being brought down to its place gives an impression of the pattern to the leather it is then turned back; and being inked a second time the paper intended to be printed is placed upon the leather when the block again descending the upper surface of the paper is printed from the block and its undersurface takes up the impression from the leather it is evident that the perfection of this mode of printing depends in a great measure on finding some soft substance like leather which will take as much ink as it ought from the block and which will give it up most completely to paper impressions thus obtained are usually fainter on the lower side; and in order in some measure to remedy this defect rather more ink is put on the block at the first than at the second impression  of copying by casting  the art of casting by pouring substances in a fluid state into a mould which retains them until they become solid is essentially an art of copying; the form of the thing produced depending entirely upon that of the pattern from which it was formed  of casting iron and other metalspatterns of wood or metal made from drawings are the originals from which the moulds for casting are made so that in fact the casting itself is a copy of the mould; and the mould is a copy of the pattern in castings of iron and metals for the coarser purposes and if they are afterwards to be worked even for the finer machines the exact resemblance amongst the things produced which takes place in many of the arts to which we have alluded is not effected in the first instance nor is this necessary as the metals shrink in cooling the pattern is made larger than the intended copy; and in extricating it from the sand in which it is moulded some little difference will occur in the size of the cavity which it leaves in smaller works where accuracy is more requisite and where few or no after operations are to be performed a mould of metal is employed which has been formed with considerable care thus in casting bullets which ought to be perfectly spherical and smooth an iron instrument is used in which a cavity has been cut and carefully ground; and in order to obviate the contraction in cooling a jet is left which may supply the deficiency of metal arising from that cause and which is afterwards cut off the leaden toys for children are cast in brass moulds which open and in which have been graved or chiselled the figures intended to be produced  a very beautiful mode of representing small branches of the most delicate vegetable productions in bronze has been employed by mr chantrey a small strip of a firtree a branch of holly a curled leaf of broccoli or any other vegetable production is suspended by one end in a small cylinder of paper which is placed for support within a similarly formed tin case the finest river silt carefully separated from all the coarser particles and mixed with water so as to have the consistency of cream is poured into the paper cylinder by small portions at a time carefully shaking the plant a little after each addition in order that its leaves may be covered and that no bubbles of air may be left the plant and its mould are now allowed to dry and the yielding nature of the paper allows the loamy coating to shrink from the outside when this is dry it is surrounded by a coarser substance; and finally we have the twig with all its leaves embedded in a perfect mould this mould is carefully dried and then gradually heated to a red heat at the ends of some of the leaves or shoots wires have been left to afford airholes by their removal and in this state of strong ignition a stream of air is directed into the hole formed by the end of the branch the consequence is that the wood and leaves which had been turned into charcoal by the fire are now converted into carbonic acid by the current of air; and after some time the whole of the solid matter of which the plant consisted is completely removed leaving a hollow mould bearing on its interior all the minutest traces of its late vegetable occupant when this process is completed the mould being still kept at nearly a red heat receives the fluid metal which by its weight either drives the very small quantity of air which at that high temperature remains behind out through the airholes or compresses it into the pores of very porous substance of which the mould is formed  when the form of the object intended to be cast is such that the pattern cannot be extricated from its mould of sand or plaster it becomes necessary to make the pattern with wax or some other easily fusible substance the sand or plaster is moulded round this pattern and by the application of heat the wax is extricated through an opening left purposely for its escape  it is often desirable to ascertain the form of the internal cavities inhabited by molluscous animals such as those of spiral shells and of the various corals this may be accomplished by filling them with fusible metal and dissolving the substance of the shell by muriatic acid; thus a metallic solid will remain which exactly filled all the cavities if such forms are required in silver or any other difficulty fusible metal the shells may be filled with wax or resin then dissolved away; and the remaining waxen form may serve as the pattern from which a plaster mould may be made for casting the metal some nicety will be required in these operations; and perhaps the minuter cavities can only be filled under an exhausted receiver  casting in plaster this is a mode of copying applied to a variety of purposes to produce accurate representations of the human formof statuesor of rare fossilsto which latter purpose it has lately been applied with great advantage in all casting the first process is to make the mould; and plaster is the substance which is almost always employed for the purpose the property which it possesses of remaining for a short time in a state of fluidity renders it admirably adapted to this object and adhesion even to an original of plaster is effectually prevented by oiling the surface on which it is poured the mould formed round the subject which is copied removed in separate pieces and then reunited is that in which the copy is cast this process gives additional utility and value to the finest works of art the students of the academy at venice are thus enabled to admire the sculptured figures of egina preserved in the gallery at munich; as well as the marbles of the parthenon the pride of our own museum casts in plaster of the elgin marbles adorn many of the academies of the continent; and the liberal employment of such presents affords us an inexpensive and permanent source of popularity  casting in wax this mode of copying aided by proper colouring offers the most successful imitations of many objects of natural history and gives an air of reality to them which might deceive even the most instructed numerous figures of remarkable persons having the face and hands formed in wax have been exhibited at various times; and the resemblances have in some instances been most striking but whoever would see the art of copying in wax carried to the highest perfection should examine the beautiful collection of fruit at the house of the horticultural society; the model of the magnificent flower of the new genus rafflesiathe waxen models of the internal parts of the human body which adorn the anatomical gallery of the jardin des plantes at paris and the museum at florenceor the collection of morbid anatomy at the university of bologna the art of imitation by wax does not usually afford the multitude of copies which flow from many similar operations this number is checked by the subsequent stages of the process which ceasing to have the character of copying by a tool or pattern become consequently more expensive in each individual production form alone is given by casting; the colouring must be the work of the pencil guided by the skill of the artist  of copying by moulding  this method of producing multitudes of individuals having an exact resemblance to each other in external shape is adopted very widely in the arts the substances employed are either naturally or by artificial preparation in a soft or plastic state; they are then compressed by mechanical force sometimes assisted by heat into a mould of the required form  of bricks and tiles an oblong box of wood fitting upon a bottom fixed to the brickmaker's bench is the mould from which every brick is formed a portion of the plastic mixture of which the bricks consist is made ready by less skilful hands the workman first sprinkles a little sand into the mould and then throws the clay into it with some force; at the same time rapidly working it with his fingers so as to make it completely close up to the corners he next scrapes off with a wetted stick the superfluous clay and shakes the newformed brick dexterously out of its mould upon a piece of board on which it is removed by another workman to the place appointed for drying it a very skilful moulder has occasionally in a long summer's day delivered from ten to eleven thousand bricks; but a fair average day's work is from five to six thousand tiles of various kinds and forms are made of finer materials but by the same system of moulding among the ruins of the city of gour the ancient capital of bengal bricks are found having projecting ornaments in high relief these appear to have been formed in a mould and subsequently glazed with a coloured glaze in germany also brickwork has been executed with various ornaments the cornice of the church of st stephano at berlin is made of large blocks of brick moulded into the form required by the architect at the establishment of messrs cubitt in gray's inn lane vases cornices and highly ornamented capitals of columns are thus formed which rival stone itself in elasticity hardness and durability  of embossed china many of the forms given to those beautiful specimens of earthenware which constitute the equipage of our breakfast and our dinnertables cannot be executed in the lathe of the potter the embossed ornaments on the edges of the plates their polygonal shape the fluted surface of many of the vases would all be difficult and costly of execution by the hand; but they become easy and comparatively cheap when made by pressing the soft material out of which they are formed into a hard mould the care and skill bestowed on the preparation of that mould are repaid by the multitude it produces in many of the works of the china manufactory one part only of the article is moulded; the upper surface of the plate for example whilst the under side is figured by the lathe in some instances the handle or only a few ornaments are moulded and the body of the work is turned  glass seals the process of engraving upon gems requires considerable time and skill the seals thus produced can therefore never become common imitations however have been made of various degrees of resemblance the colour which is given to glass is perhaps the most successful part of the imitation a small cylindrical rod of coloured glass is heated in the flame of a blowpipe until the extremity becomes soft the operator then pinches it between the ends of a pair of nippers which are formed of brass and on one side of which the device intended for the seal has been carved in relief when the mould has been well finished and care is taken in heating the glass properly the seals thus produced are not bad imitations; and by this system of copying they are so multiplied that the more ordinary kinds are sold at birmingham for three pence a dozen  square glass bottles the round forms which are usually given to vessels of glass are readily produced by the expansion of the air with which they are blown it is however necessary in many cases to make bottles of a square form and each capable of holding exactly the same quantity of fluid it is also frequently desirable to have imprinted on them the name of the maker of the medicine or other liquid they are destined to contain a mould of iron or of copper is provided of the intended size on the inside of which are engraved the names required this mould which is used in a hot state opens into two parts to allow the insertion of the round unfinished bottle which is placed in it in a very soft state before it is removed from the end of the iron tube with which it was blown the mould is now closed and the glass is forced against its sides by blowing strongly into the bottle  wooden snuff boxes snuff boxes ornamented with devices in imitation of carved work or of rose engine turning are sold at a price which proves that they are only imitations the wood or horn out of which they are formed is softened by long boiling in water and whilst in this state it is forced into moulds of iron or steel on which are cut the requisite patterns where it remains exposed to great pressure until it is dry  horn knife handles and umbrella handles the property which horn possesses of becoming soft by the action of water and of heat fits it for many useful purposes it is pressed into moulds and becomes embossed with figures in relief adapted to the objects to which it is to be applied if curved it may be straightened; or if straight it may be bent into any forms which ornament or utility may require; and by the use of the mould these forms may be multiplied in endless variety the commoner sorts of knives the crooked handles for umbrellas and a multitude of other articles to which horn is applied attest the cheapness which the art of copying gives to the things formed of this material  moulding tortoiseshell the same principle is applied to things formed out of the shell of the turtle or the land tortoise from the greatly superior price of the raw material this principle of copying is however more rarely employed upon it; and the few carvings which are demanded are usually performed by hand  tobaccopipe making this simple art is almost entirely one of copying the moulds are formed of iron in two parts each embracing one half of the stem; the line of junction of these parts may generally be observed running lengthwise from one end of the pipe to the other the hole passing to the bowl is formed by thrusting a long wire through the clay before it is enclosed in the mould some of the moulds have figures or names sunk in the inside which give a corresponding figure in relief upon the finished pipe  embossing upon calico calicoes of one colour but embossed all over with raised patterns though not much worn in this country are in great demand in several foreign markets this appearance is produced by passing them between rollers on one of which is figured in intaglio the pattern to be transferred to the calico the substance of the cloth is pressed very forcibly into the cavities thus formed and retains its pattern after considerable use the watered appearance in the cover of the volume in the reader's hands is produced in a similar manner a cylinder of gunmetal on which the design of the watering is previously cut is pressed by screws against another cylinder formed out of pieces of brown paper which have been strongly compressed together and accurately turned the two cylinders are made to revolve rapidly the paper one being slightly damped and after a few minutes it takes an impression from the upper or metal one the glazed calico is now passed between the rollers its glossy surface being in contact with the metal cylinder which is kept hot by a heated iron enclosed within it calicoes are sometimes watered by placing two pieces on each other in such a position that the longitudinal threads of the one are at right angles to those of the other and compressing them in this state between flat rollers the threads of the one piece produce indentations in those of the other but they are not so deep as when produced by the former method  embossing upon leather this art of copying from patterns previously engraved on steel rollers is in most respects similar to the preceding the leather is forced into the cavities and the parts which are not opposite to any cavity are powerfully condensed between the rollers  swaging this is an art of copying practised by the smith in order to fashion his iron and steel into the various forms demanded by his customers he has small blocks of steel into which are sunk cavities of different shapes; these are called swages and are generally in pairs thus if he wants a round bolt terminating in a cylindrical head of larger diameter and having one or more projecting rims he uses a corresponding swaging tool; and having heated the end of his iron rod and thickened it by striking the end in the direction of the axis which is technically called upsetting he places its head upon one part of the lage; and whilst an assistant holds the other part on the top of the hot iron he strikes it several times with his hammer occasionally turning the head one quarter round the heated iron is thus forced by the blows to assume the form of the mould into which it is impressed  engraving by pressure this is one of the most beautiful examples of the art of copying carried to an almost unlimited extent; and the delicacy with which it can be executed and the precision with which the finest traces of the graving tool can be transferred from steel to copper or even from hard steel to soft steel is most unexpected we are indebted to mr perkins for most of the contrivances which have brought this art at once almost to perfection an engraving is first made upon soft steel which is hardened by a peculiar process without in the least injuring its delicacy a cylinder of soft steel pressed with great force against the hardened steel engraving is now made to roll very slowly backward and forward over it thus receiving the design but in relief the cylinder is in its turn hardened without injury and if it be slowly rolled to and fro with strong pressure on successive plates of copper it will imprint on a thousand of them a perfect facsimile of the original steel engraving from which it was made thus the number of copies producible from the same design may be multiplied a thousandfold but even this is very far short of the limits to which the process may be extended the hardened steel roller bearing the design upon it in relief may be employed to make a few of its first impressions upon plates of soft steel and these being hardened become the representatives of the original engraving and may in their turn be made the parents of other rollers each generating copperplates like their prototype the possible extent to which facsimiles of one original engraving may thus be multiplied almost confounds the imagination and appears to be for all practical purposes unlimited this beautiful art was first proposed by mr perkins for the purpose of rendering the forgery of bank notes a matter of great difficulty; and there are two principles which peculiarly adapt it to that object first the perfect identity of all the impressions so that any variation in the minutest line would at once cause detection; secondly that the original plates may be formed by the united labours of several artists most eminent in their respective departments; for as only one original of each design is necessary the expense even of the most elaborate engraving will be trifling compared with the multitude of copies produced from it  it must however be admitted that the principle of copying itself furnishes an expedient for imitating any engraving or printed pattern however complicated; and thus presents a difficulty which none of the schemes devised for the prevention of forgery appear to have yet effectually obviated in attempting to imitate the most perfect banknote the first process would be to place it with the printed side downwards upon a stone or other substance on which by passing it through a rollingpress it might be firmly fixed the next object would be to discover some solvent which should dissolve the paper but neither affect the printingink nor injure the stone or substance to which it is attached water does not seem to do this effectually and perhaps weak alkaline or acid solutions would be tried if however this could be fully accomplished and if the stone or other substance used to retain the impression had those properties which enable us to print from it innumerable facsimiles of the note might obviously be made and the imitation would be complete porcelain biscuit which has recently been used with a black lead pencil for memorandum books seems in some measure adapted for such trials since its porosity may be diminished to any required extent by regulating the dilution of the glazing  gold and silver moulding many of the mouldings used by jewellers consist of thin slips of metal which have received their form by passing between steel rollers on which the pattern is embossed or engraved; thus taking a succession of copies of the devices intended  ornamental papers sheets of paper coloured or covered with gold or silver leaf and embossed with various patterns are used for covering books and for many ornamental purposes the figures upon these are produced by the same process that of passing the sheets of paper between engraved rollers  of copying by stamping  this mode of copying is extensively employed in the arts it is generally executed by means of large presses worked with a screw and heavy flywheel the materials on which the copies are impressed are most frequently metals and the process is sometimes executed when they are hot and in one case when the metal is in a state between solidity and fluidity  coins and medals the whole of the coins which circulate as money are produced by this mode of copying the screw presses are either worked by manual labour by water or by steam power the mint which was sent a few years since to calcutta was capable of coining pieces a day medals which usually have their figures in higher relief than coins are produced by similar means; but a single blow is rarely sufficient to bring them to perfection and the compression of the metal which arises from the first blow renders it too hard to receive many subsequent blows without injury to the die it is therefore after being struck removed to a furnace in which it is carefully heated redhot and annealed after which operation it is again placed between the dies and receives additional blows for medals on which the figures are very prominent these processes must be repeated many times one of the largest medals hitherto struck underwent them nearly a hundred times before it was completed  ornaments for military accoutrements and furniture these are usually of brass and are stamped up out of solid or sheet brass by placing it between dies and allowing a heavy weight to drop upon the upper die from a height of from five to fifteen feet  buttons and nail heads buttons embossed with crests or other devices are produced by the same means; and some of those which are plain receive their hemispherical form from the dies in which they are struck the heads of several kinds of nails which are portions of spheres or polyhedrons are also formed by these means  of a process for copying called in france clichee this curious method of copying by stamping is applied to medals and in some cases to forming stereotype plates there exists a range of temperature previous to the melting point of several of the alloys of lead tin and antimony in which the compound is neither solid nor yet fluid in this kind of pasty state it is placed in a box under a die which descends upon it with considerable force the blow drives the metal into the finest lines of the die and the coldness of the latter immediately solidifies the whole mass a quantity of the halfmelted metal is scattered in all directions by the blow and is retained by the sides of the box in which the process is carried on the work thus produced is admirable for its sharpness but has not the finished form of a piece just leaving the coiningpress the sides are ragged and it must be trimmed and its thickness equalized in the lathe  of copying by punching  this mode of copying consists in driving a steel punch through the substance to be cut either by a blow or by pressure in some cases the object is to copy the aperture and the substance separated from the plate is rejected; in other cases the small pieces cut out are the objects of the workman's labour  punching iron plate for boilers the steel punch used for this purpose is from threeeighths to threequarters of an inch in diameter and drives out a circular disk from a plate of iron from onequarter to five eighths of an inch thick  punching tinned iron the ornamental patterns of open work which decorate the tinned and japanned wares in general use are rarely punched by the workman who makes them in london the art of punching out these patterns in screwpresses is carried on as a separate trade; and large quantities of sheet tin are thus perforated for cullenders winestrainers borders of waiters and other similar purposes the perfection and the precision to which the art has been carried are remarkable sheets of copper too are punched with small holes about the hundredth of an inch in diameter in such multitudes that more of the sheet metal is removed than remains behind; and plates of tin have been perforated with above three thousand holes in each square inch  the inlaid plates of brass and rosewood called buhl work which ornament our furniture are in some instances formed by punching; but in this case both the parts cut out and those which remain are in many cases employed in the remaining illustrations of the art of copying by punching the part made use of is that which is punched out  cards for guns the substitution of a circular disk of thin card instead of paper for retaining in its place the charge of a fowlingpiece is attended with considerable advantage it would however be of little avail unless an easy method was contrived of producing an unlimited number of cards each exactly fitting the bore of the barrel the small steel tool used for this purpose cuts out innumerable circles similar to its cutting end each of which precisely fills the barrel for which it was designed  ornaments of gilt paper the golden stars leaves and other devices sold in shops for the purpose of ornamenting articles made of paper and pasteboard and other fancy works are cut by punches of various forms out of sheets of gilt paper  steel chains the chain used in connecting the mainspring and fusee in watches and clocks is composed of small pieces of sheet steel and it is of great importance that each of these pieces should be of exactly the same size the links are of two sorts; one of them consisting of a single oblong piece of steel with two holes in it and the other formed by connecting two of the same pieces of steel placed parallel to each other and at a small distance apart by two rivets the two kinds of links occur alternately in the chain each end of the single pieces being placed between the ends of two others and connected with them by a rivet passing through all three if the rivet holes in the pieces for the double links are not precisely at equal distances the chain will not be straight and will consequently be unfit for its purpose  copying with elongation  in this species of copying there exists but little resemblance between the copy and the original it is the crosssection only of the thing produced which is similar to the tool through which it passes when the substances to be operated upon are hard they must frequently pass in succession through several holes and it is in some cases necessary to anneal them at intervals  wire drawing the metal to be converted into wire is made of a cylindrical form and drawn forcibly through circular holes in plates of steel at each passage it becomes smaller and when finished its section at any point is a precise copy of the last hole through which it passed upon the larger kinds of wire fine lines may sometimes be traced running longitudinally these arise from slight imperfections in the holes of the drawplates for many purposes of the arts wire the section of which is square or half round is required the same method of making it is pursued except that the holes through which it is drawn are in such cases themselves square or halfround or of whatever other form the wire is required to be a species of wire is made the section of which resembles a star with from six to twelve rays; this is called pinion wire and is used by the clockmakers they file away all the rays from a short piece except from about half an inch near one end this becomes a pinion for a clock; and the leaves or teeth are already burnished and finished from having passed through the drawplate  tube drawing the art of forming tubes of uniform diameter is nearly similar in its mode of execution to wire drawing the sheet brass is bent round and soldered so as to form a hollow cylinder; and if the diameter outside is that which is required to be uniform it is drawn through a succession of holes as in wire drawing if the inside diameter is to be uniform a succession of steel cylinders called triblets are drawn through the brass tube in making tubes for telescopes it is necessary that both the inside and outside should be uniform a steel triblet therefore is first passed into the tube which is then drawn through a succession of holes until the outside diameter is reduced to the required size the metal of which the tube is formed is condensed between these holes and the steel cylinder within; and when the latter is withdrawn the internal surface appears polished the brass tube is considerably extended by this process sometimes even to double its first length  leaden pipes leaden pipes for the conveyance of water were formerly made by casting; but it has been found that they can be made both cheaper and better by drawing them through holes in the manner last described a cylinder of lead of five or six inches in diameter and about two feet long is cast with a small hole through its axis and an iron triblet of about fifteen feet in length is forced into the hole it is then drawn through a series of holes until the lead is extended upon the triblet from one end to the other and is of the proper thickness in proportion to the size of the pipe  iron rolling when cylinders of iron of greater thickness than wire are required they are formed by passing wrought iron between rollers each of which has sunk in it a semicylindrical groove; and as such rollers rarely touch accurately a longitudinal line will usually be observed in the cylinders so manufactured bar iron is thus shaped into all the various forms of round square halfround oval etc in which it occurs in commerce a particular species of moulding is thus made which resembles in its section that part of the frame of a window which separates two adjacent panes of glass being much stronger than wood it can be considerably reduced in thickness and consequently offers less obstruction to the light; it is much used for skylights  it is sometimes required that the iron thus produced should not be of uniform thickness throughout this is the case in bars for railroads where greater depth is required towards the middle of the rail which is at the greatest distance from the supports this form is produced by cutting the groove in the rollers deeper at those parts where additional strength is required so that the hollow which surrounds the roller would if it could be unwound be a mould of the shape the iron is intended to fit  vermicelli the various forms into which this paste is made are given by forcing it through holes in tin plate it passes through them and appears on the other side in long strings the cook makes use of the same method in preparing butter and ornamental pastry for the table and the confectioner in forming cylindrical lozenges of various composition  of copying with altered dimensions  of the pentagraph this mode of copying is chiefly used for drawings or maps the instrument is simple; and although usually employed in reducing is capable of enlarging the size of the copy an automaton figure exhibited in london a short time since which drew profiles of its visitors was regulated by a mechanism on this principle a small aperture in the wall opposite the seat in which the person is placed whose profile is taken conceals a camera lucida which is placed in an adjoining apartment and an assistant by moving a point connected by a pentagraph with the hand of the automaton over the outline of the head causes the figure to trace a corresponding profile  by turning the art of turning might perhaps itself be classed amongst the arts of copying a steel axis called a mandril having a pulley attached to the middle of it is supported at one end either by a conical point or by a cylindrical collar and at the other end by another collar through which it passes the extremity which projects beyond this last collar is formed into a screw by which various instruments called chucks can be attached to it these chucks are intended to hold the various materials to be submitted to the operation of turning and have a great variety of forms the mandril with the chuck is made to revolve by a strap which passes over the pulley that is attached to it and likewise over a larger wheel moved either by the foot or by its connection with steam or water power all work which is executed on a mandril partakes in some measure of the irregularities in the form of that mandril; and the perfect circularity of section which ought to exist in every part of the work can only be ensured by an equal accuracy in the mandril and its collar  rose engine turning this elegant art depends in a great measure on copying circular plates of metal called rosettes having various indentations on the surfaces and edges are fixed on the mandril which admits of a movement either endwise or laterally a fixed obstacle called the 'touch' against which the rosettes are pressed by a spring obliges the mandril to follow their indentations and thus causes the cutting tool to trace out the same pattern on the work the distance of the cutting tool from the centre being usually less than the radius of the rosette causes the copy to be much diminished  copying dies a lathe has been long known in france and recently been used at the english mint for copying dies a blunt point is carried by a very slow spiral movement successively over every part of the die to be copied and is pressed by a weight into all the cavities; while a cutting point connected with it by the machine traverses the face of a piece of soft steel in which it cuts the device of the original die on the same or on a diminished scale the degree of excellence of the copy increases in proportion as it is smaller than the original the die of a crownpiece will furnish by copy a very tolerable die for a sixpence but the chief use to be expected from this lathe is to prepare all the coarser parts and leave only the finer and more expressive lines for the skill and genius of the artist  shoelast making engine an instrument not very unlike in principle was proposed for the purpose of making shoe lasts a pattern last of a shoe for the right foot was placed in one part of the apparatus and when the machine was moved two pieces of wood placed in another part which had been previously adjusted by screws were cut into lasts greater or less than the original as was desired; and although the pattern was for the right foot one of the lasts was for the left an effect which was produced by merely interposing a wheel which reversed the motion between the two pieces of wood to be cut into lasts  engine for copying busts many years since the late mr watt amused himself with constructing an engine to produce copies of busts or statues either of the same size as the original or in a diminished proportion the substances on which he operated were various and some of the results were shewn to his friends but the mechanism by which they were made has never been described more recently mr hawkins who nearly at the same time had also contrived a similar machine has placed it in the hands of an artist who has made copies in ivory from a variety of busts the art of multiplying in different sizes the figures of the sculptor aided by that of rendering their acquisition cheap through the art of casting promises to give additional value to his productions and to diffuse more widely the pleasure arising from their possession  screw cutting when this operation is performed in the lathe by means of a screw upon the mandril it is essentially an art of copying but it is only the number of threads in a given length which is copied; the form of the thread and length as well as the diameter of the screw to be cut are entirely independent of those from which the copy is made there is another method of cutting screws in a lathe by means of one pattern screw which being connected by wheels with the mandril guides the cutting point in this process unless the time of revolution of the mandril is the same as that of the screw which guides the cutting point the number of threads in a given length will be different if the mandril move quicker than the cutting point the screw which is produced will be finer than the original; if it move slower the copy will be more coarse than the original the screw thus generated may be finer or coarser it may be larger or smaller in diameterit may have the same or a greater number of threads than that from which it is copied; yet all the defects which exist in the original will be accurately transmitted under the modified circumstances to every individual generated from it  printing from copper plates with altered dimensions some very singular specimens of an art of copying not yet made public were brought from paris a few years since a watchmaker in that city of the name of gonord had contrived a method by which he could take from the same copperplate impressions of different sizes either larger or smaller than the original design having procured four impressions of a parrot surrounded by a circle executed in this manner i shewed them to the late mr lowry an engraver equally distinguished for his skill and for the many mechanical contrivances with which he enriched his art the relative dimensions of the several impressions were so that the largest was nearly three times the linear size of the smallest; and mr lowry assured me that he was unable to detect any lines in one which had not corresponding lines in the others there appeared to be a difference in the quantity of ink but none in the traces of the engraving; and from the general appearance it was conjectured that the largest but one was the original impression from the copperplate the means by which this singular operation was executed have not been published; but two conjectures were formed at the time which merit notice it was supposed that the artist was in possession of some method of transferring the ink from the lines of a copperplate to the surface of some fluid and of retransferring the impression from the fluid to paper if this could be accomplished the print would in the first instance be of exactly the same size as the copper from which it was derived; but if the fluid were contained in a vessel having the form of an inverted cone with a small aperture at the bottom the liquid might be lowered or raised in the vessel by gradual abstraction or addition through the apex of the cone; in this case the surface to which the printingink adhered would diminish or enlarge and in this altered state the impression might be retransferred to paper it must be admitted that this conjectural explanation is liable to very considerable difficulties; for although the converse operation of taking an impression from a liquid surface has a parallel in the art of marbling paper the possibility of transferring the ink from the copper to the fluid requires to be proved another and more plausible explanation is founded on the elastic nature of the compound of glue and treacle a substance already in use in transferring engravings to earthenware it is conjectured that an impression from the copperplate is taken upon a large sheet of this composition; that this sheet is then stretched in both directions and that the ink thus expanded is transferred to paper if the copy is required to be smaller than the original the elastic substance must first be stretched and then receive the impression from the copperplate on removing the tension it will contract and thus reduce the size of the design it is possible that one transfer may not in all cases suffice; as the extensibility of the composition of glue and treacle although considerable is still limited perhaps sheets of india rubber of uniform texture and thickness may be found to answer better than this composition; or possibly the ink might be transferred from the copper plate to the surface of a bottle of this gum which bottle might after being expanded by forcing air into it give up the enlarged impression to paper as it would require considerable time to produce impressions in this manner and there might arise some difficulty in making them all of precisely the same size the process might be rendered more certain and expeditious by performing that part of the operation which depends on the enlargement or diminution of the design only once; and instead of printing from the soft substance transferring the design from it to stone thus a considerable portion of the work would be reduced to an art already well known that of lithography this idea receives some confirmation from the fact that in another set of specimens consisting of a map of st petersburgh of several sizes a very short line evidently an accidental defect occurs in all the impressions of one particular size but not in any of a different size  machine to produce engraving from medals an instrument was contrived a long time ago and is described in the manuel de tourneur by which copperplate engravings are produced from medals and other objects in relief the medal and the copper are fixed on two sliding plates at right angles to each other so connected that when the plate on which the medal is fixed is raised vertically by a screw the slide holding the copperplate is advanced by an equal quantity in the horizontal direction the medal is fixed on the vertical slide with its face towards the copperplate and a little above it a bar terminating at one end in a tracing point and at the other in a short arm at right angles to the bar and holding a diamond point is placed horizontally above the copper; so that the tracing point shall touch the medal to which the bar is perpendicular and the diamond point shall touch the copperplate to which the arm is perpendicular under this arrangement the bar being supposed to move parallel to itself and consequently to the copper if the tracing point pass over a flat part of the medal the diamond point will draw a straight line of equal length upon the copper; but if the tracing point pass over any projecting part of the medal the deviation from the straight line by the diamond point will be exactly equal to the elevation of the corresponding point of the medal above the rest of the surface thus by the transit of this tracing point over any line upon the medal the diamond will draw upon the copper a section of the medal through that line a screw is attached to the apparatus so that if the medal be raised a very small quantity by the screw the copperplate will be advanced by the same quantity and thus a new line of section may be drawn and by continuing this process the series of sectional lines on the copper produces the representation of the medal on a plane the outline and the form of the figure arising from the sinuosities of the lines and from their greater or less proximity the effect of this kind of engraving is very striking; and in some specimens gives a high degree of apparent relief it has been practised on plate glass and is then additionally curious from the circumstance of the fine lines traced by the diamond being invisible except in certain lights from this description it will have been seen that the engraving on copper must be distorted; that is to say that the projection on the copper cannot be the same as that which arises from a perpendicular projection of each point of the medal upon a plane parallel to itself the position of the prominent parts will be more altered than that of the less elevated; and the greater the relief of the medal the more distorted will be its engraved representation mr john bate son of mr bate of the poultry has contrived an improved machine for which he has taken a patent in which this source of distortion is remedied the head in the title page of the present volume is copied from a medal of roger bacon which forms one of a series of medals of eminent men struck at the royal mint at munich and is the first of the published productions of this new art* the inconvenience which arises from too high a relief in the medal or in the bust might be remedied by some mechanical contrivance by which the deviation of the diamond point from the right line which it would describe when the tracing point traverses a plane would be made proportional not to the elevation of the corresponding point above the plane of the medal but to its elevation above some other parallel plane removed to a fit distance behind it thus busts and statues might be reduced to any required degree of relief  the machine just described naturally suggests other views which seem to deserve some consideration and perhaps some experiment if a medal were placed under the tracing point of a pentagraph an engraving tool substituted for the pencil and a copperplate in the place of the paper; and if by some mechanism the tracing point which slides in a vertical plane could as it is carried over the different elevations of the medal increase or diminish the depth of the engraved line proportionally to the actual height of the corresponding point on the medal then an engraving would be produced free at least from any distortion although it might be liable to objections of a different kind if by any similar contrivance instead of lines we could make on each point of the copper a dot varying in size or depth with the altitude of the corresponding point of the medal above its plane than a new species of engraving would be produced and the variety of these might again be increased by causing the graving point to describe very small circles of diameters varying with the height of the point on the medal above a given plane; or by making the graving tool consist of three equidistant points whose distance increased or diminished according to some determinate law dependent on the elevation of the point represented above the plane of the medal it would perhaps be difficult to imagine the effects of some of these kinds of engraving; but they would all possess in common the property of being projections by parallel lines of the objects represented and the intensity of the shade of the ink would either vary according to some function of the distance of the point represented from some given plane or it would be a little modified by the distances from the same plane of a few of the immediately contiguous points  the system of shading maps by means of lines of equal altitude above the sea bears some analogy to this mode of representing medals and if applied to them would produce a different species of engraved resemblance the projections on the plane of the medal of the section of an imaginary plane placed at successive distances above it with the medal itself would produce a likeness of the figure on the medal in which all the inclined parts of it would be dark in proportion to their inclination other species of engraving might be conceived by substituting instead of the imaginary plane an imaginary sphere or other solid intersecting the figure in the medal  lace made by caterpillars a most extraordinary species of manufacture which is in a slight degree connected with copying has been contrived by an officer of engineers residing at munich it consists of lace and veils with open patterns in them made entirely by caterpillars the following is the mode of proceeding adopted he makes a paste of the leaves of the plant which is the usual food of the species of caterpillar* he employs and spreads it thinly over a stone or other flat substance he then with a camelhair pencil dipped in olive oil draws upon the coating of paste the pattern he wishes the insects to leave open this stone is then placed in an inclined position and a number of the caterpillars are placed at the bottom a peculiar species is chosen which spins a strong web; and the animals commencing at the bottom eat and spin their way up to the top carefully avoiding every part touched by the oil but devouring all the rest of the paste the extreme lightness of these veils combined with some strength is truly surprising one of them measuring twentysix and a half inches by seventeen inches weighed only grains; a degree of lightness which will appear more strongly by contrast with other fabrics one square yard of the substance of which these veils are made weighs  grains whilst one square yard of silk gauze weighs grains and one square yard of the finest patent net weighs  grains the ladies' coloured muslin dresses mentioned in the table subjoined cost ten shillings per dress and each weigh six ounces; the cotton from which they are made weighing nearly six and twoninth ounces avoirdupois weight weight of one square yard of each of the following articles*          weight of       weight cotton used     value  finished of

copying is the foundation may be terminated with an example which has long been under the eye of the reader; although few perhaps are aware of the number of repeated copyings of which these very pages are the subject  they are copies by printing from stereotype plates  these stereotype plates are copied by the art of casting from moulds formed of plaster of paris  these moulds are themselves copied by casting the plaster in a liquid state upon the moveable types set up by the compositor it is here that the union of the intellectual and the mechanical departments takes place the mysteries however of an author's copying form no part of our enquiry although it may be fairly remarked that in numerous instances the mental far eclipses the mechanical copyist  these moveable types the obedient messengers of the most opposite thoughts the most conflicting theories are themselves copies by casting from moulds of copper called matrices  the lower part of those matrices bearing the impressions of the letters or characters are copies by punching from steel punches on which the same characters exist in relief  these steel punches are not themselves entirely exempted from the great principle of art many of the cavities which exist in them such as those in the middle of the punches for the letters a b d e g etc are produced from other steel punches in which these parts are in relief we have thus traced through six successive stages of copying the mechanical art of printing from stereotype plates the principle of copying contributing in this as in every other department of manufacture to the uniformity and the cheapness of the work produced notes  the late mr lowry  i posses a lithographic reprint of a page of a table which appears from the from of the type to have been several years old  the construction of the engraving becomes evident on examining it with a lens of sufficient power to show the continuity of the lines  the phalaena pardilla which feeds on the prunus padus  some of these weights and measures are calculated from a statement in the report of the committee of the house of commons on printed cotton goods; and the widths of the pieces there given are presumed to be the real widths not those by which they are called in the retail shops  chapter  on the method of observing manufactories  having now reviewed the mechanical principles which regulate the successful application of mechanical science to great establishments for the production of manufactured goods it remains for us to suggest a few enquiries and to offer a few observations to those whom an enlightened curiosity may lead to examine the factories of this or of other countries the remarkthat it is important to commit to writing all information as soon as possible after it is received especially when numbers are concernedapplies to almost all enquiries it is frequently impossible to do this at the time of visiting an establishment although not the slightest jealousy may exist; the mere act of writing information as it is communicated orally is a great interruption to the examination of machinery in such cases therefore it is advisable to have prepared beforehand the questions to be asked and to leave blanks for the answers which may be quickly inserted as in a multitude of cases they are merely numbers those who have not tried this plan will be surprised at the quantity of information which may through its means be acquired even by a short examination each manufacture requires its own list of questions which will be better drawn up after the first visit the following outline which is very generally applicable may suffice for an illustration; and to save time it may be convenient to have it printed; and to bind up in the form of a pocketbook a hundred copies of the skeleton forms for processes with about twenty of the general enquiries  general enquiries  outlines of a description of any of the mechanical arts ought to contain information on the following points brief sketch of its history particularly the date of its invention and of its introduction into england short reference to the previous states through which the material employed has passed the places whence it is procured the price of a given quantity the various processes must now be described successively according to the plan which will be given in ; after which the following information should be given are various kinds of the same article made in one establishment or at different ones and are there differences in the processes? to what defects are the goods liable? what substitutes or adulterations are used? what waste is allowed by the master? what tests are there of the goodness of the manufactured articles? the weight of a given quantity or number and a comparison with that of the raw material? the wholesale price at the manufactory? l s d per the usual retail price? l s d who provide tools? master or men? who repair tools? master or men? what is the expense of the machinery? what is the annual wear and tear and what its duration? is there any particular trade for making it? where? is it made and repaired at the manufactory? in any manufactory visited state the number  of processes; and of the persons employed in each process; and the quantity of manufactured produce what quantity is made annually in great britain? is the capital invested in manufactories large or small? mention the principal seats of this manufacture in england; and if it flourishes abroad the places where it is established the duty excise or bounty if any should be stated and any alterations in past years; and also the amount exported or imported for a series of years whether the same article but of superior equal or inferior make is imported? does the manufacturer export or sell to a middleman who supplies the merchant? to what countries is it chiefly sent? and in what goods are the returns made?  each process requires a separate skeleton and the following outline will be sufficient for many different manufactories  process  manufacture  place  name  date  the mode of executing it with sketches of the tools or machine if necessary the number of persons necessary to attend the machine are the operatives men  women  or children?  if mixed what are the proportions? what is the pay of each? s d s d s d per  what number  of hours do they work per day? is it usual or necessary to work night and day without stopping? is the labour performed by pieceor by daywork? who provide tools? master or men? who repair tools? master or men? what degree of skill is required and how many years'  apprenticeship? the number of times  the operation is repeated per day or per hour? the number of failures  in a thousand? whether the workmen or the master loses by the broken or damaged articles? what is done with them? if the same process is repeated several times state the diminution or increase of measure and the loss if any at each repetition  in this skeleton the answers to the questions are in some cases printed as who repair the tools?masters men; in order that the proper answer may be underlined with a pencil in filling up the answers which require numbers some care should be taken for instance if the observer stands with his watch in his hand before a person heading a pin the workman will almost certainly increase his speed and the estimate will be too large a much better average will result from enquiring what quantity is considered a fair day's work when this cannot be ascertained the number of operations performed in a given time may frequently be counted when the workman is quite unconscious that any person is observing him thus the sound made by the motion of a loom may enable the observer to count the number of strokes per minute even though he is outside the building in which it is contained m coulomb who had great experience in making such observations cautions those who may repeat his experiments against being deceived by such circumstances 'je prie' says he 'ceux qui voudront les repeter s'ils n'ont pas le temps de mesurer les resultats apres plusiers jours d'un travail continu d'observer les ouvriers a differentes reprises dans la journee sans qu'ils sachent qu'ils sont observes l'on ne peut trop avertir combien l'on risque de se tromper en calculant soit la vitesse soit le temps effectif du travail d'apres une observation de quelques minutes' memoires de l'institut vol ii p it frequently happens that in a series of answers to such questions there are some which although given directly may also be deduced by a short calculation from others that are given or known; and advantage should always be taken of these verifications in order to confirm the accuracy of the statements; or in case they are discordant to correct the apparent anomalies in putting lists of questions into the hands of a person undertaking to give information upon any subject it is in some cases desirable to have an estimate of the soundness of his judgement the questions can frequently be so shaped that some of them may indirectly depend on others; and one or two may be inserted whose answers can be obtained by other methods nor is this process without its advantages in enabling us to determine the value of our own judgement the habit of forming an estimate of the magnitude of any object or the frequency of any occurrence immediately previous to our applying to it measure or number tends materially to fix the attention and to improve the judgement section ii on the domestic and political economy of manufactures  chapter  distinction between making and manufacturing  the economical principles which regulate the application of machinery and which govern the interior of all our great factories are quite as essential to the prosperity of a great commercial country as are those mechanical principles the operation of which has been illustrated in the preceding section the first object of every person who attempts to make any article of consumption is or ought to be to produce it in a perfect form; but in order to secure to himself the greatest and most permanent profit he must endeavour by every means in his power to render the new luxury or want which he has created cheap to those who consume it the larger number of purchasers thus obtained will in some measure secure him from the caprices of fashion whilst it furnishes a far greater amount of profit although the contribution of each individual is diminished the importance of collecting data for the purpose of enabling the manufacturer to ascertain how many additional customers he will acquire by a given reduction in the price of the article he makes cannot be too strongly pressed upon the attention of those who employ themselves in statistical enquiries in some ranks of society no diminution of price can bring forward a great additional number of customers; whilst amongst other classes a very small reduction will so enlarge the sale as to yield a considerable increase of profit materials calculated to assist in forming a table of the numbers of persons who possess incomes of different amount occur in the th report of the commissioners of revenue inquiry which includes a statement of the amount of personal property proved at the legacy office during one year; the number of the various classes of testators; and an account of the number of persons receiving dividends from funded property distributed into classes such a table formed even approximately and exhibited in the form of a curve might be of service  a considerable difference exists between the terms making and manufacturing the former refers to the production of a small the latter to that of a very large number of individuals; and the difference is well illustrated in the evidence given before the committee of the house of commons on the export of tools and machinery on that occasion mr maudslay stated that he had been applied to by the navy board to make iron tanks for ships and that he was rather unwilling to do so as he considered it to be out of his line of business; however he undertook to make one as a trial the holes for the rivets were punched by handpunching with presses and the holes which each tank required cost seven shillings the navy board who required a large number proposed that he should supply forty tanks a week for many months the magnitude of the order made it worth his while to commence manufacture and to make tools for the express business mr maudslay therefore offered if the board would give him an order for two thousand tanks to supply them at the rate of eighty per week the order was given he made tools by which the expense of punching the rivetholes of each tank was reduced from seven shillings to ninepence; he supplied ninetyeight tanks a week for six months and the price charged for each was reduced from seventeen pounds to fifteen  if therefore the maker of an article wish to become a manufacturer in the more extended sense of the term he must attend to other principles besides those mechanical ones on which the successful execution of his work depends; and he must carefully arrange the whole system of his factory in such a manner that the article he sells to the public may be produced at as small a cost as possible should he not be actuated at first by motives so remote he will in every highly civilized country be compelled by the powerful stimulus of competition to attend to the principles of the domestic economy of manufactures at every reduction in price of the commodity he makes he will be driven to seek compensation in a saving of expense in some of the processes; and his ingenuity will be sharpened in this enquiry by the hope of being able in his turn to undersell his rivals the benefit of the improvements thus engendered is for a short time confined to those from whose ingenuity they derive their origin; but when a sufficient experience has proved their value they become generally adopted until in their turn they are superseded by other more economical methods  chapter  of money as a medium of exchange  in the earlier stages of societies the interchange of the few commodities required was conducted by barter but as soon as their wants became more varied and extensive the necessity of having some common measure of the value of all commodities itself capable of subdivisionbecame apparent thus money was introduced in some countries shells have been employed for this purpose; but civilized nations have by common consent adopted the precious metals* the sovereign power has in most countries assumed the right of coining; or in other words the right of stamping with distinguishing marks pieces of metal having certain forms and weights and a certain degree of fineness the marks becoming a guarantee to the people amongst whom the money circulates that each piece is of the required weight and quality the expense of manufacturing gold into coin and that of the loss arising from wear as well as of interest on the capital invested in it must either be defrayed by the state or be compensated by a small reduction in its weight and is a far less cost to the nation than the loss of time and inconvenience which would arise from a system of exchange or barter  these coins are liable to two inconveniences they may be manufactured privately by individuals of the same quality and similarly stamped; or imitations may be made of inferior metal or of diminished weight the first of these inconveniences would be easily remedied by making the current value of the coin nearly equal to that of the same weight of the metal; and the second would be obviated by the caution of individuals in examining the external characters of each coin and partly by the punishment inflicted by the state on the perpetrators of such frauds  the subdivisions of money vary in different countries and much time may be lost by an inconvenient system of division the effect is felt in keeping extensive accounts and particularly in calculating the interest on loans or the discount upon bills of exchange the decimal system is the best adapted to facilitate all such calculations; and it becomes an interesting question to consider whether our own currency might not be converted into one decimally divided the great step that of abolishing the guinea has already been taken without any inconvenience and but little is now required to render the change complete  if whenever it becomes necessary to call in the halfcrowns a new coin of the value of two shillings were issued which should be called by some name implying a unit a prince for instance we should have the tenth part of a sovereign a few years after when the public were familiar with this coin it might be divided into one hundred instead of ninetysix farthings; and it would then consist of twentyfive pence each of which would be four per cent less in value than the former penny the shillings and sixpences being then withdrawn from circulation their place might be supplied with silver coins each worth five of the new pence and by others of tenpence and of twopence halfpenny; the latter coin having a distinct name would be the tenth part of a prince  the various manufactured commodities and the various property possessed by the inhabitants of a country all become measured by the standard thus introduced but it must be observed that the value of gold is itself variable; and that like all other commodities its price depends on the extent of the demand compared with that of the supply  as transactions multiply and the sums to be paid become large the actual transfer of the precious metals from one individual to another is attended with inconvenience and difficulty and it is found more convenient to substitute written promises to pay on demand specified quantities of gold these promises are called banknotes; and when the person or body issuing them is known to be able to fulfil the pledge the note will circulate for a long time before it gets into the hands of any person who may wish to make use of the gold it represents these paper representatives supply the place of a certain quantity of gold; and being much cheaper a large portion of the expense of a metallic circulation is saved by their employment  as commercial transactions increase the transfer of banknotes is to a considerable extent superseded by shorter processes banks are established into which all monies are paid and out of which all payments are made through written orders called checks drawn by those who keep accounts with them in a large capital each bank receives through its numerous customers checks payable by every other; and if clerks were sent round to receive the amount in banknotes due from each it would occupy much time and be attended with some risk and inconvenience  clearing house in london this is avoided by making all checks paid in to bankers pass through what is technically called the clearing house in a large room in lombard street about thirty clerks from the several london bankers take their stations in alphabetical order at desks placed round the room; each having a small open box by his side and the name of the firm to which he belongs in large characters on the wall above his head from time to time other clerks from every house enter the room and passing along drop into the box the checks due by that firm to the house from which this distributor is sent the clerk at the table enters the amount of the several checks in a book previously prepared under the name of the bank to which they are respectively due four o'clock in the afternoon is the latest hour to which the boxes are open to receive checks; and at a few minutes before that time some signs of increased activity begin to appear in this previously quiet and businesslike scene numerous clerks then arrive anxious to distribute up to the latest possible moment the checks which have been paid into the houses of their employers at four o'clock all the boxes are removed and each clerk adds up the amount of the checks put into his box and payable by his own to other houses he also receives another book from his own house containing the amounts of the checks which their distributing clerk has put into the box of every other banker having compared these he writes out the balances due to or from his own house opposite the name of each of the other banks; and having verified this statement by a comparison with the similar list made by the clerks of those houses he sends to his own bank the general balance resulting from this sheet the amount of which if it is due from that to other houses is sent back in banknotes at five o'clock the inspector takes his seat; when each clerk who has upon the result of all the transactions a balance to pay to various other houses pays it to the inspector who gives a ticket for the amount the clerks of those houses to whom money is due then receive the several sums from the inspector who takes from them a ticket for the amount thus the whole of these payments are made by a double system of balance a very small amount of banknotes passing from hand to hand and scarcely any coin  it is difficult to form a satisfactory estimate of the sums which daily pass through this operation they fluctuate from two millions to perhaps fifteen about two millions and a half may possibly be considered as something like an average requiring for its adjustment perhaps l in bank notes and l in specie by an agreement between the different bankers all checks which have the name of any firm written across them must pass through the clearing house consequently if any such check should be lost the firm on which it is drawn would refuse to pay it at the counter; a circumstance which adds greatly to the convenience of commerce the advantage of this system is such that two meetings a day have been recently establishedone at twelve the other at three o'clock; but the payment of balances takes place once only at five o'clock if all the private banks kept accounts with the bank of england it would be possible to carry on the whole of these transactions with a still smaller quantity of circulating medium  in reflecting on the facility with which these vast transactions are accomplishedsupposing for the sake of argument that they form only the fourth part of the daily transactions of the whole communityit is impossible not to be struck with the importance of interfering as little as possible with their natural adjustment each payment indicates a transfer of property made for the benefit of both parties; and if it were possible which it is not to place by legal or other means some impediment in the way which only amounted to oneeighth per cent such a species of friction would produce a useless expenditure of nearly four millions annually a circumstance which is deserving the attention of those who doubt the good policy of the expense incurred by using the precious metals for one portion of the currency of the country  one of the most obvious differences between a metallic and a paper circulation is that the coin can never by any panic or national danger be reduced below the value of bullion in other civilized countries; whilst a paper currency may from the action of such causes totally lose its value both metallic and paper money it is true may be depreciated but with very different effects  depreciation of coin the state may issue coin of the same nominal value but containing only half the original quantity of gold mixed with some cheap alloy; but every piece so issued bears about with it internal evidence of the amount of the depreciation it is not necessary that every successive proprietor should analyse the new coin; but a few having done so its intrinsic worth becomes publicly known of course the coin previously in circulation is now more valuable as bullion and quickly disappears all future purchases adjust themselves to the new standard and prices are quickly doubled; but all past contracts also are vitiated and all persons to whom money is owing if compelled to receive payment in the new coin are robbed of onehalf of their debt which is confiscated for the benefit of the debtor  depreciation of paper the depreciation of paper money follows a different course if by any act of the government paper is ordained to be a legal tender for debts and at the same time ceases to be exchangeable for coin those who have occasion to purchase of foreigners who are not compelled to take the notes will make some of their payments in gold; and if the issue of paper unchecked by the power of demanding the gold it represents be continued the whole of the coin will soon disappear but the public who are obliged to take the notes are unable by any internal evidence to detect the extent of their depreciation; it varies with the amount in circulation and may go on till the notes shall be worth little more than the paper on which they are printed during the whole of this time every creditor is suffering to an extent which he cannot measure; and every bargain is rendered uncertain in its advantage by the continually changing value of the medium through which it is conducted this calamitous course has actually been run in several countries in france it reached nearly its extreme limit during the existence of assignats we have ourselves experienced some portion of the misery it creates; but by a return to sounder principles have happily escaped the destruction and ruin which always attends the completion of that career  every person in a civilized country requires according to his station in life the use of a certain quantity of money to make the ordinary purchases of the articles which he consumes the same individual pieces of coin it is true circulate again and again in the same district the identical piece of silver received by the workman on saturday night passing through the hands of the butcher the baker and the small tradesman is perhaps given by the latter to the manufacturer in exchange for his check and is again paid into the hands of the workman at the end of the succeeding week any deficiency in this supply of money is attended with considerable inconvenience to all parties if it be only in the smaller coins the first effect is a difficulty in procuring small change; then a disposition in the shopkeepers to refuse change unless a purchase to a certain amount be made; and finally a premium in money will be given for changing the larger denominations of coin thus money itself varies in price when measured by other money in larger masses and this effect takes place whether the circulating medium is metallic or of paper these effects have constantly occurred and particularly during the late war; and in order to relieve it silver tokens for various sums were issued by the bank of england the inconvenience and loss arising from a deficiency of small money fall with greatest weight on the classes whose means are least; for the wealthier buyers can readily procure credit for their small purchases until their bill amounts to one of the larger coins  as money when kept in a drawer produces nothing few people in any situation of life will keep either in coin or in notes more than is immediately necessary for their use; when therefore there are no profitable modes of employing money a superabundance of paper will return to the source from whence it issued and an excess of coin will be converted into bullion and exported  since the worth of all property is measured by money it is obviously conducive to the general welfare of the community that fluctuations in its value should be rendered as small and as gradual as possible the evils which result from sudden changes in the value of money will perhaps become more sensible if we trace their effects in particular instances assuming as we are quite at liberty to do an extreme case let us suppose three persons each possessing a hundred pounds one of these a widow advanced in years and who by the advice of her friends purchases with that sum an annuity of twenty pounds a year during her life and let the two others be workmen who by industry and economy have each saved a hundred pounds out of their wages; both these latter persons proposing to procure machines for calendering and to commence that business one of these invests his money in a savings' bank; intending to make his own calendering machine and calculating that he shall expend twenty pounds in materials and the remaining eighty in supporting himself and in paying the workmen who assist him in constructing it the other workman meeting with a machine which he can buy for two hundred pounds agrees to pay for it a hundred pounds immediately and the remainder at the end of a twelvemonth let us now imagine some alteration to take place in the currency by which it is depreciated onehalf prices soon adjust themselves to the new circumstances and the annuity of the widow though nominally of the same amount will in reality purchase only half the quantity of the necessaries of life which it did before the workman who had placed his money in the savings' bank having perhaps purchased ten pounds' worth of materials and expended ten pounds in labour applied to them now finds himself by this alteration in the currency possessed nominally of eighty pounds but in reality of a sum which will purchase only half the labour and materials required to finish his machine; and he can neither complete it from want of capital nor dispose of what he has already done in its unfinished state for the price it has cost him in the meantime the other workman who had incurred a debt of a hundred pounds in order to complete the purchase of his calendering machine finds that the payments he receives for calendering have like all other prices doubled in consequence of the depreciation of the currency; and he has therefore in fact obtained his machine for one hundred and fifty pounds thus without any fault or imprudence and owing to circumstances over which they have no control the widow is reduced almost to starve; one workman is obliged to renounce for several years his hope of becoming a master; and another without any superior industry or skill but in fact from having made with reference to his circumstances rather an imprudent bargain finds himself unexpectedly relieved from half his debt and the possessor of a valuable source of profit; whilst the former owner of the machine if he also has invested the money arising from its sale in the savings' bank finds his property suddenly reduced onehalf  these evils to a greater or less extent attend every change in the value of the currency; and the importance of preserving it as far as possible unaltered in value cannot be too strongly impressed upon all classes of the community notes  in russia platinum has been employed for coin; and it possesses a peculiarity which deserves notice platinum cannot be melted in our furnaces and is chiefly valuable in commerce when in the shape of ingots from which it may be forged into useful forms but when a piece of platinum is cut into two parts it cannot easily be reunited except by means of a chemical process in which both parts are dissolved in an acid hence when platinum coin is too abundant it cannot like gold be reduced into masses by melting but must pass through an expensive process to render it useful  chapter  on the influence of verification on price  the money price of an article at any given period is usually stated to depend upon the proportion between the supply and the demand the average price of the same article during a long period is said to depend ultimately on the power of producing and selling it with the ordinary profits of capital but these principles although true in their general sense are yet so often modified by the influence of others that it becomes necessary to examine a little into the disturbing forces  with respect to the first of these propositions it may be observed that the cost of any article to the purchaser includes besides the ratio of the supply to the demand another element which though often of little importance is in many cases of great consequence the cost to the purchaser is the price he pays for any article added to the cost of verifying the fact of its having that degree of goodness for which he contracts in some cases the goodness of the article is evident on mere inspection and in those cases there is not much difference of price at different shops the goodness of loaf sugar for instance can be discerned almost at a glance; and the consequence is that the price is so uniform and the profit upon it so small that no grocer is at all anxious to sell it; whilst on the other hand tea of which it is exceedingly difficult to judge and which can be adulterated by mixture so as to deceive the skill even of a practised eye has a great variety of different prices and is that article which every grocer is most anxious to sell to his customers the difficulty and expense of verification are in some instances so great as to justify the deviation from wellestablished principles thus it is a general maxim that government can purchase any article at a cheaper rate than that at which they can manufacture it themselves but it has nevertheless been considered more economical to build extensive flourmills such are those at deptford and to grind their own corn than to verify each sack of purchased flour and to employ persons in devising methods of detecting the new modes of adulteration which might be continually resorted to  some years since a mode of preparing old clover and trefoil seeds by a process called doctoring became so prevalent as to excite the attention of the house of commons it appeared in evidence before a committee that the old seed of the white clover was doctored by first wetting it slightly and then drying it with the fumes of burning sulphur and that the red clover seed had its colour improved by shaking it in a sack with a small quantity of indigo; but this being detected after a time the doctors then used a preparation of logwood fined by a little copperas and sometimes by verdigris; thus at once improving the appearance of the old seed and diminishing if not destroying its vegetative power already enfeebled by age supposing no injury had resulted to good seed so prepared it was proved that from the improved appearance the market price would be enhanced by this process from five to twentyfive shillings a hundred weight but the greatest evil arose from the circumstance of these processes rendering old and worthless seed equal in appearance to the best one witness had tried some doctored seed and found that not above one grain in a hundred grew and that those which did vegetate died away afterwards; whilst about eighty or ninety per cent of good seed usually grows the seed so treated was sold to retail dealers in the country who of course endeavoured to purchase at the cheapest rate and from them it got into the hands of the farmers; neither of these classes being capable of distinguishing the fraudulent from the genuine seed many cultivators in consequence diminished their consumption of the article; and others were obliged to pay a higher price to those who had skill to distinguish the mixed seed and who had integrity and character to prevent them from dealing in it  in the irish flax trade a similar example of the high price paid for verification occurs it is stated in the report of the committee that the natural excellent quality of irish flax as contrasted with foreign or british has been admitted yet from the evidence before that committee it appears that irish flax sells in the market from d to d per pound less than other flax of equal or inferior quality part of this difference of price arises from negligence in its preparation but a part also from the expense of ascertaining that each parcel is free from useless matter to add to its weight this appears from the evidence of mr j corry who was during twentyseven years secretary to the irish linenboard the owners of the flax who are almost always people in the lower classes of life believe that they can best advance their own interests by imposing on the buyers flax being sold by weight various expedients are used to increase it; and every expedient is injurious particularly the damping of it; a very common practice which makes the flax afterwards heat the inside of every bundle and the bundles all vary in bulk is often full of pebbles or dirt of various kinds to increase the weight in this state it is purchased and exported to great britain the natural quality of irish flax is admitted to be not inferior to that produced by any foreign country; and yet the flax of every foreign country imported into great britain obtains a preference amongst the purchasers because the foreign flax is brought to the british market in a cleaner and more regular state the extent and value of the sales of foreign flax in great britain can be seen by reference to the public accounts; and i am induced to believe that ireland by an adequate extension of her flax tillage and having her flax markets brought under good regulations could without encroaching in the least degree upon the quantity necessary for her home consumption supply the whole of the demand of the british market to the exclusion of the foreigners  the lace trade affords other examples; and in enquiring into the complaints made to the house of commons by the framework knitters the committee observe that it is singular that the grievance most complained of one hundred and fifty years ago should in the present improved state of the trade be the same grievance which is now most complained of for it appears by the evidence given before your committee that all the witnesses attribute the decay of the trade more to the making of fraudulent and bad articles than to the war or to any other cause and it is shewn by the evidence that a kind of lace called singlepress was manufactured which although good to the eye became nearly spoiled in washing by the slipping of the threads; that not one person in a thousand could distinguish the difference between singlepress and doublepress lace; and that even workmen and manufacturers were obliged to employ a magnifying glass for that purpose; and that in another similar article called warp lace such aid was essential it was also stated by one witness that the trade had not yet ceased excepting in those places where the fraud had been discovered; and from those places no orders are now sent for any sort of nottingham lace the credit being totally ruined  in the stocking trade similar frauds have been practised it appeared in evidence that stockings were made of uniform width from the knee down to the ankle and being wetted and stretched on frames at the calf they retained their shape when dry but that the purchaser could not discover the fraud until after the first washing the stockings hung like bags about his ankles  in the watch trade the practice of deceit in forging the marks and names of respectable makers has been carried to a great extent both by natives and foreigners; and the effect upon our export trade has been most injurious as the following extract from the evidence before a committee of the house of commons will prove question how long have you been in the trade? answer nearly thirty years question the trade is at present much depressed? answer yes sadly question what is your opinion of the cause of that distress? answer i think it is owing to a number of watches that have been made so exceedingly bad that they will hardly look at them in the foreign markets; all with a handsome outside show and the works hardly fit for anything question do you mean to say that all the watches made in this country are of that description? answer no; only a number which are made up by some of the jews and other low manufacturers i recollect something of the sort years ago of a falloff of the east india work owing to there being a number of handsomelooking watches sent out for instance with hands on and figures as if they shewed seconds and had not any work regular to shew the seconds the hand went round but it was not regular question they had no perfect movements? answer no they had not; that was a long time since and we had not any east india work for a long time afterwards in the home market inferior but showy watches are made at a cheap rate which are not warranted by the maker to go above half an hour; about the time occupied by the jew pedlar in deluding his country customer  the practice in retail linendrapers' shops of calling certain articles yard wide when the real width is perhaps only seveneighths or threequarters arose at first from fraud which being detected custom was pleaded in its defence but the result is that the vender is constantly obliged to measure the width of his goods in the customer's presence in all these instances the object of the seller is to get a higher price than his goods would really produce if their quality were known; and the purchaser if not himself a skilful judge which rarely happens to be the case must pay some person in the shape of an additional money price who has skill to distinguish and integrity to furnish articles of the quality agreed on but as the confidence of persons in their own judgement is usually great large numbers will always flock to the cheap dealer who thus attracting many customers from the honest tradesman obliges him to charge a higher price for his judgement and character than without such competition he could afford to do  there are few things which the public are less able to judge of than the quality of drugs; and when these are compounded into medicines it is scarcely possible even for medical men to decide whether pure or adulterated ingredients have been employed this circumstance concurring with the present injudicious mode of paying for medical assistance has produced a curious effect on the price of medicines apothecaries instead of being paid for their services and skill are remunerated by being allowed to place a high charge upon their medicines which are confessedly of very small pecuniary value the effect of such a system is an inducement to prescribe more medicine than is necessary; and in fact even with the present charges the apothecary in ninetynine cases out of a hundred cannot be fairly remunerated unless the patient either takes or pays for more physic than he really requires the apparent extravagance of the charge of eighteen pence for a twoounce phial* of medicine is obvious to many who do not reflect on the fact that a great part of the charge is in reality payment for the exercise of professional skill as the same charge is made by the apothecary whether he attends the patient or merely prepares the prescription of a physician the chemist and druggist soon offered to furnish the same commodity at a greatly diminished price but the eighteen pence charged by the apothecary might have been fairly divided into two parts three pence for medicine and bottle and fifteen pence for attendance the chemist therefore who never attends his customers if he charges only a shilling for the same medicine realizes a profit of or per cent upon its value this enormous profit has called into existence a multitude of competitors; and in this instance the impossibility of verifying has in a great measure counteracted the beneficial effects of competition the general adulteration of drugs even at the extremely high price at which they are retailed as medicine enables those who are supposed to sell them in an unadulterated state to make large profits whilst the same evil frequently disappoints the expectation and defeats the skill of the most eminent physician it is difficult to point out a remedy for this evil without suggesting an almost total change in the system of medical practice if the apothecary were to charge for his visits and to reduce his medicines to onefourth or onefifth of their present price he would still have an interest in procuring the best drugs for the sake of his own reputation or skill or if the medical attendant who is paid more highly for his time were to have several pupils he might himself supply the medicines without a specific charge and his pupils would derive improvement from compounding them as well as from examining the purity of the drugs he would purchase the public would gain several advantages by this arrangement in the first place it would be greatly for the interest of the medical practitioner to have the best drugs; it would be in his interest also not to give more physic than needful; and it would enable him through some of his more advanced pupils to watch more frequently the changes of any malady  there are many articles of hardware which it is impossible for the purchaser to verify at the time of purchase or even afterwards without defacing them plated harness and coach furniture may be adduced as examples these are usually of wrought iron covered with silver owing their strength to the one and a certain degree of permanent beauty to the other metal both qualities are occasionally much impaired by substituting cast for wroughtiron and by plating with soft solder tin and lead instead of with hard solder silver and brass the loss of strength is the greatest evil in this case; for cast iron though made for this purpose more tough than usual by careful annealing is still much weaker than wroughtiron and serious accidents often arise from harness giving way in plating with soft solder a very thin plate of silver is made to cover the iron but it is easily detached particularly by a low degree of heat hard soldering gives a better coat of silver which is very firmly attached and is not easily injured unless by a very high degree of heat the inferior can be made to look nearly as well as the better article and the purchaser can scarcely discover the difference without cutting into it  the principle that price at any moment is dependent on the relation of the supply to the demand is true to the full extent only when the whole supply is in the hands of a very large number of small holders and the demand is caused by the wants of another set of persons each of whom requires only a very small quantity and the reason appears to be that it is only in such circumstances that a uniform average can be struck between the feelings the passions the prejudices the opinions and the knowledge of both parties if the supply or present stock in hand be entirely in the possession of one person he will naturally endeavour to put such a price upon it as shall produce by its sale the greatest quantity of money; but he will be guided in this estimate of the price at which he will sell both by the knowledge that increased price will cause a diminished consumption and by the desire to realize his profit before a new supply shall reach the market from some other quarter if however the same stock is in the hands of several dealers there will be an immediate competition between them arising partly from their different views of the duration of the present state of supply and partly from their own peculiar circumstances with respect to the employment of their capital  the expense of ascertaining that the price charged is that which is legally due is sometimes considerable the inconvenience which this verification produces in the case of parcels sent by coaches is very great the time lost in recovering an overcharge generally amounts to so many times the value of the sum recovered that it is but rarely resorted to it seems worthy of consideration whether it would not be a convenience to the public if government were to undertake the general conveyance of parcels somewhat on the same system with that on which the post is now conducted the certainty of their delivery and the absence of all attempt at overcharge would render the prohibition of rival carriers unnecessary perhaps an experiment might be made on this subject by enlarging the weight allowed to be sent by the twopenny post and by conveying works in sheets by the general post this latter suggestion would be of great importance to literature and consequently to the circulation of knowledge as the postoffice regulations stand at present it constantly happens that persons who have an extensive reputation for science receive by post from foreign countries works or parts of works for which they are obliged to pay a most extravagant rate of postage or else refuse to take in some interesting communication in france and germany printed sheets of paper are forwarded by post at a very moderate expense and it is fit that the science and literature of england should be equally favoured  it is important if possible always to connect the name of the workman with the work he has executed this secures for him the credit or the blame he may justly deserve; and diminishes in some cases the necessity of verification the extent to which this is carried in literary works published in america is remarkable in the translation of the mecanique celeste by mr bowditch not merely the name of the printer but also those of the compositors are mentioned in the work  again if the commodity itself is of a perishable nature such for example as a cargo of ice imported into the port of london from norway a few summers since then time will supply the place of competition; and whether the article is in the possession of one or of many persons it will scarcely reach a monopoly price the history of cajeput oil during the last few months offers a curious illustration of the effect of opinion upon price in july of last year cajeput oil was sold exclusive of duty at d per ounce the disease which had ravaged the east was then supposed to be approaching our shores and its proximity created alarm at this period the oil in question began to be much talked of as a powerful remedy in that dreadful disorder; and in september it rose to the price of s and s the ounce in october there were few or no sales but in the early part of november the speculations in this substance reached their height and between the st and the th it realized the following prices s d s s d s d s s s s d s after november the holders of cajeput oil were anxious to sell at much lower rates; and in december a fresh arrival was offered by public sale at s and withdrawn being sold afterwards as it was understood by private contract at s or s d per oz since that time s d and s have been realized; and a fresh arrival which is daily expected march will probably reduce it below the price of july now it is important to notice that in november the time of greatest speculation the quantity in the market was held by few persons and that it frequently changed hands each holder being desirous to realize his profit the quantity imported since that time has also been considerable*  the effect of the equalization of price by an increased number of dealers may be observed in the price of the various securities sold at the stock exchange the number of persons who deal in the per cent stock being large any one desirous of selling can always dispose of his stock at oneeighth per cent under the market price; but those who wish to dispose of bank stock or of any other securities of more limited circulation are obliged to make a sacrifice of eight or ten times this amount upon each hundred pounds value  the frequent speculations in oil tallow and other commodities which must occur to the memory of most of my readers were always founded on the principle of purchasing up all the stock on hand and agreeing for the purchase of the expected arrivals; thus proving the opinion of capitalists to be that a larger average price may be procured by the stock being held by few persons notes  apothecaries frequently purchase these phials at the old bottle warehouses at ten shillings per gross; so that when their servant has washed them the cost of the phial is nearly one penny  i have understood that the price of camphor at the same time suffered similar changes  chapter  on the influence of durability on price  having now considered the circumstances that modify what may be called the momentary amount of price we must next examine a principle which seems to have an effect on its permanent average the durability of any commodity influences its cost in a permanent manner we have already stated that what may be called the momentary price of any commodity depends upon the proportion existing between the supply and demand and also upon the cost of verification the average price during a long period will depend upon the labour required for producing and bringing it to market as well as upon the average supply and demand; but it will also be influenced by the durability of the article manufactured many things in common use are substantially consumed in using a phosphorus match articles of food and a cigar are examples of this description some things after use become inapplicable to their former purposes as paper which has been printed upon but it is yet available for the cheesemonger or the trunkmaker some articles as pens are quickly worn out by use; and some are still valuable after a long continued wear there are others few perhaps in number which never wear out; the harder precious stones when well cut and polished are of this later class the fashion of the gold or silver mounting in which they are set may vary with the taste of the age and such ornaments are constantly exposed for sale as secondhand but the gems themselves when removed from their supports are never so considered a brilliant which has successively graced the necks of a hundred beauties or glittered for a century upon patrician brows is weighed by the diamond merchant in the same scale with another which has just escaped from the wheel of the lapidary and will be purchased or sold by him at the same price per carat the great mass of commodities is intermediate in its character between these two extremes and the periods of respective duration are very various it is evident that the average price of those things which are consumed in the act of using them can never be less than that of the labour of bringing them to market they may for a short time be sold for less but under such circumstances their production must soon cease altogether on the other hand if an article never wears out its price may continue permanently below the cost of the labour expended in producing it; and the only consequence will be that no further production will take place its price will continue to be regulated by the relation of the supply to the demand; and should that at any aftertime rise for a considerable period above the cost of production it will be again produced  articles become old from actual decay or the wearing out of their parts; from improved modes of constructing them; or from changes in their form and fashion required by the varying taste of the age in the two latter cases their utility is but little diminished; and being less sought after by those who have hitherto employed them they are sold at a reduced price to a class of society rather below that of their former possessors many articles of furniture such as wellmade tables and chairs are thus found in the rooms of those who would have been quite unable to have purchased them when new; and we find constantly even in the houses of the more opulent large lookingglasses which have passed successively through the hands of several possessors changing only the fashion of their frames; and in some instances even this alteration is omitted an additional coat of gilding saving them from the character of being secondhand thus a taste for luxuries is propagated downwards in society' and after a short period the numbers who have acquired new wants become sufficient to excite the ingenuity of the manufacturer to reduce the cost of supplying them whilst he is himself benefited by the extended scale of demand  there is a peculiarity in lookingglasses with reference to the principle just mentioned the most frequent occasion of injury to them arises from accidental violence; and the peculiarity is that unlike most other articles when broken they are still of some value if a large mirror is accidentally cracked it is immediately cut into two or more smaller ones each of which may be perfect if the degree of violence is so great as to break it into many fragments these smaller pieces may be cut into squares for dressingglasses; and if the silvering is injured it can either be resilvered or used as plateglass for glazing windows the addition from our manufactories to the stock of plateglass in the country is annually about two hundred and fifty thousand square feet it would be very difficult to estimate the quantity annually destroyed or exported but it is probably small; and the effect of these continual additions is seen in the diminished price and increased consumption of the article almost all the better order of shop fronts are now glazed with it if it were quite indestructible the price would continually diminish; and unless an increased demand arose from new uses or from a greater number of customers a single manufactory unchecked by competition would ultimately be compelled to shut up driven out of the market by the permanance of its own productions  the metals are in some degree permanent although several of them are employed in such forms that they are ultimately lost copper is a metal of which a great proportion returns to use a part of that employed in sheathing ships and covering houses is lost from corrosion; but the rest is generally remelted some is lost in small brass articles and some is consumed in the formation of salts roman vitriol sulphate of copper verdigris acetate of copper and verditer gold is wasted in gilding and in embroidering; but a portion of this is recovered by burning the old articles some portion is lost by the wear of gold but upon the whole it possesses considerable permanence iron a proportion of this metal is wasted by oxidation in small nails in fine wire; by the wear of tools and of the tire of wheels and by the formation of some dyes but much both of cast and of wroughtiron returns to use lead is wasted in great quantities some portion of that which is used in pipes and in sheets for covering roofs returns to the meltingpot; but large quantities are consumed in the form of small shot or sometimes in that of musket balls litharge and red lead for white and red paints for glassmaking for glazing pottery and for sugar of lead acetate of lead silver is rather a permanent metal some portion is consumed in the wear of coin in that of silver plate and a portion in silvering and embroidering tin the chief waste of this metal arises from tinned iron; some is lost in solder and in solutions for the dyers  chapter  of price as measured by money  the money price at which an article sells furnishes us with comparatively little information respecting its value if we compare distant intervals of time and different countries; for gold and silver in which price is usually measured are themselves subject like all other commodities to changes in value; nor is there any standard to which these variations can be referred the average price of a certain quality of different manufactured articles or of raw produce has been suggested as a standard; but a new difficulty then presents itself; for the improved methods of producing such articles render their money price extremely variable within very limited periods the annexed table will afford a striking instance of this kind of change within a period of only twelve years  prices of the following articles at birmingham in the undermentioned years  description s d s d s d s d anvils cwt   awls polished liverpool

and factors in all our manufacturing and commercial towns to the great importance both for their own interests and for that of the population to which their capital gives employment of collecting with care such averages from the actual sales registered in their books nor perhaps would it be without its use to suggest that such averages would be still more valuable if collected from as many different quarters as possible; that the quantity of the goods from which they are deduced together with the greatest deviations from the mean ought to be given; and that if a small committee were to undertake the task it would give great additional weight to the information political economists have been reproached with too small a use of facts and too large an employment of theory if facts are wanting let it be remembered that the closetphilosopher is unfortunately too little acquainted with the admirable arrangements of the factory and that no class of persons can supply so readily and with so little sacrifice of time the data on which all the reasonings of political economists are founded as the merchant and manufacturer; and unquestionably to no class are the deductions to which they give rise so important nor let it be feared that erroneous deductions may be made from such recorded facts the errors which arise from the absence of facts are far more numerous and more durable than those which result from unsound reasoning respecting true data  the great diminution in price of the articles here enumerated may have arisen from several causes the alteration in the value of the currency the increased value of gold in consequence of the increased demand for coin the first of these causes may have had some influence and the second may have had a very small effect upon the two first quotations of prices but none at all upon the two latter ones the diminished rate of profit produced by capital however employed this may be estimated by the average price of three per cents at the periods stated the diminished price of the raw materials out of which these articles were manufactured the raw material is principally brass and iron and the reduction upon it may in some measure be estimated by the diminished price of iron and brass wire in the cost of which articles the labour bears a less proportion than it does in many of the others the smaller quantity of raw material employed and perhaps in some instances an inferior quality of workmanship the improved means by which the same effect was produced by diminished labour  in order to afford the means of estimating the influence of these several causes the following table is subjoined   average price of l s d l s d l s d l s d l s d l s d gold per oz    value of currency per cent  price of per cent

unaccompanied by any explanation might possibly lead to erroneous conclusions i subjoin the following observations for which i am indebted to the kindness of mr tooke who may yet i hope be induced to continue his valuable work on high and low prices through the important period which has elapsed since its publication 'the table commences with and exhibits a great falling off in the price of wheat and iron coincidently with a fall in the price of gold and leading to the inference of cause and effect now as regards wheat it so happened that in it reached its highest price in consequence of a series of bad harvests when relief by importation was difficult and enormously expensive in december whilst the price of gold had risen to l the price of wheat had fallen to s or per cent under what it had been in the spring of ; proving clearly that the two articles were under the influence of opposite causes 'again in the freight and insurance on swedish iron were so much higher than at present as to account for nearly the whole of the difference of price and in there had been an extensive speculation which had raised the price of all iron so that a part of the subsequent decline was a mere reaction from a previously unfounded elevation more recently in there was a great speculative rise in the article which served as a strong stimulus to increased production this aided by improved power of machinery has proceeded to such an extent as fully to account for the fall of price' to these reflections i will only add that the result of my own observation leads me to believe that by far the most influential of these causes has been the invention of cheaper modes of manufacturing the extent to which this can be carried while a profit can yet be realized at the reduced price is truly astonishing as the following fact which rests on good authority will prove twenty years since a brass knob for the locks of doors was made at birmingham; the price at that time being s d per dozen the same article is now manufactured having the same weight of metal and an equal or in fact a slightly superior finish at s d per dozen one circumstance which has produced this economy in the manufacture is that the lathe on which these knobs are finished is now turned by a steamengine; so that the workman relieved from that labour can make them twenty times as fast as he did formerly  the difference

wish to compare the value of any article at different periods of time it is clear that neither any one substance nor even the combination of all manufactured goods can furnish us with an invariable unit by which to form our scale of estimation mr malthus has proposed for this purpose to consider a day's labour of an agricultural labourer as the unit to which all value should be referred thus if we wish to compare the value of twenty yards of broad cloth in saxony at the present time with that of the same kind and quantity of cloth fabricated in england two centuries ago we must find the number of days' labour the cloth would have purchased in england at the time mentioned and compare it with the number of days' labour which the same quantity of cloth will now purchase in saxony agricultural labour appears to have been selected because it exists in all countries and employs a large number of persons and also because it requires a very small degree of previous instruction it seems in fact to be merely the exertion of a man's physical force; and its value above that of a machine of equal power arises from its portability and from the facility of directing its efforts to arbitrary and continually fluctuating purposes it may perhaps be worthy of enquiry whether a more constant average might not be deduced from combining with this species of labour those trades which require but a moderate exertion of skill and which likewise exist in all civilized countries such as those of the blacksmith and carpenter etc* in all such comparisons there is however another element which though not essentially necessary will yet add much to our means of judging it is an estimate of the quantity of that food on which the labourer usually subsists which is necessary for his daily support compared with the quantity which his daily wages will purchase  the existence of a class of middlemen between small producers and merchants is frequently advantageous to both parties; and there are certain periods in the history of several manufactures which naturally call that class of traders into existence there are also times when the advantage ceasing the custom of employing them also terminates; the middlemen especially when numerous as they sometimes are in retail trades enhancing the price without equivalent good thus in the recent examination by the house of commons into the state of the coal trade it appears that fivesixths of the london public is supplied by a class of middlemen who are called in the trade brass plate coal merchants these consist principally of merchants' clerks gentlemen's servants and others who have no wharfs of their own but merely give their orders to some true coal merchant who sends in the coals from his wharf the brass plate coal merchants of course receiving a commission for his agency  in italy this system is carried to a great extent amongst the voituriers or persons who undertake to convey travellers there are some possessed of greater fluency and a more persuasive manner who frequent the inns where the english resort and who as soon as they have made a bargain for the conveyance of a traveller go out amongst their countrymen and procure some other voiturier to do the job for a considerably smaller sum themselves pocketing the difference a short time before the day of starting the contractor appears before his customer in great distress regretting his inability to perform the journey on account of the dangerous illness of a mother or some relative and requesting to have his cousin or brother substituted for him the english traveller rarely fails to acquiesce in this change and often praises the filial piety of the rogue who has deceived him notes  much information for such an enquiry is to be found for the particular period to which it refers in the report of the committee of the house of commons on manufacturers' employment july chapter  of raw materials  although the cost of any article may be reduced in its ultimate analysis to the quantity of labour by which it was produced; yet it is usual in a certain state of the manufacture of most substances to call them by the term raw material thus iron when reduced from the ore and rendered malleable is in a state fitted for application to a multitude of useful purposes and is the raw material out of which most of our tools are made in this stage of its manufacture but a moderate quantity of labour has been expended on the substance; and it becomes an interesting subject to trace the various proportions in which raw material in this sense of the term and labour unite to constitute the value of many of the productions of the arts  gold leaf consists of a portion of the metal beaten out to so great a degree of thinness as to allow a greenishblue light to be transmitted through its pores about square inches of this are sold in the form of a small book containing leaves of gold for s d in this case the raw material or gold is worth rather less than twothirds of the manufactured article in the case of silver leaf the labour considerably exceeds the value of the material a book of fifty leaves which would cover above square inches is sold for s d  we may trace the relative influence of the two causes above referred to in the prices of fine gold chains made at venice the sizes of these chains are known by numbers the smallest having been in no and the numbers  etc progressively increasing in size the following table shews the numbers and the prices of those made at that time* the first column gives the number by which the chain is known; the second expresses the weight in grains of one inch in length of each chain; the third column the number of links in the same length; and the last expresses the price in francs worth tenpence each of a venetian braccio or about two english feet of each chain  venetian gold chains price of a venetian braccio equal to weight of number of links two feet inch no one inch in grains in one inch english  to  francs           amongst these chains that numbered and that numbered are exactly of the same price although the quantity of gold in the latter is twentytwo times as much as in the former the difficulty of making the smallest chain is so great that the women who make it cannot work above two hours at a time as we advance from the smaller chain the proportionate value of the work to the worth of the material becomes less and less until at the numbers and these two elements of cost balance each other after which the difficulty of the work decreases and the value of the material increases  the quantity of labour expended on these chains is however incomparably less than that which is applied in some of the manufactures of iron in the case of the smallest venetian chain the value of the labour is not above thirty times that of the gold the pendulum spring of a watch which governs the vibrations of the balance costs at the retail price two pence and weighs fifteen onehundredths of a grain whilst the retail price of a pound of the best iron the raw material out of which fifty thousand such springs are made is exactly the same sum of two pence  the

depends is the division of labour amongst the persons who perform the work the first application of this principle must have been made in a very early stage of society for it must soon have been apparent that a larger number of comforts and conveniences could be acquired by each individual if one man restricted his occupation to the art of making bows another to that of building houses a third boats and so on this division of labour into trades was not however the result of an opinion that the general riches of the community would be increased by such an arrangement; but it must have arisen from the circumstance of each individual so employed discovering that he himself could thus make a greater profit of his labour than by pursuing more varied occupations society must have made considerable advances before this principle could have been carried into the workshop; for it is only in countries which have attained a high degree of civilization and in articles in which there is a great competition amongst the producers that the most perfect system of the division of labour is to be observed the various principles on which the advantages of this system depend have been much the subject of discussion amongst writers on political economy; but the relative importance of their influence does not appear in all cases to have been estimated with sufficient precision it is my intention in the first instance to state shortly those principles and then to point out what appears to me to have been omitted by those who have previously treated the subject  of the time required for learning it will readily be admitted that the portion of time occupied in the acquisition of any art will depend on the difficulty of its execution; and that the greater the number of distinct processes the longer will be the time which the apprentice must employ in acquiring it five or seven years have been adopted in a great many trades as the time considered requisite for a lad to acquire a sufficient knowledge of his art and to enable him to repay by his labour during the latter portion of his time the expense incurred by his master at its commencement if however instead of learning all the different processes for making a needle for instance his attention be confined to one operation the portion of time consumed unprofitably at the commencement of his apprenticeship will be small and all the rest of it will be beneficial to his master and consequently if there be any competition amongst the masters the apprentice will be able to make better terms and diminish the period of his servitude again the facility of acquiring skill in a single process and the early period of life at which it can be made a source of profit will induce a greater number of parents to bring up their children to it; and from this circumstance also the number of workmen being increased the wages will soon fall  of waste of materials in learning a certain quantity of material will in all cases be consumed unprofitably or spoiled by every person who learns an art; and as he applies himself to each new process he will waste some of the raw material or of the partly manufactured commodity but if each man commit this waste in acquiring successively every process the quantity of waste will be much greater than if each person confine his attention to one process; in this view of the subject therefore the division of labour will diminish the price of production  another advantage resulting from the division of labour is the saving of that portion of time which is always lost in changing from one occupation to another when the human hand or the human head has been for some time occupied in any kind of work it cannot instantly change its employment with full effect the muscles of the limbs employed have acquired a flexibility during their exertion and those not in action a stiffness during rest which renders every change slow and unequal in the commencement long habit also produces in the muscles exercised a capacity for enduring fatigue to a much greater degree than they could support under other circumstances a similar result seems to take place in any change of mental exertion; the attention bestowed on the new subject not being so perfect at first as it becomes after some exercise  change of tools the employment of different tools in the successive processes is another cause of the loss of time in changing from one operation to another if these tools are simple and the change is not frequent the loss of time is not considerable; but in many processes of the arts the tools are of great delicacy requiring accurate adjustment every time they are used; and in many cases the time employed in adjusting bears a large proportion to that employed in using the tool the slidingrest the dividing and the drillingengine are of this kind; and hence in manufactories of sufficient extent it is found to be good economy to keep one machine constantly employed in one kind of work one lathe for example having a screw motion to its slidingrest along the whole length of its bed is kept constantly making cylinders; another having a motion for equalizing the velocity of the work at the point at which it passes the tool is kept for facing surfaces; whilst a third is constantly employed in cutting wheels  skill acquired by frequent repetition of the same processes the constant repetition of the same process necessarily produces in the workman a degree of excellence and rapidity in his particular department which is never possessed by a person who is obliged to execute many different processes this rapidity is still further increased from the circumstance that most of the operations in factories where the division of labour is carried to a considerable extent are paid for as piecework it is difficult to estimate in numbers the effect of this cause upon production in nailmaking adam smith has stated that it is almost three to one; for he observes that a smith accustomed to make nails but whose whole business has not been that of a nailer can make only from eight hundred to a thousand per day; whilst a lad who had never exercised any other trade can make upwards of two thousand three hundred a day  in different trades the economy of production arising from the lastmentioned cause will necessarily be different the case of nailmaking is perhaps rather an extreme one it must however be observed that in one sense this is not a permanent source of advantage; for though it acts at the commencement of an establishment yet every month adds to the skill of the workmen; and at the end of three or four years they will not be very far behind those who have never practised any other branch of their art upon an occasion when a large issue of banknotes was required a clerk at the bank of england signed his name consisting of seven letters including the initial of his christian name five thousand three hundred times during eleven working hours besides arranging the notes he had signed in parcels of fifty each  the division of labour suggests the contrivance of tools and machinery to execute its processes when each processes by which any article is produced is the sole occupation of one individual his whole attention being devoted to a very limited and simple operation improvements in the form of his tools or in the mode of using them are much more likely to occur to his mind than if it were distracted by a greater variety of circumstances such an improvement in the tool is generally the first step towards a machine if a piece of metal is to be cut in a lathe for example there is one particular angle at which the cuttingtool must be held to insure the cleanest cut; and it is quite natural that the idea of fixing the tool at that angle should present itself to an intelligent workman the necessity of moving the tool slowly and in a direction parallel to itself would suggest the use of a screw and thus arises the slidingrest it was probably the idea of mounting a chisel in a frame to prevent its cutting too deeply which gave rise to the common carpenter's plane in cases where a blow from a hammer is employed experience teaches the proper force required the transition from the hammer held in the hand to one mounted upon an axis and lifted regularly to a certain height by some mechanical contrivance requires perhaps a greater degree of invention than those just instanced; yet it is not difficult to perceive that if the hammer always falls from the same height its effect must be always the same  when each process has been reduced to the use of some simple tool the union of all these tools actuated by one moving power constitutes a machine in contriving tools and simplifying processes the operative workmen are perhaps most successful; but it requires far other habits to combine into one machine these scattered arts a previous education as a workman in the peculiar trade is undoubtedly a valuable preliminary; but in order to make such combinations with any reasonable expectation of success an extensive knowledge of machinery and the power of making mechanical drawings are essentially requisite these accomplishments are now much more common than they were formerly and their absence was perhaps one of the causes of the multitude of failures in the early history of many of our manufactures  such are the principles usually assigned as the causes of the advantage resulting from the division of labour as in the view i have taken of the question the most important and influential cause has been altogether unnoticed i shall restate those principles in the words of adam smith the great increase in the quantity of work which in consequence of the division of labour the same number of people are capable of performing is owing to three different circumstances first to the increase of dexterity in every particular workman; secondly to the saving of time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another; and lastly to the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour and enable one man to do the work of many now although all these are important causes and each has its influence on the result; yet it appears to me that any explanation of the cheapness of manufactured articles as consequent upon the division of labour would be incomplete if the following principle were omitted to be stated that the master manufacturer by dividing the work to be executed into different processes each requiring different degrees of skill or of force can purchase exactly that precise quantity of both which is necessary for each process; whereas if the whole work were executed by one workman that person must possess sufficient skill to perform the most difficult and sufficient strength to execute the most laborious of the operations into which the art is divided*  as the clear apprehension of this principle upon which a great part of the economy arising from the division of labour depends is of considerable importance it may be desirable to point out its precise and numerical application in some specific manufacture the art of making needles is perhaps that which i should have selected for this illustration as comprehending a very large number of processes remarkably different in their nature; but the less difficult art of pinmaking has some claim to attention from its having been used by adam smith; and i am confirmed in the choice of it by the circumstance of our possessing a very accurate and minute description of that art as practised in france above half a century ago  pinmaking in the manufacture of pins in england the following processes are employed  wiredrawing a the brass wire used for making pins is purchased by the manufacturer in coils of about twentytwo inches in diameter each weighing about thirtysix pounds b the coils are wound off into smaller ones of about six inches in diameter and between one and two pounds' weight c the diameter of this wire is now reduced by drawing it repeatedly through holes in steel plates until it becomes of the size required for the sort of pins intended to be made during this process the wire is hardened and to prevent its breaking it must be annealed two or three times according to the diminution of diameter required d the coils are then soaked in sulphuric acid largely diluted with water in order to clean them and are then beaten on stone for the purpose of removing any oxidated coating which may adhere to them these operations are usually performed by men who draw and clean from thirty to thirtysix pounds of wire a day they are paid at the rate of five farthings per pound and generally earn about s d per day m perronnet made some experiments on the extension the wire undergoes in passing through each hole he took a piece of thick swedish brass wire and found  feet inches its length to be before drawing  after passing the first hole  second hole  third hole it was now annealed and the length became  after passing the fourth hole  fifth hole  sixth hole  and finally after passing through six other holes the holes through which the wire was drawn were not in this experiment of regularly decreasing diameter it is extremely difficult to make such holes and still more to preserve them in their original dimensions  straightening the wire the coil of wire now passes into the hands of a woman assisted by a boy or girl a few nails or iron pins not quite in a line are fixed into one end of a wooden table about twenty feet in length; the end of the wire is passed alternately between these nails and is then pulled to the other end of the table the object of this process is to straighten the wire which had acquired a considerable curvature in the small coils in which it had been wound the length thus straightened is cut off and the remainder of the coil is drawn into similar lengths about seven nails or pins are employed in straightening the wire and their adjustment is a matter of some nicety it seems that by passing the wire between the first three nails or pins a bend is produced in an opposite direction to that which the wire had in the coil; this bend by passing the next two nails is reduced to another less curved in the first direction and so on till the curve of the wire may at last be confounded with a straight line  pointing a a man next takes about three hundred of these straightened pieces in a parcel and putting them into a gauge cuts off from one end by means of a pair of shears moved by his foot a portion equal in length to rather more than six pins he continues this operation until the entire parcel is reduced into similar pieces b the next step is to sharpen the ends for this purpose the operator sits before a steel mill which is kept rapidly revolving it consists of a cylinder about six inches in diameter and two and a half inches broad faced with steel which is cut in the manner of a file another cylinder is fixed on the same axis at a few inches distant; the file on the edge of which is of a finer kind and is used for finishing off the points the workman now takes up a parcel of the wires between the finger and thumb of each hand and presses the ends obliquely on the mill taking care with his fingers and thumbs to make each wire slowly revolve upon its axis having thus pointed all the pieces at one end he reverses them and performs the same operation on the other this process requires considerable skill but it is not unhealthy; whilst the similar process in needlemaking is remarkably destructive of health c the pieces now pointed at both ends are next placed in gauges and the pointed ends are cut off by means of shears to the proper length of which the pins are to be made the remaining portions of the wire are now equal to about four pins in length and are again pointed at each end and their lengths again cut off this process is repeated a third time and the small portion of wire left in the middle is thrown amongst the waste to be melted along with the dust arising from the sharpening it is usual for a man his wife and a child to join in performing these processes; and they are paid at the rate of five farthings per pound they can point from thirtyfour to thirtysix and a half pounds per day and gain from s d to s which may be apportioned thus; s d the man s the woman d to the boy or girl  twisting and cutting the heads the next process is making the heads for this purpose a a boy takes a piece of wire of the same diameter as the pin to be headed which he fixes on an axis that can be made to revolve rapidly by means of a wheel and strap connected with it this wire is called the mould he then takes a smaller wire which having passed through an eye in a small tool held in his left hand he fixes close to the bottom of the mould the mould is now made to revolve rapidly by means of the right hand and the smaller wire coils round it until it has covered the whole length of the mould the boy now cuts the end of the spiral connected with the foot of the mould and draws it off b when a sufficient quantity of heading is thus made a man takes from thirteen to twenty of these spirals in his left hand between his thumb and three outer fingers these he places in such a manner that two turns of the spiral shall be beyond the upper edge of a pair of shears and with the forefinger of the same hand he feels that only two turns do so project with his right hand he closes the shears; and the two turns of the spiral being cut off drop into a basin; the position of the forefinger preventing the heads from flying about when cut off the workmen who cut the heads are usually paid at the rate of d to d per pound for large heads but a higher price is given for the smaller heading out of this they pay the boy who spins the spiral; he receives from d to d a day a good workman can cut from six to about thirty pounds of heading per day according to its size  heading the process of fixing the head on the body of the pin is usually executed by women and children each operator sits before a small steel stake having a cavity into which one half of the intended head will fit; immediately above is a steel die having a corresponding cavity for the other half of the head this latter die can be raised by a pedal moved by the foot the weight of the hammer is from seven to ten pounds and it falls through a very small space perhaps from one to two inches the cavities in the centre of these dies are connected with the edge of a small groove to admit of the body of the pin which is thus prevented from being flattened by the blow of the die a the operator with his left hand dips the pointed end of the body of a pin into a tray of heads; having passed the point through one of them he carries it along to the other end with the forefinger he now takes the pin in the right hand and places the head in the cavity of the stake and lifting the die with his foot allows it to fall on the head this blow tightens the head on the shank which is then turned round and the head receives three or four blows on different parts of its circumference the women and children who fix the heads are paid at the rate of s d for every twenty thousand a skilful operator can with great exertion do twenty thousand per day but from ten to fifteen thousand is the usual quantity children head a much smaller number varying of course with the degree of their skill about one per cent of the pins are spoiled in the process; these are picked out afterwards by women and are reserved along with the waste from other processes for the meltingpot the die in which the heads are struck is varied in form according to the fashion of the time; but the repeated blows to which it is subject render it necessary that it should be repaired after it has been used for about thirty pounds of pins  tinning the pins are now fit to be tinned a process which is usually executed by a man assisted by his wife or by a lad the quantity of pins operated upon at this stage is usually fiftysix pounds a they are first placed in a pickle in order to remove any grease or dirt from their surface and also to render them rough which facilitates the adherence of the tin with which they are to be covered b they are then placed in a boiler full of a solution of tartar in water in which they are mixed with a quantity of tin in small grains in this they are generally kept boiling for about two hours and a half and are then removed into a tub of water into which some bran has been thrown for the purpose of washing off the acid liquor c they are then taken out and being placed in wooden trays are well shaken in dry bran this removes any water adhering to them; and by giving the wooden tray a peculiar kind of motion the pins are thrown up and the bran gradually flies off and leaves them behind in the tray the man who pickles and tins the pins usually gets one penny per pound for the work and employs himself during the boiling of one batch of pins in drying those previously tinned he can earn about s per day; but out of this he pays about s for his assistant  papering the pins come from the tinner in wooden bowls with the points projecting in all directions the arranging of them side by side in paper is generally performed by women a a woman takes up some and places them on a comb and shaking them some of the pins fall back into the bowl and the rest being caught by their heads are detained between the teeth of the comb b having thus arranged them in a parallel direction she fixes the requisite number between two pieces of iron having twentyfive small grooves at equal distances; c and having previously doubled the paper she presses it against the points of the pins until they have passed through the two folds which are to retain them the pins are then relieved from the grasp of the tool and the process is repeated a woman gains about s d per day by papering; but children are sometimes employed who earn from d per day and upwards  having thus generally described the various processes of pinmaking and having stated the usual cost of each it will be convenient to present a tabular view of the time occupied by each process and its cost as well as the sums which can be earned by the persons who confine themselves solely to each process as the rate of wages is itself fluctuating and as the prices paid and quantities executed have been given only between certain limits it is not to be expected that this table can represent the cost of each part of the work with the minutest accuracy nor even that it shall accord perfectly with the prices above given but it has been drawn up with some care and will be quite sufficient to serve as the basis of those reasonings which it is meant to illustrate a table nearly similar will be subjoined which has been deduced from a statement of m

wheel appears to have arisen from the person so occupied being unemployed during half his time whilst the pointer went to another manufactory  it appears from the analysis we have given of the art of pinmaking that it occupies rather more than seven hours and a half of time for ten different individuals working in succession on the same material to convert it into a pound of pins; and that the total expense of their labour each being paid in the joint ratio of his skill and of the time he is employed amounts very nearly to s d but from an examination of the first of these tables it appears that the wages earned by the persons employed vary from d per day up to s and consequently the skill which is required for their respective employments may be measured by those sums now it is evident that if one person were required to make the whole pound of pins he must have skill enough to earn about s d per day whilst he is pointing the wires or cutting off the heads from the spiral coilsand s when he is whitening the pins; which three operations together would occupy little more than the seventeenth part of his time it is also apparent that during more than one half of his time he must be earning only s d per day in putting on the heads; although his skill if properly employed would in the same time produce nearly five times as much if therefore we were to employ for all the processes the man who whitens the pins and who earns s per day even supposing that he could make the pound of pins in an equally short time yet we must pay him for his time  pence or about s d the pins would therefore cost in making three times and three quarters as much as they now do by the application of the division of labour the higher the skill required of the workman in any one process of a manufacture and the smaller the time during which it is employed so much the greater will be the advantage of separating that process from the rest and devoting one person's attention entirely to it had we selected the art of needlemaking as our illustration the economy arising from the division of labour would have been still more striking; for the process of tempering the needles requires great skill attention and experience and although from three to four thousand are tempered at once the workman is paid a very high rate of wages in another process of the same manufacture drypointing which also is executed with great rapidity the wages earned by the workman reach from s to s s and even in some instances to s per day; whilst other processes are carried on by children paid at the rate of d per day  some further reflections suggested by the preceding analysis will be reserved until we have placed before the reader a brief description of a machine for making pins invented by an american it is highly ingenious in point of contrivance and in respect to its economical principles will furnish a strong and interesting contrast with the manufacture of pins by the human hand in this machine a coil of brass wire is placed on an axis; one end of this wire is drawn by a pair of rollers through a small hole in a plate of steel and is held there by a forceps as soon as the machine is put in action  the forceps draws the wire on to a distance equal in length to one pin a cutting edge of steel then descends close to the hole through which the wire entered and severs the piece drawn out  the forceps holding the piece thus separated moves on till it brings the wire to the centre of the chuck of a small lathe which opens to receive it whilst the forceps is returning to fetch another piece of wire the lathe revolves rapidly and grinds the projecting end of the wire upon a steel mill which advances towards it  after this first or coarse pointing the lathe stops and another forceps takes hold of the halfpointed pin which is instantly released by the opening of the chuck and conveys it to a similar chuck of an adjacent lathe which receives it and finishes the pointing on a finer steel mill  this mill again stops and another forceps removes the pointed pin into a pair of strong steel clams having a small groove in them by which they hold the pin very firmly a part of this groove which terminates at that edge of the steel clams which is intended to form the head of the pin is made conical a small round steel punch is now driven forcibly against the end of the wire thus clamped and the head of the pin is partially formed by compressing the wire into the conical cavity notes  i have already stated that this principle presented itself to me after a personal examination of a number of manufactories and workshops devoted to different purposes; but i have since found that it had been distinctly pointed out in the work of gioja nuovo prospetto delle scienze economiche tom to milano tom i capo iv  the great expense of turning the wheel appears to have arisen from the person so occupied being unemployed during half his time whilst the pointer went to another manufactory  chapter  on the division of labour  we have already mentioned what may perhaps appear paradoxical to some of our readers that the division of labour can be applied with equal success to mental as to mechanical operations and that it ensures in both the same economy of time a short account of its practical application in the most extensive series of calculations ever executed will offer an interesting illustration of this fact whilst at the same time it will afford an occasion for shewing that the arrangements which ought to regulate the interior economy of a manufactory are founded on principles of deeper root than may have been supposed and are capable of being usefully employed in preparing the road to some of the sublimest investigations of the human mind  in the midst of that excitement which accompanied the revolution of france and the succeeding wars the ambition of the nation unexhausted by its fatal passion for military renown was at the same time directed to some of the nobler and more permanent triumphs which mark the era of a people's greatness and which receive the applause of posterity long after their conquests have been wrested from them or even when their existence as a nation may be told only by the page of history amongst their enterprises of science the french government was desirous of producing a series of mathematical tables to facilitate the application of the decimal system which they had so recently adopted they directed therefore their mathematicians to construct such tables on the most extensive scale their most distinguished philosophers responding fully to the call of their country invented new methods for this laborious task; and a work completely answering the large demands of the government was produced in a remarkably short period of time m prony to whom the superintendence of this great undertaking was confided in speaking of its commencement observes je m'y livrai avec toute l'ardeur dont j'etois

d'appliquer a la connection de ces tables la division du travail dont les arts de commerce tirent un parti si avantageux pour reunir a la pernection de maind'oeuvre l'economie de la depense et du temps the circumstance which gave rise to this singular application of the principle of the division on labour is so interesting that no apology is necessary for introducing it from a small pamphlet printed at paris a few years since when a proposition was made by the english to the french government that the two countries should print these tables at their joint expense  the origin of the idea is related in the following extract c'est a un chapitre d'un ouvrage anglais* justement celebre i qu'est probablement due l'existence de l'ouvrage dont le gouvernement britannique veut faire jouir le monde savant voici l'anecdote m de prony s'etait engage avec les comites de gouvernement a composer pour la division centesimale du cercle des tables logarithmiques et trigonometriques qui non seulement ne laissassent rien a desirer quant a l'exactitude mais qui formassent le monument de calcul e plus vaste et le plus imposant qui eut jamais ete execute ou meme concu les logarithmes des nombres de a formaient a ce travail un supplement necessaire et exige il fut aise a m de prony de s'assurer que meme en s'associant trois ou quatre habiles cooperateurs la plus grande duree presumable de sa vie ne lui sufirai pas pour remplir ses engagements il etait occupe de cette facheuse pensee lorsque se trouvant devant la boutique d'un marchand de livres il appercut la belle edition anglaise de smith donnee a londres en il ouvrit le livre au hazard et tomba sur le premier chapitre qui traite de la division du travail et ou la fabrication des epingles est citee pour exemple a peine avaitil parcouru les premieres pages que par une espece d'inspiration il concut l'expedient de mettre ses logarithmes en manufacture comme les epingles il faisait en ce moment a l'ecole polytechnique des lecons sur une partie d'analyse liee a ce genre de travail la methode des differences et ses applications a l'interpolation il alla passer quelques jours a la campagne et revint a paris avec le plan de fabrication qui a ete suivi dans l'execution il rassembla deux ateliers qui faisai ent separement les memes calculs et se servaient de verification reciproque*  the ancient methods of computing tables were altogether inapplicable to such a proceeding m prony therefore wishing to avail himself of all the talent of his country in devising new methods formed the first section of those who were to take part in this enterprise out of five or six of the most eminent mathematicians in france first section the duty of this first section was to investigate amongst the various analytical expressions which could be found for the same function that which was most readily adapted to simple numerical calculation by many individuals employed at the same time this section had little or nothing to do with the actual numerical work when its labours were concluded the formulae on the use of which it had decided were delivered to the second section second section this section consisted of seven or eight persons of considerable acquaintance with mathematics and their duty was to convert into numbers the formulae put into their hands by the first section an operation of great labour; and then to deliver out these formulae to the members of the third section and receive from them the finished calculations the members of this second section had certain means of verifying the calculations without the necessity of repeating or even of examining the whole of the work done by the third section third section the members of this section whose number varied from sixty to eighty received certain numbers from the second section and using nothing more than simple addition and subtraction they returned to that section the tables in a finished state it is remarkable that ninetenths of this class had no knowledge of arithmetic beyond the two first rules which they were thus called upon to exercise and that these persons were usually found more correct in their calculations than those who possessed a more extensive knowledge of the subject  when it is stated that the tables thus computed occupy seventeen large folio volumes some idea may perhaps be formed of the labour from that part executed by the third class which may almost be termed mechanical requiring the least knowledge and by far the greatest exertions the first class were entirely exempt such labour can always be purchased at an easy rate the duties of the second class although requiring considerable skill in arithmetical operations were yet in some measure relieved by the higher interest naturally felt in those more difficult operations the exertions of the first class are not likely to require upon another occasion so much skill and labour as they did upon the first attempt to introduce such a method; but when the completion of a calculating engine shall have produced a substitute for the whole of the third section of computers the attention of analysts will naturally be directed to simplifying its application by a new discussion of the methods of converting analytical formulae into numbers  the proceeding of m prony in this celebrated system of calculation much resembles that of a skilful person about to construct a cotton or silk mill or any similar establishment having by his own genius or through the aid of his friends found that some improved machinery may be successfully applied to his pursuit he makes drawings of his plans of the machinery and may himself be considered as constituting the first section he next requires the assistance of operative engineers capable of executing the machinery he has designed some of whom should understand the nature of the processes to be carried on; and these constitute his second section when a sufficient number of machines have been made a multitude of other persons possessed of a lower degree of skill must be employed in using them; these form the third section but their work and the just performance of the machines must be still superintended by the second class  as the possibility of performing arithmetical calculations by machinery may appear to nonmathematical readers to be rather too large a postulate and as it is connected with the subject of the division of labour i shall here endeavour in a few lines to give some slight perception of the manner in which this can be doneand thus to remove a small portion of the veil which covers that apparent mystery  that nearly all tables of numbers which follow any law however complicated may be formed to a greater or less extent solely by the proper arrangement of the successive addition and subtraction of numbers befitting each table is a general principle which can be demonstrated to those only who are well acquainted with mathematics; but the mind even of the reader who is but very slightly acquainted with that science will readily conceive that it is not impossible by attending to the following example the subjoined table is the beginning of one in very extensive use which has been printed and reprinted very frequently in many countries and is called a table of square numbers  terms of table a table b first difference c second difference                                                                                any number in the table column a may be obtained by multiplying the number which expresses the distance of that term from the commencement of the table by itself; thus is the fifth term from the beginning of the table and multiplied by itself or by is equal to let us now subtract each term of this table from the next succeeding term and place the results in another column b which may be called first difference column if we again subtract each term of this first difference from the succeeding term we find the result is always the number column c; and that the same number will always recur in that column which may be called the second difference will appear to any person who takes the trouble to carry on the table a few terms further now when once this is admitted it is quite clear that provided the first term of the table the first term of the first differences and the first term of the second or constant difference are originally given we can continue the table of square numbers to any extent merely by addition for the series of first differences may be formed by repeatedly adding the constant difference to the first number in column b and we then have the series of numbers  etc and again by successively adding each of these to the first number of the table we produce the square numbers  having thus i hope thrown some light upon the theoretical part of the question i shall endeavour to shew that the mechanical execution of such an engine as would produce this series of numbers is not so far removed from that of ordinary machinery as might be conceived* let the reader imagine three clocks placed on a table side by side each having only one hand and each having a thousand divisions instead of twelve hours marked on the face; and every time a string is pulled let them strike on a bell the numbers of the divisions to which their hands point let him further suppose that two of the clocks for the sake of distinction called b and c have some mechanism by which the clock c advances the hand of the clock b one division for each stroke it makes upon its own bell and let the clock b by a similar contrivance advance the hand of the clock a one division for each stroke it makes on its own bell with such an arrangement having set the hand of the clock a to the division i that of b to iii and that of c to ii let the reader imagine the repeating parts of the clocks to be set in motion continually in the following order vizpull the string of clock a; pull the string of clock b; pull the string of clock c the table on the following page will then express the series of movements and their results if now only those divisions struck or pointed at by the clock a be attended to and written down it will be found that they produce the series of the squares of the natural numbers such a series could of course be carried by this mechanism only so far as the numbers which can be expressed by three figures; but this may be sufficient to give some idea of the constructionand was in fact the point to which the first model of the calculating engine now in progress extended  we have seen then that the effect of the division of labour both in mechanical and in mental operations is that it enables us to purchase and apply to each process precisely that quantity of skill and knowledge which is required for it we avoid employing any part of the time of a man who can get eight or ten shillings a day by his skill in tempering needles in turning a wheel which can be done for sixpence a day; and we equally avoid the loss arising from the employment of an accomplished mathematician in performing the lowest processes of arithmetic  the division of labour cannot be successfully practised unless there exists a great demand for its produce; and it requires a large capital to be employed in those arts in which it is used in watchmaking it has been carried perhaps to the greatest extent it was stated in evidence before a committee of the house of commons that there are a hundred and two distinct branches of this art to each of which a boy may be put apprentice and that he only learns his master's department and is unable after his apprenticeship has expired without subsequent instruction to work at any other branch the watchfinisher whose business is to put together the scattered parts is the only one out of the hundred and two persons who can work in any other department than his own  in one of the most difficult arts that of mining great improvements have resulted from the judicious distribution of the duties; and under the arrangments which have gradually been introduced the whole system of the mine and its government is now placed under the control of the following officers  a manager who has the general knowledge of all that is to be done and who may be assisted by one or more skilful

le gouvernement anglais des grandes tables logarithmiques et trigonometriques de m de prony de l'imprimerie de f didot december  p  since the publication of the second edition of this work one portion of the engine which i have been constructing for some years past has been put together it calculates in three columns a table with its first and second differences each column can be expressed as far as five figures so that these fifteen figures constitute about one ninth part of the larger engine the ease and precision with which it works leave no room to doubt its success in the more extended

manufacture  the great competition introduced by machinery and the application of the principle of the subdivision of labour render it necessary for each producer to be continually on the watch to discover improved methods by which the cost of the article he manufactures may be reduced; and with this view it is of great importance to know the precise expense of every process as well as of the wear and tear of machinery which is due to it the same information is desirable for those by whom the manufactured goods are distributed and sold; because it enables them to give reasonable answers or explanations to the objections of enquirers and also affords them a better chance of suggesting to the manufacturer changes in the fashion of his goods which may be suitable either to the tastes or to the finances of his customers to the statesman such knowledge is still more important; for without it he must trust entirely to others and can form no judgement worthy of confidence of the effect any tax may produce or of the injury the manufacturer or the country may suffer by its imposition  one of the first advantages which suggests itself as likely to arise from a correct analysis of the expense of the several processes of any manufacture is the indication which it would furnish of the course in which improvement should be directed if a method could be contrived of diminishing by one fourth the time required for fixing on the heads of pins the expense of making them would be reduced about thirteen per cent; whilst a reduction of one half the time employed in spinning the coil of wire out of which the heads are cut would scarcely make any sensible difference in the cost of manufacturing of the whole article it is therefore obvious that the attention would be much more advantageously directed to shortening the former than the latter process  the expense of manufacturing in a country where machinery is of the rudest kind and manual labour is very cheap is curiously exhibited in the price of cotton cloth in the island of java the cotton in the seed is sold by the picul which is a weight of about lbs not above one fourth or one fifth of this weight however is cotton the natives by means of rude wooden rollers can only separate about  lb of cotton from the seed by one day's labour a picul of cleansed cotton therefore is worth between four and five times the cost of the impure article; and the prices of the same substance in its different stages of manufacture arefor one picul  dollars cotton in the seed to  clean cotton to  cotton thread  cotton thread dyed blue  good ordinary cotton cloth  thus it appears that the expense of spinning in java is per cent on the value of the raw material; the expense of dying thread blue is per cent on its value; and that of weaving cotton thread into cloth per cent on its value the expense of spinning cotton into a fine thread is in england about per cent *  as an example of the cost of the different processes of a manufacture perhaps an analytical statement of the expense of the volume now in the reader's hands may not be uninteresting; more especially as it will afford an insight into the nature and extent of the taxes upon literature it is found economical to print it upon paper of a very large size so that although thirtytwo pages instead of sixteen are really contained in each sheet this work is still called octavo       l s d  to printer for composing per sheet of pages l s  sheets  this relates to the ordinary size of the type used in the volume  to printer for composing small type as in extracts and  contents extra per sheet s d  to printer for composing table work extra per sheet  s d average charge for corrections per sheet l s d press work being printed off per sheet l s paper for at l s d per ream weighing lbs the duty on paper at d per lb amounts to s per ream so that the reams which are required for the work will cost  paper excise duty total expense of paper total expense of printing and paper steelplate for titlepage engraving on ditto head of bacon ditto letters total expense of titlepage printing titlepage at s per paper for ditto at s d per expenses of advertising sundries total expense in sheets cost of a single copy in sheets; being printed including the overplus extra boarding cost of each copy boarded*  this analysis requires some explanation the printer usually charges for composition by the sheet supposing the type to be all of one kind; and as this charge is regulated by the size of the letter on which the quantity in a sheet depends little dispute can arise after the price is agreed upon if there are but few extracts or other parts of the work which require to be printed in smaller type; or if there are many notes or several passages in greek or in other languages requiring a different type these are considered in the original contract and a small additional price per sheet allowed if there is a large portion of small type it is better to have a specific additional charge for it per sheet if any work with irregular lines and many figures and what the printers call rules occurs it is called table work and is charged at an advanced price per sheet examples of this are frequent in the present volume if the page consists entirely of figures as in mathematical tables which require very careful correction the charge for composition is usually doubled a few years ago i printed a table of logarithms on a largesized page which required great additional labour and care from the readers* in rendering the proofs correct and for which although new punches were not required several new types were prepared and for which stereotype plates were cast costing about l per sheet in this case l per sheet were charged although ordinary composition with the same sized letter in demy octavo could have been executed at thirtyeight shillings per sheet but as the expense was ascertained before commencing the work it gave rise to no difficulties  the charge for corrections and alterations is one which from the difficulty of measuring them gives rise to the greatest inconvenience and is as disagreeable to the publisher if he be the agent between the author and the printer and to the master printer or his foreman as it is to the author himself if the author study economy he should make the whole of his corrections in the manuscript and should copy it out fairly it will then be printed correctly and he will have little to pay for corrections but it is scarcely possible to judge of the effect of any passage correctly without having it set up in type; and there are few subjects upon which an author does not find he can add some details or explanation when he sees his views in print if therefore he wish to save his own labour in transcribing and to give the last polish to the language he must be content to accomplish these objects at an increased expense if the printer possess a sufficient stock of type it will contribute still more to the convenience of the author to have his whole work put up in what are technically called slips* and then to make all the corrections and to have as few revises as he can the present work was set up in slips but the corrections have been unusually large and the revises frequent  the press work or printing off is charged at a price agreed upon for each two hundred and fifty sheets; and any broken number is still considered as two hundred and fifty when a large edition is required the price for two hundred and fifty is reduced; thus in the present volume two hundred and fifty copies if printed alone would have been charged eleven shillings per sheet instead of s d the actual charge the principle of this mode of charging is good as it obviates all disputes; but it is to be regretted that the custom of charging the same price for any small number as for two hundred and fifty is so pertinaciously adhered to that the workmen will not agree to any other terms when only twenty or thirty copies are required or even when only three or four are wanted for the sake of some experiment perhaps if all numbers above fifty were charged as two hundred and fifty and all below as for half two hundred and fifty both parties would derive an advantage  the effect of the excise duty is to render the paper thin in order that it may weigh little; but this is counteracted by the desire of the author to make his book look as thick as possible in order that he may charge the public as much as he decently can; and so on that ground alone the duty is of no importance there is however another effect of this duty which both the public and the author feel; for they pay not merely the duty which is charged but also the profit on that duty which the papermaker requires for the use of additional capital; and also the profit to the publisher and bookseller on the increased price of the volume  the estimated charge for advertisements is in the present case about the usual allowance for such a volume; and as it is considered that advertisements in newspapers are the most effectual where the smallest pays a duty of s d nearly one half of the charge of advertising is a tax  it appears then that to an expenditure of l necessary to produce the present volume l are added in the shape of a direct tax whether the profits arising from such a mode of manufacturing will justify such a rate of taxation can only be estimated when the returns from the volume are considered a subject that will be discussed in a subsequent chapter* it is at present sufficient to observe that the tax on advertisements is an impolitic tax when contrasted with that upon paper and on other materials employed the object of all advertisements is by making known articles for sale to procure for them a better price if the sale is to be by auction; or a larger extent of sale if by retail dealers now the more any article is known the more quickly it is discovered whether it contributes to the comfort or advantage of the public; and the more quickly its consumption is assured if it be found valuable it would appear then that every tax on communicating information respecting articles which are the subjects of taxation in another shape is one which must reduce the amount that would have been raised had no impediment been placed in the way of making known to the public their qualities and their price notes  these facts are taken from crawford's indian archipelago  these charges refer to the edition prepared for the public and do not relate to the large paper copies in the hands of some of the author's friends  readers are persons employed to correct the press at the printing office  slips are long pieces of paper on which sufficient matter is printed to form when divided from two to four pages of text  chapter chapter  on the causes and consequences of large factories  on examining the analysis which has been given in chapter xix of the operations in the art of pinmaking it will be observed that ten individuals are employed in it and also that the time occupied in executing the several processes is very different in order however to render more simple the reasoning which follows it will be convenient to suppose that each of the seven processes there described requires an equal quantity of time this being supposed it is at once apparent that to conduct an establishment for pinmaking most profitably the number of persons employed must be a multiple of ten for if a person with small means has only sufficient capital to enable him to employ half that number of persons they cannot each of them constantly adhere to the execution of the same process; and if a manufacturer employs any number not a multiple of ten a similar result must ensue with respect to some portion of them the same reflection constantly presents itself on examining any wellarranged factory in that of mr mordan the patentee of the everpointed pencils one room is devoted to some of the processes by which steel pens are manufactured six flypresses are here constantly at work; in the first a sheet of thin steel is brought by the workman under the die which at each blow cuts out a flat piece of the metal having the form intended for the pen two other workmen are employed in placing these flat pieces under two other presses in which a steel chisel cuts the slit three other workmen occupy other presses in which the pieces so prepared receive their semicylindrical form the longer time required for adjusting the small pieces in the two latter operations renders them less rapid in execution than the first; so that two workmen are fully occupied in slitting and three in bending the flat pieces which one man can punch out of the sheet of steel if therefore it were necessary to enlarge this factory it is clear that twelve or eighteen presses would be worked with more economy than any number not a multiple of six the same reasoning extends to every manufacture which is conducted upon the principle of the division of labour and we arrive at this general conclusion when the number of processes into which it is most advantageous to divide it and the number of individuals to be employed in it are ascertained then all factories which do not employ a direct multiple of this latter number will produce the article at a greater cost this principle ought always to be kept in view in great establishments although it is quite impossible even with the best division of the labour to attend to it rigidly in practice the proportionate number of the persons who possess the greatest skill is of course to be first attended to that exact ratio which is more profitable for a factory employing a hundred workmen may not be quite the best where there are five hundred; and the arrangements of both may probably admit of variations without materially increasing the cost of their produce but it is quite certain that no individual nor in the case of pinmaking could any five individuals ever hope to compete with an extensive establishment hence arises one cause of the great size of manufacturing establishments which have increased with the progress of civilization other circumstances however contribute to the same end and arise also from the same cause the division of labour  the material out of which the manufactured article is produced must in the several stages of its progress be conveyed from one operator to the next in succession this can be done at least expense when they are all working in the same establishment if the weight of the material is considerable this reason acts with additional force; but even where it is light the danger arising from frequent removal may render it desirable to have all the processes carried on in the same building in the cutting and polishing of glass this is the case; whilst in the art of needlemaking several of the processes are carried on in the cottages of the workmen it is however clear that the latter plan which is attended with some advantages to the family of the workmen can be adopted only where there exists a sure and quick method of knowing that the work has been well done and that the whole of the materials given out have been really employed  the inducement to contrive machines for any process of manufacture increases with the demand for the article; and the introduction of machinery on the other hand tends to increase the quantity produced and to lead to the establishment of large factories an illustration of these principles may be found in the history of the manufacture of patent net the first machines for weaving this article were very expensive costing from a thousand to twelve or thirteen hundred pounds the possessor of one of these though it greatly increased the quantity he could produce was nevertheless unable when working eight hours a day to compete with the old methods this arose from the large capital invested in the machinery; but he quickly perceived that with the same expense of fixed capital and a small addition to his circulating capital he could work the machine during the whole twentyfour hours the profits thus realized soon induced other persons to direct their attention to the improvement of those machines; and the price was greatly reduced at the same time that the rapidity of production of the patent net was increased but if machines be kept working through the twentyfour hours it is necessary that some person shall attend to admit the workmen at the time they relieve each other; and whether the porter or other servant so employed admit one person or twenty his rest will be equally disturbed it will also be necessary occasionally to adjust or repair the machine; and this can be done much better by a workman accustomed to machinemaking than by the person who uses it now since the good performance and the duration of machines depend to a very great extent upon correcting every shake or imperfection in their parts as soon as they appear the prompt attention of a workman resident on the spot will considerably reduce the expenditure arising from the wear and tear of the machinery but in the case of single lace frame or a single loom this would be too expensive a plan here then arises another circumstance which tends to enlarge the extent of a factory it ought to consist of such a number of machines as shall occupy the whole time of one workman in keeping them in order if extended beyond that number the same principle of economy would point out the necessity of doubling or tripling the number of machines in order to employ the whole time of two or three skilful workmen  where one portion of the workman's labour consists in the exertion of mere physical force as in weaving and in many similar arts it will soon occur to the manufacturer that if that part were executed by a steamengine the same man might in the case of weaving attend to two or more looms at once; and since we already suppose that one or more operative engineers have been employed the number of his looms may be so arranged that their time shall be fully occupied in keeping the steamengine and the looms in order one of the first results will be that the looms can be driven by the engine nearly twice as fast as before and as each man when relieved from bodily labour can attend to two looms one workman can now make almost as much cloth as four this increase of producing power is however greater than that which really took place at first; the velocity of some of the parts of the loom being limited by the strength of the thread and the quickness with which it commences its motion but an improvement was soon made by which the motion commenced slowly and gradually acquired greater velocity than it was safe to give it at once; and the speed was thus increased from to about strokes per minute  pursuing the same principles the manufactory becomes gradually so enlarged that the expense of lighting during the night amounts to a considerable sum; and as there are already attached to the establishment persons who are up all night and can therefore constantly attend to it and also engineers to make and keep in repair any machinery the addition of an apparatus for making gas to light the factory leads to a new extension at the same time that it contributes by diminishing the expense of lighting and the risk of accidents from fire to reduce the cost of manufacturing  long before a factory has reached this extent it will have been found necessary to establish an accountant's department with clerks to pay the workmen and to see that they arrive at their stated times; and this department must be in communication with the agents who purchase the raw produce and with those who sell the manufactured article  we have seen that the application of the division of labour tends to produce cheaper articles; that it thus increases the demand; and gradually by the effect of competition or by the hope of increased gain that it causes large capitals to be embarked in extensive factories let us now examine the influence of this accumulation of capital directed to one object in the first place it enables the most important principle on which the advantages of the division of labour depends to be carried almost to its extreme limits not merely is the precise amount of skill purchased which is necessary for the execution of each process but throughout every stagefrom that in which the raw material is procured to that by which the finished produce is conveyed into the hands of the consumerthe same economy of skill prevails the quantity of work produced by a given number of people is greatly augmented by such an extended arrangement; and the result is necessarily a great reduction in the cost of the article which is brought to market  amongst the causes which tend to the cheap production of any article and which are connected with the employment of additional capital may be mentioned the care which is taken to prevent the absolute waste of any part of the raw material an attention to this circumstance sometimes causes the union of two trades in one factory which otherwise might have been separated an enumeration of the arts to which the horns of cattle are applicable will furnish a striking example of this kind of economy the tanner who has purchased the raw hides separates the horns and sells them to the makers of combs and lanterns the horn consists of two parts an outward horny case and an inward conical substance somewhat intermediate between indurated hair and bone the first process consists in separating these two parts by means of a blow against a block of wood the horny exterior is then cut into three portions with a framesaw  the lowest of these next the root of the horn after undergoing several processes by which it is flattened is made into combs  the middle of the horn after being flattened by heat and having its transparency improved by oil is split into thin layers and forms a substitute for glass in lanterns of the commonest kind  the tip of the horn is used by the makers of knife handles and of the tops of whips and for other similar purposes  the interior or core of the horn is boiled down in water a large quantity of fat rises to the surface; this is put aside and sold to the makers of yellow soap  the liquid itself is used as a kind of glue and is purchased by cloth dressers for stiffening  the insoluble substance which remains behind is then sent to the mill and being ground down is sold to the farmers for manure  besides these various purposes to which the different parts of the horn are applied the clippings which arise in comb making are sold to the farmer for manure in the first year after they are spread over the soil they have comparatively little effect but during the next four or five their efficiency is considerable the shavings which form the refuse of the lantern maker are of a much thinner texture some of them are cut into various figures and painted and used as toys; for being hygrometric they curl up when placed on the palm of a warm hand but the greater part of these shavings also are sold for manure and from their extremely thin and divided form the full effect is produced upon the first crop  another event which has arisen in one trade at least from the employment of large capital is that a class of middlemen formerly interposed between the maker and the merchant now no longer exist when calico was woven in the cottages of the workmen there existed a class of persons who travelled about and purchased the pieces so made in large numbers for the purpose of selling them to the exporting merchant but the middlemen were obliged to examine every piece in order to know that it was perfect and of full measure the greater number of the workmen it is true might be depended upon but the fraud of a few would render this examination indispensable for any single cottager though detected by one purchaser might still hope that the fact would not become known to all the rest the value of character though great in all circumstances of life can never be so fully experienced by persons possessed of small capital as by those employing much larger sums whilst these larger sums of money for which the merchant deals render his character for punctuality more studied and known by others thus it happens that high character supplies the place of an additional portion of capital; and the merchant in dealing with the great manufacturer is saved from the expense of verification by knowing that the loss or even the impeachment of the manufacturer's character would be attended with greater injury to himself than any profit upon a single transaction could compensate  the amount of wellgrounded confidence which exists in the character of its merchants and manufacturers is one of the many advantages that an old manufacturing country always possesses over its rivals to such an extent is this confidence in character carried in england that at one of our largest towns sales and purchases on a very extensive scale are made daily in the course of business without any of the parties ever exchanging a written document  a breach of confidence of this kind which might have been attended with very serious embarrassment occurred in the recent expedition to the mouth of the niger 'we brought with us from england' mr lander states 'nearly a hundred thousand needles of various sizes and amongst them was a great quantity of whitechapel sharps warranted superfine and not to cut in the eye thus highly recommended we imagined that these needles must have been excellent indeed; but what was our surprise some time ago when a number of them which we had disposed of were returned to us with a complaint that they were all eyeless thus redeeming with a vengeance the pledge of the manufacturer that they would not cut in the eye on examination afterwards we found the same fault with the remainder of the whitechapel sharps so that to save our credit we have been obliged to throw them away'*  the influence of established character in producing confidence operated in a very remarkable manner at the time of the exclusion of british manufactures from the continent during the last war one of our largest establishments had been in the habit of doing extensive business with a house in the centre of germany; but on the closing of the continental ports against our manufactures heavy penalties were inflicted on all those who contravened the berlin and milan decrees the english manufacturer continued nevertheless to receive orders with directions how to consign them and appointments for the time and mode of payment in letters the handwriting of which was known to him but which were never signed except by the christian name of one of the firm and even in some instances they were without any signature at all these orders were executed; and in no instance was there the least irregularity in the payments  another circumstance may be noticed which to a small extent is more advantageous to large than to small factories in the export of several articles of manufacture a drawback is allowed by government of a portion of the duty paid on the importation of the raw material in such circumstances certain forms must be gone through in order to protect the revenue from fraud; and a clerk or one of the partners must attend at the customhouse the agent of the large establishment occupies nearly the same time in receiving a drawback of several thousands as the smaller exporter does of a few shillings but if the quantity exported is inconsiderable the small manufacturer frequently does not find the drawback will repay him for the loss of time  in many of the large establishments of our manufacturing districts substances are employed which are the produce of remote countries and which are in several instances almost peculiar to a few situations the discovery of any new locality where such articles exist in abundance is a matter of great importance to any establishment which consumes them in large quantities; and it has been found in some instances that the expense of sending persons to great distances purposely to discover and to collect such produce has been amply repaid thus it has happened that the snowy mountains of sweden and norway as well as the warmer hills of corsica have been almost stripped of one of their vegetable productions by agents sent expressly from one of our largest establishments for the dying of calicos owing to the same command of capital and to the scale upon which the operations of large factories are carried on their returns admit of the expense of sending out agents to examine into the wants and tastes of distant countries as well as of trying experiments which although profitable to them would be ruinous to smaller establishments possessing more limited resources these opinions have been so well expressed in the report of the committee of the house of commons on the woollen trade in that we shall close this chapter with an extract in which the advantages of great factories are summed up your committee have the satisfaction of seeing that the apprehensions entertained of factories are not only vicious in principle but they are practically erroneous to such a degree that even the very opposite principles might be reasonably entertained nor would it be difficult to prove that the factories to a certain extent at least and in the present day seem absolutely necessary to the wellbeing of the domestic system supplying those very particulars wherein the domestic system must be acknowledged to be inherently defective for it is obvious that the little master manufacturers cannot afford like the man who possesses considerable capital to try the experiments which are requisite and incur the risks and even losses which almost always occur in inventing and perfecting new articles of manufacture or in carrying to a state of greater perfection articles already established he cannot learn by personal inspection the wants and habits the arts manufactures and improvements of foreign countries; diligence economy and prudence are the requisites of his character not invention taste and enterprise nor would he be warranted in hazarding the loss of any part of his small capital he walks in a sure road as long as he treads in the beaten track; but he must not deviate into the paths of speculation the owner of a factory on the contrary being commonly possessed of a large capital and having all his workmen employed under his own immediate superintendence may make experiments hazard speculation invent shorter or better modes of performing old processes may introduce new articles and improve and perfect old ones thus giving the range to his taste and fancy and thereby alone enabling our manufacturers to stand the competition with their commercial rivals in other countries meanwhile as is well worthy of remark and experience abundantly warrants the assertion many of these new fabrics and inventions when their success is once established become general amongst the whole body of manufacturers the domestic manufacturers themselves thus benefiting in the end from those very factories which had been at first the objects of their jealousy the history of almost all our other manufactures in which great improvements have been made of late years in some cases at an immense expense and after numbers of unsuccessful experiments strikingly illustrates and enforces the above remarks it is besides an acknowledged fact that the owners of factories are often amongst the most extensive purchasers at the halls where they buy from the domestic clothier the established articles of manufacture or are able at once to answer a great and sudden order; whilst at home and under their own superintendence they make their fancy goods and any articles of a newer more costly or more delicate quality to which they are enabled by the domestic system to apply a much larger proportion of their capital thus the two systems instead of rivalling are mutual aids to each other each supplying the other's defects and promoting the other's prosperity notes  lander's journal of an expedition to the mouth of the niger vol ii p chapter  on the position of large factories  it is found in every country that the situation of large manufacturing establishments is confined to particular districts in the earlier history of a manufacturing community before cheap modes of transport have been extensively introduced it will almost always be found that manufactories are placed near those spots in which nature has produced the raw material especially in the case of articles of great weight and in those the value of which depends more upon the material than upon the labour expended on it most of the metallic ores being exceedingly heavy and being mixed up with large quantities of weighty and useless materials must be smelted at no great distance from the spot which affords them fuel and power are the requisites for reducing them; and any considerable fall of water in the vicinity will naturally be resorted to for aid in the coarser exertions of physical force; for pounding the ore for blowing the furnaces or for hammering and rolling out the iron there are indeed peculiar circumstances which will modify this iron coal and limestone commonly occur in the same tracts; but the union of the fuel in the same locality with the ore does not exist with respect to other metals the tracts generally the most productive of metallic ores are geologically speaking different from those affording coal thus in cornwall there are veins of copper and of tin but no beds of coal the copper ore which requires a very large quantity of fuel for its reduction is sent by sea to the coalfields of wales and is smelted at swansea; whilst the vessels which convey it take back coals to work the steamengines for draining the mines and to smelt the tin which requires for that purpose a much smaller quantity of fuel than copper  rivers passing through districts rich in coal and metals will form the first highroads for the conveyance of weighty produce to stations in which other conveniences present themselves for the further application of human skill canals will succeed or lend their aid to these; and the yet unexhausted applications of steam and of gas hold out a hope of attaining almost the same advantages for countries to which nature seemed for ever to have denied them manufactures commerce and civilization always follow the line of new and cheap communications twenty years ago the mississippi poured the vast volume of its waters in lavish profusion through thousands of miles of countries which scarcely supported a few wandering and uncivilized tribes of indians the power of the stream seemed to set at defiance the efforts of man to ascend its course; and as if to render the task still more hopeless large trees torn from the surrounding forests were planted like stakes in its bottom forming in some places barriers in others the nucleus of banks; and accumulating in the same spot which but for accident would have been free from both the difficulties and dangers of shoals and of rocks four months of incessant toil could scarcely convey a small bark with its wornout crew two thousand miles up this stream the same voyage is now performed in fifteen days by large vessels impelled by steam carrying hundreds of passengers enjoying all the comforts and luxuries of civilized life instead of the hut of the indian and the far more unfrequent log house of the thinly scattered settlersvillages towns and cities have arisen on its banks; and the same engine which stems the force of these powerful waters will probably tear from their bottom the obstructions which have hitherto impeded and rendered dangerous their navigation*  the accumulation of many large manufacturing establishments in the same district has a tendency to bring together purchasers or their agents from great distances and thus to cause the institution of a public mart or exchange this contributes to diffuse information relative to the supply of raw materials and the state of demand for their produce with which it is necessary manufacturers should be well acquainted the very circumstance of collecting periodically at one place a large number both of those who supply the market and of those who require its produce tends strongly to check the accidental fluctuations to which a small market is always subject as well as to render the average of the prices much more uniform  when capital has been invested in machinery and in buildings for its accommodation and when the inhabitants of the neighbourhood have acquired a knowledge of the modes of working at the machines reasons of considerable weight are required to cause their removal such changes of position do however occur; and they have been alluded to by the committee on the fluctuation of manufacturers' employment as one of the causes interfering most materially with an uniform rate of wages it is therefore of particular importance to the workmen to be acquainted with the real causes which have driven manufactures from their ancient seats the migration or change of place of any manufacture has sometimes arisen from improvements of machinery not applicable to the spot where such manufacture was carried on as appears to have been the case with the woollen manufacture which has in great measure migrated from essex suffolk and other southern counties to the northern districts where coal for the use of the steamengine is much cheaper but this change has in some instances been caused or accelerated by the conduct of the workmen in refusing a reasonable reduction of wages or opposing the introduction of some kind of improved machinery or process; so that during the dispute another spot has in great measure supplied their place in the market any violence used by the workmen against the property of their masters and any unreasonable combination on their part is almost sure thus to be injurious to themselves  these removals become of serious consequence when the factories have been long established because a population commensurate with their wants invariably grows up around them the combinations in nottinghamshire of persons under the name of luddites drove a great number of lace frames from that district and caused establishments to be formed in devonshire we ought also to observe that the effect of driving any establishment into a new district where similar works have not previously existed is not merely to place it out of the reach of such combinations; but after a few years the example of its success will most probably induce other capitalists in the new district to engage in the same manufacture and thus although one establishment only should be driven away the workmen through whose combination its removal is effected will not merely suffer by the loss of that portion of demand for their labour which the factory caused; but the value of that labour will itself be reduced by the competition of a new field of production  another circumstance which has its influence on this question is the nature of the machinery heavy machinery such as stampingmills steamengines etc cannot readily be moved and must always be taken to pieces for that purpose; but when the machinery of a factory consists of a multitude of separate engines each complete in itself and all put in motion by one source of power such as that of steam then the removal is much less inconvenient thus stocking frames lace machines and looms can be transported to more favourable positions with but a small separation of their parts  it is of great importance that the more intelligent amongst the class of workmen should examine into the correctness of these views; because without having their attention directed to them the whole class may in some instances be led by designing persons to pursue a course which although plausible in appearance is in reality at variance with their own best interests i confess i am not without a hope that this volume may fall into the hands of workmen perhaps better qualified than myself to reason upon a subject which requires only plain common sense and whose powers are sharpened by its importance to their personal happiness in asking their attention to the preceding remarks and to those which i shall offer respecting combinations i can claim only one advantage over them; namely that i never have had and in all human probability never shall have the slightest pecuniary interest to influence even remotely or by anticipation the judgements i have formed on the facts which have come before me notes  the amount of obstructions arising from the casual fixing of trees in the bottom of the river may be estimated from the proportion of steamboats destroyed by running upon them the subjoined statement is taken from the american almanack for  between the years and three hundred and fortyeight steamboats were built on the mississippi and its tributary streams during that period a hundred and fifty were lost or worn out of this hundred and fifty worn out       lost by snags      burnt        lost by collision     by accidents not ascertained thirty six or nearly one fourth being destroyed by accidental obstruction snag is the name given in america to trees which stand nearly upright in the stream with their roots fixed at the bottom it is usual to divide off at the bow of the steamboats a watertight chamber in order that when a hole is made in it by running against the snags the water may not enterthe rest of the vessel and sink it intantly  chapter  on over manufacturing  one of the natural and almost inevitable consequences of competition is the production of a supply much larger than the demand requires this result usually arises periodically; and it is equally important both to the masters and to the workmen to prevent its occurrence or to foresee its arrival in situations where a great number of very small capitalists existwhere each master works himself and is assisted by his own family or by a few journeymenand where a variety of different articles is produced a curious system of compensation has arisen which in some measure diminishes the extent to which fluctuations of wages would otherwise reach this is accomplished by a species of middlemen or factors persons possessing some capital who whenever the price of any of the articles in which they deal is greatly reduced purchase it on their own account in the hopes of selling at a profit when the market is better these persons in ordinary times act as salesmen or agents and make up assortments of goods at the market price for the use of the home or foreign dealer they possess large warehouses in which to make up their orders or keep in store articles purchased during periods of depression; thus acting as a kind of flywheel in equalizing the market price  the effect of overmanufacturing upon great establishments is different when an over supply has reduced prices one of two events usually occurs the first is a diminished payment for labour; the other is a diminution of the number of hours during which the labourers work together with a diminished rate of wages in the former case production continues to go on at its ordinary rate in the latter the production itself being checked the supply again adjusts itself to the demand as soon as the stock on hand is worked off and prices then regain their former level the latter course appears in the first instance to be the best both for masters and men; but there seems to be a difficulty in accomplishing this except where the trade is in few hands in fact it is almost necessary for its success that there should be a combination amongst the masters or amongst the men; or what is always far preferable to either a mutual agreement for their joint interests combination amongst the men is difficult and is always attended with the evils which arise from the illwill excited against any persons who in the perfectly justifiable exercise of their judgement are disposed not to act with the majority the combination of the masters on the other hand is unavailing unless the whole body of them agree for if any one master can procure more labour for his money than the rest he will be able to undersell them  if we look only at the interests of the consumer the case is different when too large a supply has produced a great reduction of price it opens the consumption of the article to a new class and increases the consumption of those who previously employed it it is therefore against the interest of both these parties that a return to the former price should occur it is also certain that by the diminution of profit which the manufacturer suffers from the diminished price his ingenuity will be additionally stimulated; that he will apply himself to discover other and cheaper sources for the supply of his raw material; that he will endeavour to contrive improved machinery which shall manufacture it at a cheaper rate; or try to introduce new arrangements into his factory which shall render the economy of it more perfect in the event of his success by any of these courses or by their joint effects a real and substantial good will be produced a larger portion of the public will receive advantage from the use of the article and they will procure it at a lower price; and the manufacturer though his profit on each operation is reduced will yet by the more frequent returns on the larger produce of his factory find his real gain at the end of the year nearly the same as it was before; whilst the wages of the workman will return to their level and both the manufacturer and the workman will find the demand less fluctuating from its being dependent on a larger number of customers  it would be highly interesting if we could trace even approximately through the history of any great manufacture the effects of gluts in producing improvements in machinery or in methods of working; and if we could shew what addition to the annual quantity of goods previously manufactured was produced by each alteration it would probably be found that the increased quantity manufactured by the same capital when worked with the new improvement would produce nearly the same rate of profit as other modes of investment perhaps the manufacture of iron* would furnish the best illustration of this subject; because by having the actual price of pig and bar iron at the same place and at the same time the effect of a change in the value of currency as well as several other sources of irregularity would be removed  at the present moment whilst the manufacturers of iron are complaining of the ruinously low price of their produce a new mode of smelting iron is coming into use which if it realizes the statement of the patentees promises to reduce greatly the cost of production the improvement consists in heating the air previously to employing it for blowing the furnace one of the results is that coal may be used instead of coke; and this in its turn diminishes the quantity of limestone which is required for the fusion of the iron stone the following statement by the proprietors of the patent is extracted from brewster's journal p  comparative view of the quantity of materials required at the clyde iron works to smelt a ton of foundry pigiron and of the quantity of foundry pigiron smelted from each furnace weekly fuel in tons of cwt each cwt lbs; ironstone; limestone cwt; weekly produce in pigiron tons  with air not heated and coke; ; ; ;  with air heated and coke; ; ; ;  with air heated and coals not coked; ; ; ;  notes to the coals stated in the second and third lines must be added cwt of small coals required to heat the air  the expense of the apparatus for applying the heated air will be from l to l per furnace  no coals are now coked at the clyde iron works; at all the three furnaces the iron is smelted with coals  the three furnaces are blown by a doublepowered steamengine with a steam cylinder inches in diameter and a blowing cylinder inches in diameter which compresses the air so as to carry  lbs per square inch there are two tuyeres to each furnace the muzzles of the blowpipes are inches in diameter  the air heated to upwards of degrees of fahrenheit it will melt lead at the distance of three inches from the orifice through which it issues from the pipe  the increased effect produced by thus heating the air is by no means an obvious result; and an analysis of its action will lead to some curious views respecting the future application of machinery for blowing furnaces every cubic foot of atmospheric air driven into a furnace consists of two gases* about onefifth being oxygen and fourfifths azote according to the present state of chemical knowledge the oxygen alone is effective in producing heat; and the operation of blowing a furnace may be thus analysed  the air is forced into the furnace in a condensed state and immediately expanding abstracts heat from the surrounding bodies  being itself of moderate temperature it would even without expansion still require heat to raise it to the temperature of the hot substances to which it is to be applied  on coming into contact with the ignited substances in the furnace the oxygen unites with them parting at the same moment with a large portion of its latent heat and forming compounds which have less specific heat than their separate constituents some of these pass up the chimney in a gaseous state whilst others remain in the form of melted slags floating on the surface of the iron which is fused by the heat thus set at liberty  the effects of the azote are precisely similar to the first and second of those above described; it seems to form no combinations and contributes nothing in any stage to augment the heat the plan therefore of heating the air before driving it into the furnace saves obviously the whole of that heat which the fuel must have supplied in raising it from the temperature of the external air up to that of degrees fahrenheit; thus rendering the fire more intense and the glassy slags more fusible and perhaps also more effectually decomposing the iron ore the same quantity of fuel applied at once to the furnace would only prolong the duration of its heat not augment its intensity  the circumstance of so large a portion of the air* driven into furnaces being not merely useless but acting really as a cooling instead of a heating cause added to so great a waste of mechanical power in condensing it amounting in fact to fourfifths of the whole clearly shews the defects of the present method and the want of some better mode of exciting combustion on a large scale the following suggestions are thrown out as likely to lead to valuable results even though they should prove ineffectual for their professed object  the great difficulty appears to be to separate the oxygen which aids combustion from the azote which impedes it if either of those gases becomes liquid at a lower pressure than the other and if those pressures are within the limits of our present powers of compression the object might be accomplished let us assume for example that oxygen becomes liquid under a pressure of atmospheres whilst azote requires a pressure of then if atmospheric air be condensed to the two hundredth part of its bulk the oxygen will be found in a liquid state at the bottom of the vessel in which the condensation is effected and the upper part of the vessel will contain only azote in the state of gas the oxygen now liquefied may be drawn off for the supply of the furnace; but as it ought when used to have a very moderate degree of condensation its expansive force may be previously employed in working a small engine the compressed azote also in the upper part of the vessel though useless for combustion may be employed as a source of power and by its expansion work another engine by these means the mechanical force exerted in the original compression would all be restored except that small part retained for forcing the pure oxygen into the furnace and the much larger part lost in the friction of the apparatus  the principal difficulty to be apprehended in these operations is that of packing a working piston so as to bear the pressure of or atmospheres but this does not seem insurmountable it is possible also that the chemical combination of the two gases which constitute common air may be effected by such pressures if this should be the case it might offer a new mode of manufacturing nitrous or nitric acids the result of such experiments might take another direction if the condensation were performed over liquids it is possible that they might enter into new chemical combinations thus if air were highly condensed in a vessel containing water the latter might unite with an additional dose of oxygen * which might afterwards be easily disengaged for the use of the furnace  a further cause of the uncertainty of the results of such an experiment arises from the possibility that azote may really contribute to the fusion of the mixed mass in the furnace though its mode of operating is at present unknown an examination of the nature of the gases issuing from the chimneys of ironfoundries might perhaps assist in clearing up this point; and in fact if such enquiries were also instituted upon the various products of all furnaces we might expect the elucidation of many points in the economy of the metallurgic art  it is very possible also that the action of oxygen in a liquid state might be exceedingly corrosive and that the containing vessels must be lined with platinum or some other substance of very difficult oxydation; and most probably new and unexpected compounds would be formed at such pressures in some experiments made by count rumford in on the force of fired gunpowder he noticed a solid compound which always appeared in the gunbarrel when the ignited powder had no means of escaping; and in those cases the gas which escaped on removing the restraining pressure was usually inconsiderable  if the liquefied gases are used the form of the iron furnace must probably be changed and perhaps it may be necessary to direct the flame from the ignited fuel upon the ore to be fused instead of mixing that ore with the fuel itself by a proper regulation of the blast an oxygenating or a deoxygenating flame might be procured; and from the intensity of the flame combined with its chemical agency we might expect the most refractory ore to be smelted and that ultimately the metals at present almost infusible such as platinum titanium and others might be brought into common use and thus effect a revolution in the arts  supposing on the occurrence of a glut that new and cheaper modes of producing are not discovered and that the production continues to exceed the demand then it is apparent that too much capital is employed in the trade; and after a time the diminished rate of profit will drive some of the manufacturers to other occupations what particular individuals will leave it must depend on a variety of circumstances superior industry and attention will enable some factories to make a profit rather beyond the rest; superior capital in others will enable them without these advantages to support competition longer even at a loss with the hope of driving the smaller capitalists out of the market and then reimbursing themselves by an advanced price it is however better for all parties that this contest should not last long; and it is important that no artificial restraint should interfere to prevent it an instance of such restriction and of its injurious effect occurs at the port of newcastle where a particular act of parliament requires that every ship shall be loaded in its turn the committee of the house of commons in their report on the coal trade state that  'under the regulations contained in this act if more ships enter into the trade than can be profitablv employed in it the loss produced by detention in port and waiting for a cargo which must consequently take place instead of falling as it naturally would upon particular ships and forcing them from the trade is now divided evenly amongst them; and the loss thus created is shared by the whole number' report p it is not pretended in this short view to trace out all the effects or remedies of overmanufacturing; the subject is difficult and unlike some of the questions already treated requires a combined view of the relative influence of many concurring causes notes  the average price per ton of pig iron bar iron and coal together with the price paid for labour at the works for a long series of years would be very valuable and i shall feel much indebted to anyone who will favour me with it for any even short period  the accurate proportions are by measure oxygen azote  a similar reasoning may be applied to lamps an argand burner whether used for consuming oil or gas admits almost an unlimited quantity of air it would deserve enquiry whether a smaller quantity might not produce greater light; and possibly a different supply furnish more heat with the same expenditure of fuel  deutoxide of hydrogen the oxygenated water of thenard  chapter  enquiries previous to commencing any manufactory  there are many enquiries which ought always to be made previous to the commencement of the manufacture of any new article these chiefly relate to the expense of tools machinery raw materials and all the outgoings necessary for its production; to the extent of demand which is likely to arise; to the time in which the circulating capital will be replaced; and to the quickness or slowness with which the new article will supersede those already in use  the expense of tools and of new machines will be more difficult to ascertain in proportion as they differ from those already employed; but the variety in constant use in our various manufactories is such that few inventions now occur in which considerable resemblance may not be traced to others already constructed the cost of the raw material is usually less difficult to determine; but cases occasionally arise in which it becomes important to examine whether the supply at the given price can be depended upon for in the case of a small consumption the additional demand arising from a factory may produce a considerable temporary rise though it may ultimately reduce the price  the quantity of any new article likely to be consumed is a most important subject for the consideration of the projector of a new manufacture as these pages are not intended for the instruction of the manufacturer but rather for the purpose of giving a general view of the subject an illustration of the way in which such questions are regarded by practical men will perhaps be most instructive the following extract from the evidence given before a committee of the house of commons in the report on artizans and machinery shews the extent to which articles apparently the most insignificant are consumed and the view which the manufacturer takes of them the person examined on this occasion was mr ostler a manufacturer of glass beads and other toys of the same substance from birmingham several of the articles made by him were placed upon the table for the inspection of the committee of the house of commons which held its meetings in one of the committeerooms question is there any thing else you have to state upon this subject? answer gentlemen may consider the articles on the table as extremely insignificant but perhaps i may surprise them a little by mentioning the following fact eighteen years ago on my first journey to london a respectablelooking man in the city asked me if i could supply him with dolls' eyes; and i was foolish enough to feel half offended; i thought it derogatory to my new dignity as a manufacturer to make dolls' eyes he took me into a room quite as wide and perhaps twice the length of this and we had just room to walk between stacks from the loor to the ceiling of parts of dolls he said 'these are only the legs and arms; the trunks are below but i saw enough to convince me that he wanted a great many eyes; and as the article appeared quite in my own line of business i said i would take an order by way of experiment; and he shewed me several specimens i copied the order he ordered various quantities and of various sizes and qualities on returning to the tavistock hotel i found that the order amounted to upwards of l i went into the country and endeavoured to make them i had some of the most ingenious glass toymakers in the kingdom in my service; but when i shewed it to them they shook their heads and said they had often seen the article before but could not make it i engaged them by presents to use their best exertions; but after trying and wasting a great deal of time for three or four weeks i was obliged to relinquish the attempt soon afterwards i engaged in another branch of business chandelier furniture and took no more notice of it about eighteen months ago i resumed the trinket trade and then determined to think of the dolls' eyes; and about eight months since i accidentally met with a poor fellow who had impoverished himself by drinking and who was dying in a consumption in a state of great want i showed him ten sovereigns and he said he would instruct me in the process he was in such a state that he could not bear the effluvia of his own lamp but though i was very conversant with the manual part of the business and it related to things i was daily in the habit of seeing i felt i could do nothing from his description i mention this to show how difficult it is to convey by description the mode of working he took me into his garret where the poor fellow had economized to such a degree that he actually used the entrails and fat of poultry from leadenhall market to save oil the price of the article having been lately so much reduced by competition at home in an instant before i had seen him make three i felt competent to make a gross; and the difference between his mode and that of my own workmen was so trifling that i felt the utmost astonishment question you can now make dolls' eyes? answer i can as it was eighteen years ago that i received the order i have mentioned and feeling doubtful of my own recollection though very strong and suspecting that it could not have been to the amount stated i last night took the present very reduced price of that article less than half now of what it was then and calculating that every child in this country not using a doll till two years old and throwing it aside at seven and having a new one annually i satisfied myself that the eyes alone would produce a circulation of a great many thousand pounds i mention this merely to shew the importance of trifles; and to assign one reason amongst many for my conviction that nothing but personal communication can enable our manufactures to be transplanted  in many instances it is exceedingly difficult to estimate beforehand the sale of an article or the effects of a machine; a case however occurred during a recent enquiry which although not quite appropriate as an illustration of probable demand is highly instructive as to the mode of conducting investigations of this nature a committee of the house of commons was appointed to enquire into the tolls proper to be placed on steamcarriages; a question apparently of difficult solution and upon which widely different opinions had been formed if we may judge by the very different rate of tolls imposed upon such carriages by different 'turnpike trusts' the principles on which the committee conducted the enquiry were that 'the only ground on which a fair claim to toll can be made on any public road is to raise a fund which with the strictest economy shall be just sufficientfirst to repay the expense of its original formation; secondly to maintain it in good and sufficient repair' they first endeavoured to ascertain from competent persons the effect of the atmosphere alone in deteriorating a wellconstructed road the next step was to determine the proportion in which the road was injured by the effect of the horses' feet compared with that of the wheels mr macneill the superintendent under mr telford of the holyhead roads was examined and proposed to estimate the relative injury from the comparative quantities of iron worn off from the shoes of the horses and from the tire of the wheels from the data he possessed respecting the consumption of iron for the tire of the wheels and for the shoes of the horses of one of the birmingham daycoaches he estimated the wear and tear of roads arising from the feet of the horses to be three times as great as that arising from the wheels supposing repairs amounting to a hundred pounds to be required on a road travelled over by a fast coach at the rate of ten miles an hour and the same amount of injury to occur on another road used only by waggons moving at the rate of three miles an hour mr macneill divides the injuries in the following proportions  injuries arising from; fast coach; heavy waggon atmospheric changes    wheels       horses' feet drawing    total injury     supposing it therefore to be ascertained that the wheels of steam carriages do no more injury to roads than other carriages of equal weight travelling with the same velocity the committee now possessed the means of approximating to a just rate of toll for steam carriages*  as connected with this subject and as affording most valuable information upon points in which previous to experiment widely different opinions have been entertained; the following extract is inserted from mr telford's report on the state of the holyhead and liverpool roads the instrument employed for the comparison was invented by mr macneill; and the road between london and shrewsbury was selected for the place of experiment the general results when a waggon weighing cwt was used on different sorts of roads are as follows       lbs on wellmade pavement the draught is  on a broken stone surface or old flint road  on a gravel road  on a broken stone road upon a rough pavement foundation  on a broken stone surface upon a bottoming of concrete formed of parker's cement and gravel  the following statement relates to the force required to draw a coach weighing cwt exclusive of seven passengers up roads of various inclinations inclination; force required at six miles per hour; force at eight miles per hour; force at ten miles per hour   lbs lbs lbs  in   in   in   in   in   in establishing a new manufactory the time in which the goods produced can be brought to market and the returns be realized should be thoroughly considered as well as the time the new article will take to supersede those already in use if it is destroyed in using the new produce will be much more easily introduced steel pens readily took the place of quills; and a new form of pen would if it possessed any advantage as easily supersede the present one a new lock however secure and however cheap would not so readily make its way if less expensive than the old it would be employed in new work but old locks would rarely be removed to make way for it; and even if perfectly secure its advance would be slow  another element in this question which should not be altogether omitted is the opposition which the new manufacture may create by its real or apparent injury to other interests and the probable effect of that opposition this is not always foreseen; and when anticipated is often inaccurately estimated on the first establishment of steamboats from london to margate the proprietors of the coaches running on that line of road petitioned the house of commons against them as likely to lead to the ruin of the coach proprietors it was however found that the fear was imaginary; and in a very few years the number of coaches on that road was considerably increased apparently through the very means which were thought to be adverse to it the fear which is now entertained that steampower and railroads may drive out of employment a large proportion of the horses at present in use is probably not less unfounded on some particular lines such an effect might be produced; but in all probability the number of horses employed in conveying goods and passengers to the great lines of railroad would exceed that which is at present used notes  one of the results of these enquiries is that every coach which travels from london to birmingham distributes about eleven pounds of wrought iron along with the line of road between the two places  chapter  on a new system of manufacturing  a most erroneous and unfortunate opinion prevails amongst workmen in many manufacturing countries that their own interest and that of their employers are at variance the consequences are that valuable machinery is sometimes neglected and even privately injuredthat new improvements introduced by the masters do not receive a fair trialand that the talents and observations of the workmen are not directed to the improvement of the processes in which they are employed this error is perhaps most prevalent where the establishment of manufactories has been of recent origin and where the number of persons employed in them is not very large thus in some of the prussian provinces on the rhine it prevails to a much greater extent than in lancashire perhaps its diminished prevalence in our own manufacturing districts arises partly from the superior information spread amongst the workmen; and partly from the frequent example of persons who by good conduct and an attention to the interests of their employers for a series of years have become foremen or who have ultimately been admitted into advantageous partnerships convinced as i am from my own observation that the prosperity and success of the master manufacturer is essential to the welfare of the workman i am yet compelled to admit that this connection is in many cases too remote to be always understood by the latter and whilst it is perfectly true that workmen as a class derive advantage from the prosperity of their employers i do not think that each individual partakes of that advantage exactly in proportion to the extent to which he contributes towards it; nor do i perceive that the resulting advantage is as immediate as it might become under a different system  it would be of great importance if in every large establishment the mode of payment could be so arranged that every person employed should derive advantage from the success of the whole; and that the profits of each individual should advance as the factory itself produced profit without the necessity of making any change in the wages this is by no means easy to effect particularly amongst that class whose daily labour procures for them their daily food the system which has long been pursued in working the cornish mines although not exactly fulfilling these conditions yet possesses advantages which make it worthy of attention as having nearly approached towards them and as tending to render fully effective the faculties of all who are engaged in it i am the more strongly induced to place before the reader a short sketch of this system because its similarity to that which i shall afterwards recommend for trial will perhaps remove some objections to the latter and may also furnish some valuable hints for conducting any experiment which might be undertaken  in the mines of cornwall almost the whole of the operations both above and below ground are contracted for the manner of making the contract is nearly as follows at the end of every two months the work which it is proposed to carry on during the next period is marked out it is of three kinds tutwork which consists in sinking shafts driving levels and making excavations this is paid for by the fathom in depth or in length or by the cubic fathom tribute which is payment for raising and dressing the ore by means of a certain part of its value when rendered merchantable it is this mode of payment which produces such admirable effects the miners who are to be paid in proportion to the richness of the vein and the quantity of metal extracted from it naturally become quicksighted in the discovery of ore and in estimating its value; and it is their interest to avail themselves of every improvement that can bring it more cheaply to market dressing the 'tributors' who dig and dress the ore can seldom afford to dress the coarser parts of what they raise at their contract price; this portion therefore is again let out to other persons who agree to dress it at an advanced price the lots of ore to be dressed and the works to be carried on having been marked out some days before and having been examined by the men a kind of auction is held by the captains of the mine in which each lot is put up and bid for by different gangs of men the work is then offered at a price usually below that bid at the auction to the lowest bidder who rarely declines it at the rate proposed the tribute is a certain sum out of every twenty shillings' worth of ore raised and may vary from threepence to fourteen or fifteen shillings the rate of earnings in tribute is very uncertain if a vein which was poor when taken becomes rich the men earn money rapidly; and instances have occurred in which each miner of a gang has gained a hundred pounds in the two months these extraordinary cases are perhaps of more advantage to the owners of the mine than even to the men; for whilst the skill and industry of the workmen are greatly stimulated the owner himself always derives still greater advantage from the improvement of the vein* this system has been introduced by mr taylor into the lead mines of flintshire into those at skipton in yorkshire and into some of the copper mines of cumberland; and it is desirable that it should become general because no other mode of payment affords to the workmen a measure of success so directly proportioned to the industry the integrity and the talent which they exert  i shall now present the outline of a system which appears to me to be pregnant with the most important results both to the class of workmen and to the country at large; and which if acted upon would in my opinion permanently raise the working classes and greatly extend the manufacturing system the general principles on which the proposed system is founded are  that a considerable part of the wages received by each person employed should depend on the profits made by the establishment; and  that every person connected with it should derive more advantage from applying any improvement he might discover to the factory in which he is employed than he could by any other course  it would be difficult to prevail on the large capitalist to enter upon any system which would change the division of the profits arising from the employment of his capital in setting skill and labour in action; any alteration therefore must be expected rather from the small capitalist or from the higher class of workmen who combine the two characters; and to these latter classes whose welfare will be first affected the change is most important i shall therefore first point out the course to be pursued in making the experiment; and then taking a particular branch of trade as an illustration i shall examine the merits and defects of the proposed system as applied to it  let us suppose in some large manufacturing town ten or twelve of the most intelligent and skilful workmen to unite whose characters for sobriety and steadiness are good and are well known among their own class such persons will each possess some small portion of capital; and let them join with one or two others who have raised themselves into the class of small master manufacturers and therefore possess rather a larger portion of capital let these persons after well considering the subject agree to establish a manufactory of fireirons and fenders; and let us suppose that each of the ten workmen can command forty pounds and each of the small capitalists possesses two hundred pounds thus they have a capital of l with which to commence business; and for the sake of simplifying let us further suppose the labour of each of these twelve persons to be worth two pounds a week one portion of their capital will be expended in procuring the tools necessary for their trade which we shall take at l and this must be considered as their fixed capital the remaining l must be employed as circulating capital in purchasing the iron with which their articles are made in paying the rent of their workshops and in supporting themselves and their families until some portion of it is replaced by the sale of the goods produced  now the first question to be settled is what proportion of the profit should be allowed for the use of capital and what for skill and labour? it does not seem possible to decide this question by any abstract reasoning if the capital supplied by each partner is equal all difficulty will be removed; if otherwise the proportion must be left to find its level and will be discovered by experience; and it is probable that it will not fluctuate much let us suppose it to be agreed that the capital of l shall receive the wages of one workman at the end of each week every workman is to receive one pound as wages and one pound is to be divided amongst the owners of the capital after a few weeks the returns will begin to come in; and they will soon become nearly uniform accurate accounts should be kept of every expense and of all the sales; and at the end of each week the profit should be divided a certain portion should be laid aside as a reserved fund another portion for repair of the tools and the remainder being divided into thirteen parts one of these parts would be divided amongst the capitalists and one belong to each workman thus each man would in ordinary circumstances make up his usual wages of two pounds weekly if the factory went on prosperously the wages of the men would increase; if the sales fell off they would be diminished it is important that every person employed in the establishment whatever might be the amount paid for his services whether he act as labourer or porter as the clerk who keeps the accounts or as bookkeeper employed for a few hours once a week to superintend them should receive one half of what his service is worth in fixed salary the other part varying with the success of the undertaking  in such a factory of course division of labour would be introduced some of the workmen would be constantly employed in forging the fireirons others in polishing them others in piercing and forming the fenders it would be essential that the time occupied in each process and also its expense should be well ascertained; information which would soon be obtained very precisely now if a workman should find a mode of shortening any of the processes he would confer a benefit on the whole party even if they received but a small part of the resulting profit for the promotion of such discoveries it would be desirable that those who make them should either receive some reward to be determined after a sufficient trial by a committee assembling periodically; or if they be of high importance that the discoverer should receive onehalf or twothirds of the profit resulting from them during the next year or some other determinate period as might be found expedient as the advantages of such improvements would be clear gain to the factory it is obvious that such a share might be allowed to the inventor that it would be for his interest rather to give the benefit of them to his partners than to dispose of them in any other way  the result of such arrangements in a factory would be  that every person engaged in it would have a direct interest in its prosperity; since the effect of any success or falling off would almost immediately produce a corresponding change in his own weekly receipts  every person concerned in the factory would have an immediate interest in preventing any waste or mismanagement in all the departments  the talents of all connected with it would be strongly directed to its improvement in every department  none but workmen of high character and qualifications could obtain admission into such establishments; because when any additional hands were required it would be the common interest of all to admit only the most respectable and skilful; and it would be far less easy to impose upon a dozen workmen than upon the single proprietor of a factory  when any circumstance produced a glut in the market more skill would be directed to diminishing the cost of production; and a portion of the time of the men might then be occupied in repairing and improving their tools for which a reserved fund would pay thus checking present and at the same time facilitating future production  another advantage of no small importance would be the total removal of all real or imaginary causes for combinations the workmen and the capitalist would so shade into each other would so evidently have a common interest and their difficulties and distresses would be mutually so well understood that instead of combining to oppress one another the only combination which could exist would be a most powerful union between both parties to overcome their common difficulties  one of the difficulties attending such a system is that capitalists would at first fear to embark in it imagining that the workmen would receive too large a share of the profits and it is quite true that the workmen would have a larger share than at present but at the same time it is presumed the effect of the whole system would be that the total profits of the establishment being much increased the smaller proportion allowed to capital under this system would yet be greater in actual amount than that which results to it from the larger share in the system now existing  it is possible that the present laws relating to partnerships might interfere with factories so conducted if this interference could not be obviated by confining their purchases under the proposed system to ready money it would be desirable to consider what changes in the law would be necessary to its existence and this furnishes another reason for entering into the question of limited partnerships  a difficulty would occur also in discharging workmen who behaved ill or who were not competent to their work; this would arise from their having a certain interest in the reserved fund and perhaps from their possessing a certain portion of the capital employed; but without entering into detail it may be observed that such cases might be determined on by meetings of the whole establishment; and that if the policy of the laws favoured such establishments it would scarcely be more difficult to enforce just regulations than it now is to enforce some which are unjust by means of combinations either amongst the masters or the men  some approach to this system is already practised in several trades the mode of conducting the cornish mines has already been alluded to; the payment to the crew of whaling ships is governed by this principle; the profits arising from fishing with nets on the south coast of england are thus divided onehalf the produce belongs to the owner of the boat and net; the other half is divided in equal portions between the persons using it who are also bound to assist in repairing the net when injured notes  for a detailed account of the method of working the cornish mines see a paper of mr john taylor's transactions of the geological society vol ii p chapter  on contriving machinery  the power of inventing mechanical contrivances and of combining machinery does not appear if we may judge from the frequency of its occurrence to be a difficult or a rare gift of the vast multitude of inventions which have been produced almost daily for a series of years a large part has failed from the imperfect nature of the first trials; whilst a still larger portion which had escaped the mechanical difficulties failed only because the economy of their operations was not sufficiently attended to the commissioners appointed to examine into the methods proposed for preventing the forgery of banknotes state in their report that out of one hundred and seventyeight projects communicated to the bank and to the commissioners there were only twelve of superior skill and nine which it was necessary more particularly to examine  it is however a curious circumstance that although the power of combining machinery is so common yet the more beautiful combinations are exceedingly rare those which command our admiration equally by the perfection of their effects and the simplicity of their means are found only amongst the happiest productions of genius to produce movements even of a complicated kind is not difficult there exist a great multitude of known contrivances for all the more usual purposes and if the exertion of moderate power is the end of the mechanism to be contrived it is possible to construct the whole machine upon paper and to judge of the proper strength to be given to each part as well as to the framework which supports it and also of its ultimate effect long before a single part of it has been executed in fact all the contrivance and all the improvements ought first to be represented in the drawings  on the other hand there are effects dependent upon physical or chemical properties for the determination of which no drawings will be of any use these are the legitimate objects of direct trial for example; if the ultimate result of an engine is to be that it shall impress letters on a copperplate by means of steel punches forced into it all the mechanism by which the punches and the copper are to be moved at stated intervals and brought into contact is within the province of drawing and the machinery may be arranged entirely upon paper but a doubt may reasonably spring up whether the bur that will be raised round the letter which has been already punched upon the copper may not interfere with the proper action of the punch for the letter which is to be punched next adjacent to it it may also be feared that the effect of punching the second letter if it be sufficiently near to the first may distort the form of that first figure if neither of these evils should arise still the bur produced by the punching might be expected to interfere with the goodness of the impression produced by the copperplate; and the plate itself after having all but its edge covered with figures might change its form from the unequal condensation which it must suffer in this process so as to render it very difficult to take impressions from it at all it is impossible by any drawings to solve difficulties such as these experiment alone can determine their effect such experiments having been made it is found that if the sides of the steel punch are nearly at right angles to the face of the letter the bur produced is very inconsiderable; that at the depth which is sufficient for copperplate printing no distortion of the adjacent letters takes place although those letters are placed very close to each other; that the small bur which arises may easily be scraped off; and that the copperplate is not distorted by the condensation of the metal in punching but is perfectly fit to print from after it has undergone that process  the next stage in the progress of an invention after the drawings are finished and the preliminary experiments have been made if any such should be requisite is the execution of the machine itself it can never be too strongly impressed upon the minds of those who are devising new machines that to make the most perfect drawings of every part tends essentially both to the success of the trial and to economy in arriving at the result the actual execution from working drawings is comparatively an easy task; provided always that good tools are employed and that methods of working are adopted in which the perfection of the part constructed depends less on the personal skill of the workman than upon the certainty of the method employed  the causes of failure in this stage most frequently derive their origin from errors in the preceding one; and it is sufficient merely to indicate a few of their sources they frequently arise from having neglected to take into consideration that metals are not perfectly rigid but elastic a steel cylinder of small diameter must not be regarded as an inflexible rod; but in order to ensure its perfect action as an axis it must be supported at proper intervals again the strength and stiffness of the framing which supports the mechanism must be carefully attended to it should always be recollected that the addition of superfluous matter to the immovable parts of a machine produces no additional momentum and therefore is not accompanied with the same evil that arises when the moving parts are increased in weight the stiffness of the framing in a machine produces an important advantage if the bearings of the axis those places at which they are supported are once placed in a straight line they will remain so if the framing be immovable; whereas if the framework changes its form though ever so slightly considerable friction is immediately produced this effect is so well understood in the districts where spinning factories are numerous that in estimating the expense of working a new factory it is allowed that five per cent on the power of the steamengine will be saved if the building is fireproof for the greater strength and rigidity of a fireproof building prevents the movement of the long shafts or axes which drive the machinery from being impeded by the friction that would arise from the slightest deviation in any of the bearings  in conducting experiments upon machinery it is quite a mistake to suppose that any imperfect mechanical work is good enough for such a purpose if the experiment is worth making it ought to be tried with all the advantages of which the state of mechanical art admits; for an imperfect trial may cause an idea to be given up which better workmanship might have proved to be practicable on the other hand when once the efficiency of a contrivance has been established with good workmanship it will be easy afterwards to ascertain the degree of perfection which will suffice for its due action  it is partly owing to the imperfection of the original trials and partly to the gradual improvements in the art of making machinery that many inventions which have been tried and given up in one state of art have at another period been eminently successful the idea of printing by means of moveable types had probably suggested itself to the imagination of many persons conversant with impressions taken either from blocks or seals we find amongst the instruments discovered in the remains of pompeii and herculaneum stamps for words formed out of one piece of metal and including several letters the idea of separating these letters and of recombining them into other words for the purpose of stamping a book could scarcely have failed to occur to many but it would almost certainly have been rejected by those best acquainted with the mechanical arts of that time; for the workmen of those days must have instantly perceived the impossibility of producing many thousand pieces of wood or metal fitting so perfectly and ranging so uniformly as the types or blocks of wood now used in the art of printing the principle of the press which bears the name of bramah was known about a century and a half before the machine to which it gave rise existed; but the imperfect state of mechanical art in the time of the discoverer would have effectually deterred him if the application of it had occurred to his mind from attempting to employ it in practice as an instrument for exerting force these considerations prove the propriety of repeating at the termination of intervals during which the art of making machinery has received any great improvement the trails of methods which although founded upon just principles had previously failed  when the drawings of a machine have been properly made and the parts have been well executed and even when the work it produces possesses all the qualities which were anticipated still the invention may fail; that is it may fail of being brought into general practice this will most frequently arise from the circumstance of its producing its work at a greater expense than that at which it can be made by other methods  whenever the new or improved machine is intended to become the basis of a manufacture it is essentially requisite that the whole expense attending its operations should be fully considered before its construction is undertaken it is almost always very difficult to make this estimate of the expense the more complicated the mechanism the less easy is the task; and in cases of great complexity and extent of machinery it is almost impossible it has been estimated roughly that the first individual of any newly invented machine will cost about five times as much as the construction of the second an estimate which is perhaps sufficiently near the truth if the second machine is to be precisely like the first the same drawings and the same patterns will answer for it; but if as usually happens some improvements have been suggested by the experience of the first these must be more or less altered when however two or three machines have been completed and many more are wanted they can usually be produced at much less than onefifth of the expense of the original invention  the arts of contriving of drawing and of executing do not usually reside in their greatest perfection in one individual; and in this as in other arts the division of labour must be applied the best advice which can be offered to a projector of any mechanical invention is to employ a respectable draughtsman; who if he has had a large experience in his profession will assist in finding out whether the contrivance is new and can then make working drawings of it the first step however the ascertaining whether the contrivance has the merit of novelty is most important; for it is a maxim equally just in all the arts and in every science that the man who aspires to fortune or to fame by new discoveries must be content to examine with care the knowledge of his contemporaries or to exhaust his efforts in inventing again what he will most probably find has been better executed before  this nevertheless is a subject upon which even ingenious men are often singularly negligent there is perhaps no trade or profession existing in which there is so much quackery so much ignorance of the scientific principles and of the history of their own art with respect to its resources and extent as are to be met with amongst mechanical projectors the selfconstituted engineer dazzled with the beauty of some perhaps really original contrivance assumes his new profession with as little suspicion that previous instruction that thought and painful labour are necessary to its successful exercise as does the statesman or the senator much of this false confidence arises from the improper estimate which is entertained of the difficulty of invention in mechanics it is therefore of great importance to the individuals and to the families of those who are too often led away from more suitable pursuits the dupes of their own ingenuity and of the popular voice to convince both them and the public that the power of making new mechanical combinations is a possession common to a multitude of minds and that the talents which it requires are by no means of the highest order it is still more important that they should be impressed with the conviction that the great merit and the great success of those who have attained to eminence in such matters was almost entirely due to the unremitted perseverance with which they concentrated upon their successful inventions the skill and knowledge which years of study had matured  chapter  proper circumstances for the application of machinery  the first object of machinery the chief cause of its extensive utility is the perfection and the cheap production of the articles which it is intended to make whenever it is required to produce a great multitude of things all of exactly the same kind the proper time has arrived for the construction of tools or machines by which they may be manufactured if only a few pairs of cotton stockings should be required it would be an absurd waste of time and of capital to construct a stockingframe to weave them when for a few pence four steel wires can be procured by which they may be knit if on the other hand many thousand pairs were wanted the time employed and the expense incurred in constructing a stockingframe would be more than repaid by the saving of time in making that large number of stockings the same principle is applicable to the copying of letters if three or four copies only are required the pen and the human hand furnish the cheapest means of obtaining them; if hundreds are called for lithography may be brought to our assistance; but if hundreds of thousands are wanted the machinery of a printing establishment supplies the most economical method of accomplishing the object  there are however many cases in which machines or tools must be made in which economical production is not the most important object whenever it is required to produce a few articles parts of machinery for instance which must be executed with the most rigid accuracy or be perfectly alikeit is nearly impossible to fulfil this condition even with the aid of the most skilful hands and it becomes necessary to make tools expressly for the purpose although those tools should as frequently happens cost more in constructing than the things they are destined to make  another instance of the just application of machinery even at an increased expense arises where the shortness of time in which the article is produced has an important influence on its value in the publication of our daily newspapers it frequently happens that the debates in the houses of parliament are carried on to three and four o'clock in the morning that is to within a very few hours of the time for the publication of the paper the speeches must be taken down by reporters conveyed by them to the establishment of the newspaper perhaps at the distance of one or two miles transcribed by them in the office set up by the compositor the press corrected and the paper be printed off and distributed before the public can read them some of these journals have a circulation of from five to ten thousand daily supposing four thousand to be wanted and that they could be printed only at the rate of five hundred per hour upon one side of the paper which was the greatest number two journeymen and a boy could take off by the old hand presses sixteen hours would be required for printing the complete edition; and the news conveyed to the purchasers of the latest portion of the impression would be out of date before they could receive it to obviate this difficulty it was often necessary to set up the paper in duplicate and sometimes when late in triplicate but the improvements in the printing machines have been so great that four thousand copies are now printed on one side in an hour  the establishment of 'the times' newspaper is an example on a large scale of a manufactory in which the division of labour both mental and bodily is admirably illustrated and in which also the effect of domestic economy is well exemplified it is scarcely imagined by the thousands who read that paper in various quarters of the globe what a scene of organized activity the factory presents during the whole night or what a quantity of talent and mechanical skill is put in action for their amusement and information * nearly a hundred persons are employed in this establishment; and during the session of parliament at least twelve reporters are constantly attending the houses of commons and lords; each in his turn retiring after about an hour's work to translate into ordinary writing the speech he has just heard and noted in shorthand in the meantime fifty compositors are constantly at work some of whom have already set up the beginning whilst others are committing to type the yet undried manuscript of the continuation of a speech whose middle portion is travelling to the office in the pocket of the hasty reporter and whose eloquent conclusion is perhaps at that very moment making the walls of st stephen's vibrate with the applause of its hearers these congregated types as fast as they are composed are passed in portions to other hands; till at last the scattered fragments of the debate forming when united with the ordinary matter eightandforty columns reappear in regular order on the platform of the printingpress the hand of man is now too slow for the demands of his curiosity but the power of steam comes to his assistance ink is rapidly supplied to the moving types by the most perfect mechanism; four attendants incessantly introduce the edges of large sheets of white paper to the junction of two great rollers which seem to devour them with unsated appetite; other rollers convey them to the type already inked and having brought them into rapid and successive contact redeliver them to four other assistants completely printed by the almost momentary touch thus in one hour four thousand sheets of paper are printed on one side; and an impression of twelve thousand copies from above three hundred thousand moveable pieces of metal is produced for the public in six hours  the effect of machinery in printing other periodical publications and of due economy in distributing them is so important for the interests of knowledge that it is worth examining by what means it is possible to produce them at the small price at which they are sold 'chambers' journal' which is published at edinburgh and sold at three halfpence a number will furnish an example soon after its commencement in the sale in scotland reached and in order to supply the demand in london it was reprinted; but on account of the expense of 'composition' it was found that this plan would not produce any profit and the london edition was about to be given up when it occurred to the proprietor to stereotype it at edinburgh and cast two copies of the plates this is now done about three weeks before the day of publicationone set of plates being sent up to london by the mail an impression is printed off by steam the london agent has then time to send packages by the cheapest conveyances to several of the large towns and other copies go through the booksellers' parcels to all the smaller towns thus a great saving is effected in the outlay of capital and copies are conveyed from london as a centre to all parts of england whilst there is no difficulty in completing imperfect sets nor any waste from printing more than the public demand  the conveyance of letters is another case in which the importance of saving time would allow of great expense in any new machinery for its accomplishment there is a natural limit to the speed of horses which even the greatest improvements in the breed aided by an increased perfection in our roads can never surpass; and from which perhaps we are at present not very remote when we reflect upon the great expense of time and money which the last refinements of a theory or an art usually require it is not unreasonable to suppose that the period has arrived in which the substitution of machinery for such purposes ought to be tried  the post bag despatched every evening by the mail to one of our largest cities bristol usually weighs less than a hundred pounds now the first reflection which naturally presents itself is that in order to transport these letters a hundred and twenty miles a coach and apparatus weighing above thirty hundredweight are put in motion and also conveyed over the same space * it is obvious that amongst the conditions of machinery for accomplishing such an object it would be desirable to reduce the weight of matter to be conveyed along with the letters it would also be desirable to reduce the velocity of the animal power employed; because the faster a horse is driven the less weight he can draw amongst the variety of contrivances which might be imagined for this purpose we will mention one which although by no means free from objections fulfils some of the prescribed conditions; and it is not a purely theoretical speculation since some few experiments have been made upon it though on an extremely limited scale  let us imagine a series of high pillars erected at frequent intervals perhaps every hundred feet and as nearly as possible in a straight line between two post towns an iron or steel wire must be stretched over proper supports fixed on each of these pillars and terminating at the end of every three or five miles as may be found expedient in a very strong support by which it may be stretched at each of these latter points a man ought to reside in a small stationhouse a narrow cylindrical tin case to contain the letters might be suspended by two wheels rolling upon this wire; the cases being so constructed as to enable the wheels to pass unimpeded by the fixed supports of the wire an endless wire of much smaller size must pass over two drums one at each end of the station this wire should be supported on rollers fixed to the supports of the great wire and at a short distance below it there would thus be two branches of the smaller wire always accompanying the larger one; and the attendant at either station by turning the drum might cause them to move with great velocity in opposite directions in order to convey the cylinder which contains the letters it would only be necessary to attach it by a string or by a catch to either of the branches of the endless wire thus it would be conveyed speedily to the next station where it would be removed by the attendant to the commencement of the next wire and so forwarded it is unnecessary to enter into the details which this or any similar plan would require the difficulties are obvious; but if these could be overcome it would present many advantages besides velocity; for if an attendant resided at each station the additional expense of having two or three deliveries of letters every day and even of sending expresses at any moment would be comparatively trifling; nor is it impossible that the stretched wire might itself be available for a species of telegraphic communication yet more rapid perhaps if the steeples of churches properly selected were made use of connecting them by a few intermediate stations with some great central building as for instance with the top of st paul's; and if a similar apparatus were placed on the top of each steeple with a man to work it during the day it might be possible to diminish the expense of the twopenny post and make deliveries every half hour over the greater part of the metropolis  the power of steam however bids fair almost to rival the velocity of these contrivances; and the fitness of its application to the purposes of conveyance particularly where great rapidity is required begins now to be generally admitted the following extract from the report of the committee of the house of commons on steamcarriages explains clearly its various advantages perhaps one of the principal advantages resulting from the use of steam will be that it may be employed as cheaply at a quick as at a slow rate; 'this is one of the advantages over horse labour which becomes more and more expensive as the speed is increased there is every reason to expect that in the end the rate of travelling by steam will be much quicker than the utmost speed of travelling by horses; in short the safety to travellers will become the limit to speed' in horsedraught the opposite result takes place; 'in all cases horses lose power of draught in a much greater proportion than they gain speed and hence the work they do becomes more expensive as they go quicker' without increase of cost then we shall obtain a power which will insure a rapidity of internal communication far beyond the utmost speed of horses in draught; and although the performance of these carriages may not have hitherto attained this point when once it has been established that at equal speed we can use steam more cheaply in draught than horses we may fairly anticipate that every day's increased experience in the management of the engines will induce greater skill greater confidence and greater speed the cheapness of the conveyance will probably be for some time a secondary consideration if at present it can be used as cheaply as horse power the competition with the former modes of conveyance will first take place as to speed when once the superiority of steamcarriages shall have been fully established competition will induce economy in the cost of working them the evidence however of mr macneill shewing the greater efficiency with diminished expenditure of fuel by locomotive engines on railways convinces the committee that experience will soon teach a better construction of the engines and a less costly mode of generating the requisite supply of steam nor are the advantages of steampower confined to the greater velocity attained or to its greater cheapness than horsedraught in the latter danger is increased in as large a proportion as expense by greater speed in steampower on the contrary 'there is no danger of being run away with and that of being overturned is greatly diminished it is difficult to control four such horses as can draw a heavy carriage ten miles per hour in case they are frightened or choose to run away; and for quick travelling they must be kept in that state of courage that they are always inclined for running away particularly down hills and at sharp turns of the road in steam however there is little corresponding danger being perfectly controllable and capable of exerting its power in reverse in going down hills every witness examined has given the fullest and most satisfactory evidence of the perfect control which the conductor has over the movement of the carriage with the slightest exertion it can be stopped or turned under circumstances where horses would be totally unmanageable  another instance may be mentioned in which the object to be obtained is so important that although it might be rarely wanted yet machinery for that purpose would justify considerable expense a vessel to contain men and to be navigated at some distance below the surface of the sea would in many circumstances be almost invaluable such a vessel evidently could not be propelled by any engine requiring the aid of fire if however by condensing air into a liquid and carrying it in that state a propelling power could be procured sufficient for moving the vessel through a considerable space the expense would scarcely render its occasional employment impossible*  slide of alpnach amongst the forests which flank many of the lofty mountains of switzerland some of the finest timber is found in positions almost inaccessible the expense of roads even if it were possible to make them in such situations would prevent the inhabitants from deriving any advantages from these almost inexhaustible supplies placed by nature at a considerable elevation above the spot at which they can be made use of they are precisely in fit circumstances for the application of machinery to their removal; and the inhabitants avail themselves of the force of gravity to relieve them from some portion of this labour the inclined planes which they have established in various forests by which the timber has been sent down to the water courses have excited the admiration of every traveller; and in addition to the merit of simplicity the construction these slides requires scarcely anything beyond the material which grows upon the spot of all these specimens of carpentry the slide of alpnach was the most considerable from its great length and from the almost inaccessible position from which it descended the following account of it is taken from gilbert's annalen which is translated in the second volume of brewster's journal for many centuries the rugged flanks and the deep gorges of mount pilatus were covered with impenetrable forests; which were permitted to grow and to perish without being of the least utility to man till a foreigner who had been conducted into their wild recesses in the pursuit of the chamois directed the attention of several swiss gentlemen to the extent and superiority of the timber the most skilful individuals however considered it quite impracticable to avail themselves of such inaccessible stores it was not till the end of that m rupp and three swiss gentlemen entertaining more sanguine hopes purchased a certain extent of the forests and began the construction of the slide which was completed in the spring of  the slide of alpnach is formed entirely of about large pine trees deprived of their bark and united together in a very ingenious manner without the aid of iron it occupied about workmen during eighteen months and cost nearly francs or l it is about three leagues or english feet long and terminates in the lake of lucerne it has the form of a trough about six feet broad and from three to six feet deep its bottom is formed of three trees the middle one of which has a groove cut out in the direction of its length for receiving small rills of water which are conducted into it from various places for the purpose of diminishing the friction the whole of the slide is sustained by about supports; and in many places it is attached in a very ingenious manner to the rugged precipices of granite the direction of the slide is sometimes straight and sometimes zigzag with an inclination of from degrees to degrees it is often carried along the sides of hills and the flanks of precipitous rocks and sometimes passes over their summits occasionally it goes under ground and at other times it is conducted over the deep gorges by scaffoldings feet in height the boldness which characterizes this work the sagacity and skill displayed in all its arrangements have excited the wonder of every person who has seen it before any step could be taken in its erection it was necessary to cut several thousand trees to obtain a passage through the impenetrable thickets all these difficulties however were surmounted and the engineer had at last the satisfaction of seeing the trees descend from the mountain with the rapidity of lightning the larger pines which were about a hundred feet long and ten inches thick at their smaller extremity ran through the space of three leagues or nearly nine miles in two minutes and a half and during their descent they appeared to be only a few feet in length the arrangements for this part of the operation were extremely simple from the lower end of the slide to the upper end where the trees were introduced workmen were posted at regular distances and as soon as everything was ready the workman at the lower end of the slide cried out to the one above him 'lachez' let go the cry was repeated from one to another and reached the top of the slide in three minutes the workmen at the top of the slide then cried out to the one below him 'il vient' it comes and the tree was instantly launched down the slide preceded by the cry which was repeated from post to post as soon as the tree had reached the bottom and plunged into the lake the cry of lachez was repeated as before and a new tree was launched in a similar manner by these means a tree descended every five or six minutes provided no accident happened to the slide which sometimes took place but which was instantly repaired when it did in order to shew the enormous force which the trees acquired from the great velocity of their descent m rupp made arrangements for causing some of the trees to spring from the slide they penetrated by their thickest extremities no less than from eighteen to twentyfour feet into the earth; and one of the trees having by accident struck against another it instantly cleft it through its whole length as if it had been struck by lightning after the trees had descended the slide they were collected into rafts upon the lake and conducted to lucerne from thence they descended the reuss then the aar to near brugg afterwards to waldshut by the rhine then to basle and even to the sea when it was necessary it is to be regretted that this magnificent structure no longer exists and that scarcely a trace of it is to be seen upon the flanks of mount pilatus political circumstances having taken away the principal source of demand for the timber and no other market having been found the operation of cutting and transporting the trees necessarily ceased* professor playfair who visited this singular work states that six minutes was the usual time occupied in the descent of a tree; but that in wet weather it reached the lake in three minutes notes  the author of these pages with one of his friends was recently induced to visit this most interesting establishment after midnight during the progress of a very important debate the place was illuminated with gas and was light as the day there was neither noise nor bustle; and the visitors were received with such calm and polite attention that they did not until afterwards become sensible of the inconvenience which such intruders at a moment of the greatest pressure must occasion nor reflect tha the tranquility which they admired was the result of intense and regulated occupation but the effect of such checks in the current of business will appear on recollecting that as four thousand newspapers are printed off on one side within the hour every minute is attended with a loss of sixtysix impressions the quarter of an hour therefore which the stranger may think it not unreasonable to claim for the gratification of his curiosity and to him this time is but a moment may cause a failure in the delivery of a thousand copies and disappoint a proportionate number of expectant readers in some of our distant towns to which the morning papers are dispatched by the earliest and most rapid conveyances of each day this note is inserted with the further and more general purpose of calling the attention of those especially foreigners who are desirous of inspecting our larger manufactories to the chief cause of the difficulty which frequently attends their introduction when the establishment is very extensive and its departments skilfully arranged the exclusion of visitors arises not from any illiberal jealousy nor generally from any desire of concealment which would in most cases be absurd but from the substantial inconvenience and loss of time throughout an entire series of wellcombined operations which must be occasioned even by short and causual interruptions  it is true that the transport of letters is not the only object which this apparatus answers; but the transport of passengers which is a secondary object does in fact put a limit to the velocity of that of the letters which is the primary one  a proposal for such a vessel

adjacent mountains by a slide similar to that of alpnach it was constructed by m floresi a gentleman well acquainted with switzerland  chapter  on the duration of machinery  the time during which a machine will continue to perform its work effectually will depend chiefly upon the perfection with which it was originally constructed upon the care taken to keep it in proper repair particularly to correct every shake or looseness in the axesand upon the smallness of the mass and of the velocity of its moving parts everything approaching to a blow all sudden change of direction is injurious engines for producing power such as windmills watermills and steamengines usually last a long time*  many of the improvements which have taken place in steamengines have arisen from an improved construction of the boiler or the fireplace the following table of the work done by steamengines in cornwall whilst it proves the importance of constantly measuring the effects of machinery shows also the gradual advance which has been made in the art of constructing and managing those engines  a table of the duty performed by steamengines in cornwall shewing the average of the whole for each year and also the average duty of the best engine in each monthly report years; approximate number of engines reported; average duty of the whole; average duty of the best engines  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ;

cornwall has been so great that the proprietors of one of the largest mines on which there are several engines find it good economy to employ a man to measure the duty they perform every day this daily report is fixed up at a particular hour and the enginemen are always in waiting anxious to know the state of their engines as the general reports are made monthly if accident should cause a partial stoppage in the flue of any of the boilers it might without this daily check continue two or three weeks before it could be discovered by a falling off of the duty of the engine in several of the mines a certain amount of duty is assigned to each engine; and if it does more the proprietors give a premium to the engineers according to its amount this is called million money and is a great stimulus to economy in working the engine  machinery for producing any commodity in great demand seldom actually wears out; new improvements by which the same operations can be executed either more quickly or better generally superseding it long before that period arrives indeed to make such an improved machine profitable it is usually reckoned that in five years it ought to have paid itself and in ten to be superseded by a better 'a cotton manufacturer' says one of the witnesses before a committee of the house of commons 'who left manchester seven years ago would be driven out of the market by the men who are now living in it provided his knowledge had not kept pace with those who have been during that time constantly profiting by the progressive improvements that have taken place in that period'  the effect of improvements in machinery seems incidentally to increase production through a cause which may be thus explained a manufacturer making the usual profit upon his capital invested in looms or other machines in perfect condition the market price of making each of which is a hundred pounds invents some improvement but this is of such a nature that it cannot be adapted to his present engines he finds upon calculation that at the rate at which he can dispose of his manufactured produce each new engine would repay the cost of its making together with the ordinary profit of capital in three years he also concludes from his experience of the trade that the improvement he is about to make will not be generally adopted by other manufacturers before that time on these considerations it is clearly his interest to sell his present engines even at halfprice and construct new ones on the improved principle but the purchaser who gives only fifty pounds for the old engines has not so large a fixed capital invested in his factory as the person from whom he purchased them; and as he produces the same quantity of the manufactured article his profits will be larger hence the price of the commodity will fall not only in consequence of the cheaper production by the new machines but also by the more profitable working of the old thus purchased at a reduced price this change however can be only transient; for a time will arrive when the old machinery although in good repair must become worthless the improvement which took place not long ago in frames for making patentnet was so great that a machine in good repair which had cost l sold a few years after for l during the great speculations in that trade the improvements succeeded each other so rapidly that machines which had never been finished were abandoned in the hands of their makers because new improvements had superseded their utility  the durability of watches when well made is very remarkable one was produced in going order before a committee of the house of commons to enquire into the watch trade which was made in the year ; and there are many of ancient date in the possession of the clockmaker's company which are still actually kept going the number of watches manufactured for home consumption was in the year about annually if this supply was for great britain only it was consumed by about ten and a half millions of persons  machines are in some trades let out to hire and a certain sum is paid for their use; in the manner of rent this is the case amongst the framework knitters and mr henson in speaking of the rate of payment for the use of their frames states that the proprietor receives such a rent that besides paying the full interest for his capital he clears the value of his frame in nine years when the rapidity with which improvements succeed each other is considered this rent does not appear exorbitant some of these frames have been worked for thirteen years with little or no repair but circumstances occasionally arise which throw them out of employment either temporarily or permanently some years since an article was introduced called cutup work by which the price of stockingframes was greatly deteriorated from the evidence of mr j rawson it appears that in consequence of this change in the nature of the work each frame could do the work of two and many stocking frames were thrown out of employment and their value reduced full threefourths* this information is of great importance if the numbers here given are nearly correct and if no other causes intervened to diminish the price of frames; for it shews the numerical connection between the increased production of those machines and their diminished value  the great importance of simplifying all transactions between masters and workmen and of dispassionately discussing with the latter the influence of any proposed regulations connected with their trade is well examplified by a mistake into which both parties unintentionally fell and which was productive of very great misery in the lace trade its history is so well told by william allen a framework knitter who was a party to it that an extract from his evidence as given before the framework knitters' committee of will best explain it i beg to say a few words respecting the frame rent; the rent paid for lace frames until the year was s d a frame per week; there then was not any very great inducement for persons to buy frames and let them out by the hire who did not belong to the trade; at that time an attempt was made by one or two houses to reduce the prices paid to the workmen in consequence of a dispute between these two houses and another great house some little difference being paid in the price amongst the respective houses i was one chosen by the workmen to try if we could not remedy the impending evil we consulted the respective parties and found them inflexible; these two houses that were about to reduce the prices said that they would either immediately reduce the price of making net or they would increase the frame rent the difference to the workmen was considerable between the one and the other; they would suffer less in the immediate operation of the thing by having the rent advanced than the price of making net reduced they chose at that time as they thought the lesser evil but it has turned out to be otherwise; for immediately as the rent was raised upon the percentage laid out in frames it induced almost every person who had got a little money to lay it out in the purchase of frames; these frames were placed in the hands of men who could get work for them at the warehouses; they were generally constrained to pay an enormous rent and then they were compelled most likely to buy of the persons that let them the frames their butcher's meat their grocery or their clothing the encumbrance of these frames became entailed upon them if any deadness took place in the work they must take it at a very reduced price for fear of the consequences that would fall upon them from the person who bought the frame thus the evil has been daily increasing till in conjunction with the other evils crept into the trade they have almost crushed it to atoms  the evil of not assigning fairly to each tool or each article produced its proportionate value or even of not having a perfectly distinct simple and definite agreement between a master and his workmen is very considerable workmen find it difficult in such cases to know the probable produce of their labour; and both parties are often led to adopt arrangements which had they been well examined would have been rejected as equally at variance in the results with the true interests of both  at birmingham stamps and dies and presses for a great variety of articles are let out they are generally made by men possessing small capital and are rented by workmen power also is rented at the same place steamengines are erected in large buildings containing a variety of rooms in which each person may hire one two or any other amount of horsepower as his occupation may require if any mode could be discovered of transmitting power without much loss from friction to considerable distances and at the same time of registering the quantity made use of at any particular point a considerable change would probably take place in many departments of the present system of manufacturing a few central engines to produce power might then be erected in our great towns and each workman hiring a quantity of power sufficient for his purpose might have it conveyed into his own house; and thus a transition might in some instances be effected if it should be found more profitable back again from the system of great factories to that of domestic manufacture  the transmission of water through a series of pipes might be employed for the distribution of power but the friction would consume a considerable portion another method has been employed in some instances and is practised at the mint it consists in exhausting the air from a large vessel by means of a steamengine this vessel is connected by pipes with a small piston which drives each coining press; and on opening a valve the pressure of the external air forces in the piston this air is then admitted to the general reservoir and pumped out by the engine the condensation of air might be employed for the same purpose; but there are some unexplained facts relating to elastic fluids which require further observations and experiment before they can be used for the conveyance of power to any considerable distance it has been found for instance in attempting to blow a furnace by means of a powerful waterwheel driving air through a castiron pipe of above a mile in length that scarcely any sensible effect was produced at the opposite extremity in one instance some accidental obstruction being suspected a cat put in at one end found its way out without injury at the other thus proving that the phenomenon did not depend on interruption within the pipe  the most portable form in which power can be condensed is perhaps by the liquefaction of the gases it is known that under considerable pressure several of these become liquid at ordinary temperatures; carbonic acid for example is reduced to a liquid state by a pressure of sixty atmospheres one of the advantages attending the use of these fluids would be that the pressure exerted by them would remain constant until the last drop of liquid had assumed the form of gas if either of the elements of common air should be found to be capable of reduction to a liquid state before it unites into a corrosive fluid with the other ingredient then we shall possess a ready means of conveying power in any quantity and to any distance hydrogen probably will require the strongest compressing force to render it liquid and may therefore possibly be applied where still greater condensation of power is wanted in all these cases the condensed gases may be looked upon as springs of enormous force which have been wound up by the exertion of power and which will deliver the whole of it back again when required these springs of nature differ in some respects from the steel springs formed by our art; for in the compression of the natural springs a vast quantity of latent heat is forced out and in their return to the state of gas an equal quantity is absorbed may not this very property be employed with advantage in their application? part of the mechanical difficulty to be overcome in constructing apparatus connected with liquefied gases will consist in the structure of the valves and packing necessary to retain the fluids under the great pressure to which they must be submitted the effect of heat on these gases has not yet been sufficiently tried to lead us to any very precise notions of the additional power which its application to them will supply the elasticity of air is sometimes employed as a spring instead of steel in one of the large printingmachines in london the momentum of a considerable mass of matter is destroyed by making it condense the air included in a cylinder by means of a piston against which it impinges  the effect of competition in cheapening articles of manufacture sometimes operates in rendering them less durable when such articles are conveyed to a distance for consumption if they are broken it often happens from the price of labour being higher where they are used than where they were made that it is more expensive to mend the old article than to purchase a new such is usually the case in great cities with some of the commoner locks with hinges and with a variety of articles of hardware notes  the amount of obstructions arising from the casual fixing of trees in the bottom of the river may be estimated from the proportion of steamboats destroyed by running upon them the subjoined statement is taken from the american almanack for  'between the years and three hundred and fortyeight steamboats were built on the mississippi and its tributary streams during that period a hundred and fifty were lost or worn out 'of this hundred and fifty   worn out     lost by snags    burnt      lost by collision   by accidents   not ascertained thirtysix or nearly one fourth being destroyed by accidental obstructions snag is the name given in america to trees which stand nearly upright in the stream with their roots fixed at the bottom it is usual to divide off at the bow of the steamboats a watertight chamber in order that when a hole is made in it by running against the snags the water may not enter the rest of the vessel and sink it instantly  this passage is not printed in italics in the original but it has been thus marked in the above extract from its importance and from the conviction that the most extended discussion will afford additional evidence of its truth  report from the committee of the house of commons on the framework knitter's petition april chapter  on combinations amongst masters or workmen against each other  there exist amongst the workmen of almost all classes certain rules or laws which govern their actions towards each other and towards their employers but besides these general principles there are frequently others peculiar to each factory which have derived their origin in many instances from the mutual convenience of the parties engaged in them such rules are little known except to those actually pursuing the several trades; and as it is of importance that their advantages and disadvantages should be canvassed we shall offer a few remarks upon some of them  the principles by which such laws should be tried are first that they conduce to the general benefit of all the persons employed secondly that they prevent fraud thirdly that they interfere as little as possible with the free agency of each individual  it is usual in many workshops that on the first entrance of a new journeyman he shall pay a small fine to the rest of the men it is clearly unjust to insist upon this payment; and when it is spent in drinking which is unfortunately too often the case it is injurious the reason assigned for the demand is that the newcomer will require some instruction in the habits of the shop and in the places of the different tools and will thus waste the time of some of his companions until he is instructed if this fine were added to a fund managed by the workmen themselves and either divided at given periods or reserved for their relief in sickness it would be less objectionable since its tendency would be to check the too frequent change of men from one shop to another but it ought at all events not to be compulsory and the advantages to be derived from the fund to which the workman is invited to subscribe ought to be his sole inducement to contribute  in many workshops the workmen although employed on totally different parts of the objects manufactured are yet dependent in some measure upon each other thus a single smith may be able to forge in one day work enough to keep four or five turners employed during the next if from idleness or intemperance the smith neglects his work and does not furnish the usual supply the turners supposing them to be paid by the piece will have their time partly unoccupied and their gains consequently diminished it is reasonable in such circumstances that a fine should be levied on the delinquent; but it is desirable that the master should have concurred with his workmen in establishing such a rule and that it should be shown to each individual previously to his engagement; and it is very desirable that such fine should not be spent in drinking  in some establishments it is customary for the master to give a small gratuity whenever any workman has exercised a remarkable degree of skill or has economized the material employed thus in splitting horn into layers for lanterns one horn usually furnishes from five to eight layers; but if a workman split the horn into ten layers or more he receives a pint of ale from the master these premiums should not be too high lest the material should be wasted in unsuccessful attempts but such regulations when judiciously made are beneficial as they tend to produce skill amongst the workmen profit to the masters and diminished cost to the consumers  in some few factories in which the men are paid by the piece it is usual when any portion of work delivered in by a workman is rejected by the master on account of its being badly executed to fine the delinquent such a practice tends to remedy one of the evils attendant upon that mode of payment and greatly assists the master since his own judgement is thus supported by competent and unprejudiced judges  societies exist amongst some of the larger bodies of workmen and others have been formed by the masters engaged in the same branches of trade these associations have different objects in view; but it is very desirable that their effects should be well understood by the individuals who compose them; and that the advantages arising from them which are certainly great should be separated as much as possible from the evils which they have unfortunately too frequently introduced associations of workmen and of masters may with advantage agree upon rules to be observed by both parties in estimating the proportionate value of different kinds of work executed in their trade in order that time may be saved and disputes be prevented they may also be most usefully employed in acquiring accurate information as to the number of persons working in the various departments of any manufacture their rate of wages the number of machines in use and other statistical details information of this nature is highly valuable both for the guidance of the parties who are themselves most interested and to enable them upon any application to government for assistance or with a view to legislative enactments to supply those details without which the propriety of any proposed measure cannot be duly estimated such details may be collected by men actually engaged in any branch of trade at a much smaller expense of time than by persons less acquainted with and less interested in it  one of the most legitimate and most important objects of such associations as we have just mentioned is to agree upon ready and certain modes of measuring the quantity of work done by the workmen for a long time a difficulty upon this point existed in the lace trade which was justly complained of by the men as a serious grievance; but the introduction of the rack which counts the number of holes in the length of the piece has entirely put an end to the most fertile cause of disputes this invention was adverted to by the committee of and a hope was expressed in their report that the same contrivance would be applied to stockingframes it would indeed be of great mutual advantage to the industrious workman and to the master manufacturer in every trade if the machines employed in it could register the quantity of work which they perform in the same manner as a steamengine does the number of strokes it makes the introduction of such contrivances gives a greater stimulus to honest industry than can readily be imagined and removes one of the sources of disagreement between parties whose real interests must always suffer by any estrangement between them  the effects arising from combinations amongst the workmen are almost always injurious to the parties themselves there are numerous instances in which the public suffer by increased price at the moment but are ultimately gainers from the permanent reduction which results; whilst on the other hand the improvements which are often made in machinery in consequence of 'a strike' amongst the workmen most frequently do injury of greater or less duration to that particular class which gave rise to them as the injury to the men and to their families is almost always more serious than that which affects their employers it is of the utmost importance to the comfort and happiness of the former class that they should themselves entertain sound views upon this question for this purpose a few illustrations of the principle which is here maintained will probably have greater weight than any reasoning of a more general nature though drawn from admitted principles of political economy such instances will moreover present the advantage of appealing to facts known to many individuals of those classes for whose benefit these reflections are intended  there is a process in the manufacture of gun barrels for making what in the language of the trade are called skelps the skelp is a piece or bar of iron about three feet long and four inches wide but thicker and broader at one end than at the other; and the barrel of a musket is formed by forging out such pieces to the proper dimensions and then folding or bending them into a cylindrical form until the edges overlap so that they can be welded together about twenty years ago the workmen employed at a very extensive factory in forging these skelps out of bariron 'struck' for an advance of wages; and as their demands were very exorbitant they were not immediately complied with in the meantime the superintendent of the establishment directed his attention to the subject; and it occurred to him that if the circumference of the rollers between which the bariron was rolled were to be made equal to the length of a skelp or of a musket barrel and if also the groove in which the iron was compressed instead of being of the same width and depth throughout were cut gradually deeper and wider from a point on the rollers until it returned to the same point then the bariron passing between such rollers instead of being uniform in width and thickness would have the form of a skelp on making the trial it was found to succeed perfectly; a great reduction of human labour was effected by the process and the workmen who had acquired peculiar skill in performing it ceased to derive any advantage from their dexterity  it is somewhat singular that another and a still more remarkable instance of the effect of combination amongst workmen should have occurred but a few years since in the very same trade the process of welding the skelps so as to convert them into gun barrels required much skill and after the termination of the war the demand for muskets having greatly diminished the number of persons employed in making them was very much reduced this circumstance rendered combination more easy; and upon one occasion when a contract had been entered into for a considerable supply to be delivered on a fixed day the men all struck for such an advance of wages as would have caused the completion of the contract to be attended with a very heavy loss in this difficulty the contractors resorted to a mode of welding the gun barrel for which a patent had been taken out by one of themselves some years before this event the plan had not then succeeded so well as to come into general use in consequence of the cheapness of the usual mode of welding by hand labour combined with some other difficulties with which the patentee had to contend but the stimulus produced by the combination of the workmen induced him to make new trials and he was enabled to introduce such a facility in welding gun barrels by rollers and such perfection in the work itself that in all probability very few will in future be welded by hand labour this new process consisted in folding a bar of iron about a foot long into the form of a cylinder with the edges a little overlapping it was then placed in a furnace and being taken out when raised to a welding heat a triblet or cylinder of iron was placed in it and the whole was passed quickly through a pair of rollers the effect of this was that the welding was performed at a single heating and the remainder of the elongation necessary for extending the skelps to the length of the musket barrel was performed in a similar manner but at a lower temperature the workmen who had combined were of course no longer wanted and instead of benefiting themselves by their combination they were reduced permanently by this improvement in the art to a considerably lower rate of wages for as the process of welding gun barrels by hand required peculiar skill and considerable experience they had hitherto been in the habit of earning much higher wages than other workmen of their class on the other hand the new method of welding was far less injurious to the texture of the iron which was now exposed only once instead of three or four times to the welding heat so that the public derived advantage from the superiority as well as from the economy of the process another process has subsequently been invented applicable to the manufacture of a lighter kind of iron tubes which can thus be made at a price which renders their employment very general they are now to be found in the shops of all our larger ironmongers of various lengths and diameters with screws cut at each end; and are in constant use for the conveyance of gas for lighting or of water for warming our houses  similar examples must have presented themselves to all those who are familiar with the details of our manufactories but these are sufficient to illustrate one of the results of combinations it would not however be fair to push the conclusion deduced from these instances to its extreme limit although it is very apparent that in the two cases which have been stated the effects of combination were permanently injurious to the workman by almost immediately placing him in a lower class with respect to his wages than he occupied before; yet they do not prove that all such combinations have this effect it is quite evident that they have all this tendency it is also certain that considerable stimulus must be applied to induce a man to contrive a new and expensive process; and that in both these cases unless the fear of pecuniary loss had acted powerfully the improvement would not have been made if therefore the workmen had in either case combined for only a small advance of wages they would in all probability have been successful and the public would have been deprived for many years of the inventions to which these combinations gave rise it must however be observed that the same skill which enabled the men to obtain after long practice higher wages than the rest of their class would prevent many of them from being permanently thrown back into the class of ordinary workmen their diminished wages will continue only until they have acquired by practice a facility of execution in some other of the more difficult operations but a diminution of wages even for a year or two is still a very serious inconvenience to any person who lives by his daily exertion the consequence of combination has then in these instances been to the workmen who combinedreduction of wages; to the public reduction of price; and to the manufacturer increased sale of his commodity resulting from that reduction  it is however important to consider the effects of combination in another and less obvious point of view the fear of combination amongst the men whom he employs will have a tendency to induce the manufacturer to conceal from his workmen the extent of the orders he may at any time have received; and consequently they will always be less acquainted with the extent of the demand for their labour than they otherwise might be this is injurious to their interests; for instead of foreseeing by the gradual fallingoff in the orders the approach of a time when they must be unemployed and preparing accordingly they are liable to much more sudden changes than those to which they would otherwise be exposed in the evidence given by mr galloway the engineer he remarks that when employers are competent to show their men that their business is steady and certain and when men find that they are likely to have permanent employment they have always better habits and more settled notions which will make them better men and better workmen and will produce great benefits to all who are interested in their employment  as the manufacturer when he makes a contract has no security that a combination may not arise amongst the workmen which may render that contract a loss instead of a benefit; besides taking precautions to prevent them from becoming acquainted with it he must also add to the price at which he could otherwise sell the article some small increase to cover the risk of such an occurrence if an establishment consist of several branches which can only be carried on jointly as for instance of iron mines blast furnaces and a colliery in which there are distinct classes of workmen it becomes necessary to keep on hand a larger stock of materials than would be required if it were certain that no combinations would arise suppose for instance the colliers were to 'strike' for an advance of wagesunless there was a stock of coal above ground the furnaces must be stopped and the miners also would be thrown out of employ now the cost of keeping a stock of iron ore or of coals above ground is just the same as that of keeping in a drawer unemployed its value in money except indeed that the coal suffers a small deterioration by exposure to the elements the interest of this sum must therefore be considered as the price of an insurance against the risk of combination amongst the workmen; and it must so far as it goes increase the price of the manufactured article and consequently limit the demand which would otherwise exist for it but every circumstance which tends to limit the demand is injurious to the workmen; because the wider the demand the less it is exposed to fluctuation the effect to which we have alluded is by no means a theoretical conclusion; the proprietors of one establishment in the iron trade within the author's knowledge think it expedient always to keep above ground a supply of coal for six months which is in that instance equal in value to about l when we reflect that the quantity of capital throughout the country thus kept unemployed merely from the fear of combinations amongst the workmen might under other circumstances be used for keeping a larger number at work the importance of introducing a system in which there should exist no inducement to combine becomes additionally evident  that combinations are while they last productive of serious inconveniences to the workmen themselves is admitted by all parties; and it is equally true that in most cases a successful result does not leave them in so good a condition as they were in before 'the strike' the little capital they possessed which ought to have been hoarded with care for days of illness or distress is exhausted; and frequently in order to gratify a pride at the existence of which we cannot but rejoice even whilst we regret its misdirected energy they will undergo the severest privations rather than return to work at their former wages with many of the workmen unfortunately during such periods bad habits are formed which it is very difficult to eradicate; and in all those engaged in such transactions the kinder feelings of the heart are chilled and passions are called into action which are permanently injurious to the happiness of the individual and destructive of those sentiments of confidence which it is equally the interest of the master manufacturer and of his workman to maintain if any of the trade refuse to join in the strike the majority too frequently forget in the excitement of their feelings the dictates of justice and endeavour to exert a species of tyranny which can never be permitted to exist in a free country in conceding therefore to the working classes that they have a right if they consider it expedient to combine for the purpose of procuring higher wages provided always that they have completed all their existing contracts it ought ever to be kept before their attention that the same freedom which they claim for themselves they are bound to allow to others who may have different views of the advantages of combination every effort which reason and kindness can dictate should be made not merely to remove their grievances but to satisfy their own reason and feelings and to show them the consequences which will probably result from their conduct but the strong arm of the law backed as in such cases it will always be by public opinion should be instantly and unhesitatingly applied to prevent them from violating the liberty of a portion of their own or of any other class of society  amongst the evils which ultimately fall heavy on the working classes themselves when through mistaken views they attempt to interfere with their employers in the mode of carrying on their business may be mentioned the removal of factories to other situations where the proprietors may be free from the improper control of their men the removal of a considerable number of lace frames to the western counties which took place in consequence of the combinations in nottinghamshire has already been mentioned other instances have occurred where still greater injury has been produced by the removal of a portion of the skill and capital of the country to a foreign land such was the case at glasgow as stated in the fifth parliamentary report respecting artizans and machinery one of the partners in an extensive cotton factory disgusted by the unprincipled conduct of the workmen removed to the state of new york where he reestablished his machinery and thus afforded to rivals already formidable to our trade at once a pattern of our best machinery and an example of the most economical methods of employing it  when the nature of the work is such that it is not possible to remove it as happens with regard to mines the proprietors are more exposed to injury from combinations amongst the workmen but as the owners are generally possessed of a larger capital they generally succeed if the reduction of wages which they propose is really founded on the necessity of the case an extensive combination lately existed amongst the colliers in the north of england which unfortunately led in several instances to acts of violence the proprietors of the coalmines were consequently obliged to procure the aid of miners from other parts of england who were willing to work at the wages they could afford to give; and the aid of the civil and in some cases of the military power was requisite for their protection this course was persisted in during several months and the question being which party could support itself longest on the diminished gains as it might have readily been foreseen the proprietors ultimately succeeded  one of the remedies employed by the masters against the occurrence of combinations is to make engagements with their men for long periods and to arrange them in such a manner that these contracts shall not all terminate together this has been done in some cases at sheffield and in other places it is attended with the inconvenience to the masters that during periods when the demand for their produce is reduced they are still obliged to employ the same number of workmen this circumstance however frequently obliges the proprietors to direct their attention to improvements in their works and in one such instance within the author's knowledge a large reservoir was deepened thus affording a more constant supply to the waterwheel whilst at the same time the mud from the bottom gave permanent fertility to a piece of land previously almost barren in this case not merely was the supply of produce checked when a glut existed but the labour was in fact applied more profitably than it would have been in the usual course  a mode of paying the wages of workmen in articles which they consume has been introduced into some of our manufacturing districts which has been called the truck system as in many instances this has nearly the effect of a combination of the masters against the men it is a fit subject for discussion in the present chapter but it should be carefully distinguished from another system of a very different tendency which will be first described  the principal necessaries for the support of a workman and his family are few in number and are usually purchased by him in small quantities weekly upon such quantities sold by the retail dealer a large profit is generally made; and if the article is one whose quality like that of tea is not readily estimated then a great additional gain is made by the retail dealer selling an inferior article where the number of workmen living on the same spot is large it may be thought desirable that they should unite together and have an agent to purchase by wholesale those articles which are most in demand as tea suger bacon etc and to retail them at prices which will just repay the wholesale cost together with the expense of the agent who conducts their sale if this be managed wholly by a committee of workmen aided perhaps by advice from the master and if the agent is paid in such a manner as to have himself an interest in procuring good and reasonable articles it may be a benefit to the workmen and if the plan succeed in reducing the cost of articles of necessity to the men it is clearly the interest of the master to encourage it the master may indeed be enabled to afford them facilities in making their wholesale purchases; but he ought never to have the least interest in or any connection with the profit made by the articles sold the men on the other hand who subscribe to set up the shop ought not in the slightest degree to be compelled to make their purchases there the goodness and cheapness of the article ought to be their sole inducements it may perhaps be objected that this plan is only employing a portion of the capital belonging to the workmen in a retail trade; and that without it competition amongst small shopkeepers will reduce the articles to nearly the same price this objection would be valid if the objects of consumption required no verification; but combining what has been already stated on that subject* with the present argument the plan seems liable to no serious objections  the truck system is entirely different in its effects the master manufacturer keeps a retail shop for articles required by his men and either pays their wages in goods or compels them by express agreement or less directly by unfair means to expend the whole or a certain part of their wages at his shop if the manufacturer kept this shop merely for the purpose of securing good articles at fair prices to his workmen and if he offered no inducement to them to purchase at his shop except the superior cheapness of his articles it would certainly be advantageous to the men but unfortunately this is not always the case; and the temptation to the master in times of depression to reduce in effect the wages which he pays by increasing the price of articles at his shop without altering the nominal rate of payment is frequently too great to be withstood if the object be solely to procure for his workmen better articles it will be more effectually accomplished by the master confining himself to supplying a small capital at a moderate rate of interest; leaving the details to be conducted by a committee of workmen in conjunction with his own agent and the books of the shop to be audited periodically by the men themselves  wherever the workmen are paid in goods or are compelled to purchase at the master's shop much injustice is done to them and great misery results from it whatever may have been the intentions of the master in such cases the real effect is to deceive the workman as to the amount he receives in exchange for his labour now the principles on which the happiness of that class of society depends are difficult enough to be understood even by those who are blessed with far better opportunities of investigating them and the importance of their being well acquainted with those principles which relate to themselves is of more vital consequence to workmen than to many other classes it is therefore highly desirable to assist them in comprehending the position in which they are placed by rendering all the relations in which they stand to each other and to their employers as simple as possible workmen should be paid entirely in money; their work should be measured by some unbiassed some unerring piece of mechanism; the time during which they are employed should be defined and punctually adhered to the payments they make to their benefit societies should be fixed on such just principles as not to require extraordinary contributions in short the object of all who wish to promote their happiness should be to give them in the simplest form the means of knowing beforehand the sum they are likely to acquire by their labour and the money they will be obliged to expend for their support thus putting before them in the clearest light the certain result of persevering industry  the cruelty which is inflicted on the workman by the payment of his wages in goods is often very severe the little purchases necessary for the comfort of his wife and children perhaps the medicines he occasionally requires for them in illness must all be made through the medium of barter; and he is obliged to waste his time in arranging an exchange in which the goods which he has been compelled to accept for his labour are invariably taken at a lower price than that at which his master charged them to him the father of a family perhaps writhing under the agonies of the toothache is obliged to make his hasty bargain with the village surgeon before he will remove the cause of his pain; or the disconsolate mother is compelled to sacrifice her depreciated goods in exchange for the last receptacle of her departed offspring the subjoined evidence from the report of the committee of the house of commons on framework knitters' petitions shows that these are not exaggerated statements it has been so common in our town to pay goods instead of money that a number of my neighbours have been obliged to pay articles for articles to pay sugar for drugs out of the druggist's shop; and others have been obliged to pay sugar for drapery goods and such things and exchange in that way numbers of times i was credibly informed that one person paid half a pound of tenpenny sugar and a penny to have a tooth drawn; and there is a credible neighbour of mine told me that he had heard that the sexton had been paid for digging a grave with sugar and tea and before i came off knowing i had to give evidence upon these things i asked this friend to enquire of the sexton whether this was a fact the sexton hesitated for a little time on account of bringing into discredit the person who paid these goods however he said at last 'i have received these articles repeatedlyi know these things have been paid to a great extent in this way' notes  see chapter xv p chapter  on combinations of masters against the public  a species of combination occasionally takes place amongst manufacturers against persons having patents and these combinations are always injurious to the public as well as unjust to the inventors some years since a gentleman invented a machine by which modellings and carvings were cut in mahogany and other fine woods the machine resembled in some measure the drilling apparatus employed in ornamental lathes; it produced beautiful work at a very moderate expense but the cabinetmakers met together and combined against it and the patent has consequently never been worked a similar fate awaited a machine for cutting veneers by means of a species of knife in this instance the wood could be cut thinner than by the circular saw and no waste was incurred; but 'the trade' set themselves against it and after a heavy expense it was given up the excuse alleged for this kind of combination was the fear entertained by the cabinetmakers that when the public became acquainted with the article the patentee would raise the price similar examples of combination seem not to be unfrequent as appears by the report of the committee of the house of commons on patents for inventions june see the evidence of mr holdsworth  there occurs another kind of combination against the public with which it is difficult to deal it usually ends in a monopoly and the public are then left to the discretion of the monopolists not to charge them above the growling pointthat is not to make them pay so much as to induce them actually to combine against the imposition this occurs when two companies supply water or gas to consumers by means of pipes laid down under the pavement in the street of cities it may possibly occur also in docks canals railroads etc and in other cases where the capital required is very large and the competition very limited if water or gas companies combine the public immediately loses all the advantage of competition and it has generally happened that at the end of a period during which they have undersold each other the several companies have agreed to divide the whole district supplied into two or more parts each company then removing its pipes from all the streets except those in its own portion this removal causes great injury to the pavement and when the pressure of increased rates induces a new company to start the same inconvenience is again produced perhaps one remedy against evils of this kind might be when a charter is granted to such companies to restrict to a certain amount the rate of profit on the shares and to direct that any profits beyond shall accumulate for the repayment of the original capital this has been done in several late acts of parliament establishing companies the maximum rate of profit allowed ought to be liberal to compensate for the risk; the public ought to have auditors on their part and the accounts should be annually published for the purpose of preventing the limitations from being exceeded it must however be admitted that this would be an interference with capital which if allowed should in the present state of our knowledge be examined with great circumspection in each individual case until some general principle is established on welladmitted grounds  an instrument called a gasmeter which ascertains the quantity of gas used by each consumer has been introduced and furnishes a satisfactory mode of determining the payments to be made by individuals to the gas companies a contrivance somewhat similar in its nature might be used for the sale of water; but in that case some public inconvenience might be apprehended from the diminished quantity which would then run to waste the streams of water running through the sewers in london are largely supplied from this source; and if this supply were diminished the drainage of the metropolis might be injuriously affected  in the north of england a powerful combination has long existed among the coalowners by which the public has suffered in the payment of increased price the late examination of evidence before a committee of the house of commons has explained its mode of operation and the committee have recommended that for the present the sale of coal should be left to the competition of other districts  a combination of another kind exists at this moment to a great extent and operates upon the price of the very pages which are now communicating information respecting it a subject so interesting to every reader and still more so to every manufacturer ofthe article which the reader consumes deserves an attentive examination we have shown in chapter xxi p the component parts of the expense of each copy of the present work; and we have seen that the total amount of the cost of its production exclusive of any payment to the author for his labour is s d* another fact with which the reader is more practically familiar is that he has paid or is to pay to his bookseller six shillings for the volume let us now examine into the distribution of these six shillings and then having the facts ofthe case before us we shall be better able to judgeofthe meritsofthe combinationjust mentioned andtoexplainits effects  distribution of the profits on a six shilling book  buys at; sells at; profit on capital expended s d; s d no ithe publisher who accounts to the author for every copy received; ; ; per cent no iithe bookseller who retails to the public; ; ;  or ; ; no i the publisher is a bookseller; he is in fact the author's agent his duties are to receive and take charge of the stock for which he supplies warehouse room; to advise the author about the times and methods of advertising; and to insert the advertisements as he publishes other books he will advertise lists of those sold by himself; and thus by combining many in one advertisement diminish the expense to each of his principals he pays the author only for the books actually sold; consequently he makes no outlav of capital except that which he pays for advertisements but he is answerable for any bad debts he may contract in disposing of them his charge is usually ten per cent on the returns no ii is the bookseller who retails the work to the public on the publication of a new book the publisher sends round to the trade to receive 'subscriptions' from them for any number of copies not less than two these copies are usually charged to the 'subscribers' on an average at about four or five per cent less than the wholesale price of the book in the present case the subscription price is s d for each copy after the day of publication the price charged by the publisher to the booksellers is s d with some works it is the custom to deliver twentyfive copies to those who order twentyfour thus allowing a reduction of about four per cent such was the case with the present volume different publishers offer different terms to the subscribers; and it is usual after intervals of about six months for the publisher again to open a subscription list so that if the work be one for which there is a steady sale the trade avail themselves of these opportunities of purchasing at the reduced rate enough to supply their probable demand*  the volume thus purchased of the publisher at s d or s d is retailed by the bookseller to the public at s in the first case he makes a profit of fortyfour in the second of thirtythree per cent even the smaller of these two rates of profit on the capital employed appears to be much too large it may sometimes happen that when a book is enquired for the retail dealer sends across the street to the wholesale agent and receives for this trifling service one fourth part of the money paid by the purchaser; and perhaps the retail dealer takes also six months' credit for the price which the volume actually cost him  in section the price of each process in manufacturing the present volume was stated we shall now give an analysis of the whole expense of conveying it into the hands of the public  the retail price s on produces total expense of printing and paper taxes on paper and advertisements commission to publisher as agent between author and printer commission to publisher as agent for sale of the book profitthe difference between subscription price and trade price d per vol profit the difference between trade price and retail price s d per vol    remains for authorship total this account appears to disagree with that in page but it will be observed that the three first articles amount to l s the sum there stated the apparent difference arises from a circumstance which was not noticed in the first edition of this work the bill amounting to l s as there given and as reprinted in the present volume included an additional charge of ten per cent upon the real charges of the printer and papermaker  it is usual for the publisher when he is employed as agent between the author and printer to charge a commission of ten per cent on all payments he makes if the author is informed of this custom previously to his commencing the work as was the case in the present instance he can have no just cause of complaint; for it is optional whether he himself employs the printer or communicates with him through the intervention of his publisher the services rendered for this payment are the making arrangements with the printer the woodcutter and the engraver if required there is a convenience in having some intermediate person between the author and printer in case the former should consider any of the charges made by the latter as too high when the author himself is quite unacquainted with the details of the art of printing he may object to charges which on a better acquaintance with the subject he might be convinced were very moderate; and in such cases he ought to depend on the judgement of his publisher who is generally conversant with the art this is particularly the case in the charge for alterations and corrections some of which although apparently trivial occupy the compositors much time in making it should also be observed that the publisher in this case becomes responsible for the payments to those persons  it is not necessary that the author should avail himself of this intervention although it is the interest of the publisher that he should; and booksellers usually maintain that the author cannot procure his paper or printing at a cheaper rate if he go at once to the producers this appears from the evidence given before the committee of the house of commons in the copyright acts may  mr o rees bookseller of the house of longman and co paternoster row examined q suppose a gentleman to publish a work on his own account and to incur all the various expenses; could he get the paper at s a ream? a i presume not; i presume a stationer would not sell the paper at the same price to an indifferent gentleman as to the trade q the committee asked you if a private gentleman was to publish a work on his own account if he would not pay more for the paper than persons in the trade; the committee wish to be informed whether a printer does not charge a gentleman a higher rate than to a publisher a i conceive they generally charge a profit on the paper q do not the printers charge a higher price also for printing than they do to the trade? a i always understood that they do  there appears to be little reason for this distinction in charging for printing a larger price to the author than to the publisher provided the former is able to give equal security for the payment with respect to the additional charge on paper if the author employs either publisher or printer to purchase it they ought to receive a moderate remuneration for the risk since they become responsible for the payment; but there is no reason why if the author deals at once with the papermaker he should not purchase on the same terms as the printer; and if he choose by paying ready money not to avail himself of the long credit allowed in those trades he ought to procure his paper considerably cheaper  it is time however that such conventional combinations between different trades should be done away with in a country so eminently depending for its wealth on its manufacturing industry it is of importance that there should exist no abrupt distinction of classes and that the highest of the aristocracy should feel proud of being connected either personally or through their relatives with those pursuits on which their country's greatness depends the wealthier manufacturers and merchants already mix with those classes and the larger and even the middling tradesmen are frequently found associating with the gentry of the land it is good that this ambition should be cultivated not by any rivalry in expense but by a rivalry in knowledge and in liberal feelings; and few things would more contribute to so desirable an effect than the abolition of all such contracted views as those to which we have alluded the advantage to the other classes would be an increased acquaintance with the productive arts of the country an increased attention to the importance of acquiring habits of punctuality and of business and above all a general feeling that it is honourable in any rank of life to increase our own and our country's riches by employing our talents in the production or in the distribution of wealth  another circumstance omitted to be noticed in the first edition relates to what is technically called the overplus which may be now explained when copies of a work are to be printed each sheet of it requires one ream of paper now a ream as used by printers consists of  quires or sheets this excess of sixteen sheets is necessary in order to allow for 'revises'for preparing and adjusting the press for the due performance of its work and to supply the place of any sheets which may be accidentally dirtied or destroyed in the processes of printing or injured by the binder in putting into boards it is found however that three per cent is more than the proportion destroyed and that damage is less frequent in proportion to the skill and care of the workmen from the evidence of several highly respectable booksellers and printers before the committee of the house of commons on the copyright act may it appears that the average number of surplus copies above is between two and three; that on smaller impressions it is less whilst on larger editions it is greater; that in some instances the complete number of is not made up in which case the printer is obliged to pay for completing it; and that in no instance have the whole sixteen extra copies been completed on the volume in the reader's hands the edition of which consisted of the surplus amounted to fiftytwoa circumstance arising from the improvements in printing and the increased care of the pressmen now this overplus ought to be accounted for to the authorand i believe it usually is so by all respectable publishers  in order to prevent the printer from privately taking off a larger number of impressions than he delivers to the author or publisher various expedients have been adopted in some works a particular watermark has been used in paper made purposely for the book thus the words 'mecanique celeste' appear in the watermark of the two first volumes of the great work of laplace in other cases where the work is illustrated by engravings such a fraud would be useless without the concurrence of the copperplate printer in france it is usual to print a notice on the back of the title page that no copies are genuine without the subjoined signature of the author and attached to this notice is the author's name either written or printed by hand from a wooden block but notwithstanding this precaution i have recently purchased a volume printed at paris in which the notice exists but no signature is attached in london there is not much danger of such frauds because the printers are men of capital to whom the profit on such a transaction would be trifling and the risk of the detection of a fact which must of necessity be known to many of their workmen would be so great as to render the attempt at it folly  perhaps the best advice to an author if he publishes on his own account and is a reasonable person possessed of common sense would be to go at once to a respectable printer and make his arrangements with him  if the author do not wish to print his work at his own risk then he should make an agreement with a publisher for an edition of a limited number; but he should by no means sell the copyright if the work contains woodcuts or engravings it would be judicious to make it part of the contract that they shall become the author's property with the view to their use in a subsequent edition of the works if they should be required an agreement is frequently made by which the publisher advances the money and incurs all the risk on condition of his sharing the profits with the author the profits alluded to are for the present work the last item of section or l s  having now explained all the arrangements in printing the present volume let us return to section and examine the distribution of the l paid by the public of this sum l was the cost of the book l was taxes l was the charges of the bookseller in conveying it to the consumer and l remained for authorship the largest portion or l goes into the pockets of the booksellers; and as they do not advance capital and incur very little risk this certainly appears to be an unreasonable allowance the most extravagant part of the charge is the thirtythree per cent which is allowed as profit on retailing the book it is stated however that all retail booksellers allow to their customers a discount of ten per cent upon orders above s and that consequently the nominal profit of fortyfour or thirtythree per cent is very much reduced if this is the case it may fairly be enquired why the price of l for example is printed upon the back of a book when every bookseller is ready to sell it at l s and why those who are unacquainted with that circumstance should be made to pay more than others who are better informed?  several reasons have been alleged as justifying this high rate of profit first it has been alleged that the purchasers of books take long credit this probably is often the case and admitting it no reasonable person can object to a proportionate increase of price but it is no less clear that persons who do pay ready money should not be charged the same price as those who defer their payments to a remote period secondly it has been urged that large profits are necessary to pay for the great expenses of bookselling establishments; that rents are high and taxes heavy; and that it would be impossible for the great booksellers to compete with the smaller ones unless the retail profits were great in reply to this it may be observed that the booksellers are subject to no peculiar pressure which does not attach to all other retail trades it may also be remarked that large establishments always have advantages over smaller ones in the economy arising from the division of labour; and it is scarcely to be presumed that booksellers are the only class who in large concerns neglect to avail themselves of them thirdly it has been pretended that this high rate of profit is necessary to cover the risk of the bookseller's having some copies left on his shelves; but he is not obliged to buy of the publisher a single copy more than he has orders for and if he do purchase more at the subscription price he proves by the very fact that he himself does not estimate that risk at more than from four to eight per cent  it has been truly observed on the other hand that many copies of books are spoiled by persons who enter the shops of booksellers without intending to make any purchase but not to mention that such persons finding on the tables various new publications are frequently induced by that opportunity of inspecting them to become purchasers this damage does not apply to all booksellers nor to all books; of course it is not necessary to keep in the shop books of small probable demand or great price in the present case the retail profit on three copies only namely s d would pay the whole cost of the one copy soiled in the shop; and even that copy might afterwards produce at an auction half or a third of its cost price the argument therefore from disappointments in the sale of books and that arising from heavy stock are totally groundless in the question between publisher and author it shold be remarked also that the publisher is generally a retail as well as a wholesale bookseller; and that besides his profit upon every copy which he sells in his capacity of agent he is allowed to charge the author as if every copy had been subscribed for at s d and of course he receives the same profit as the rest of the wholesale traders for the books retailed in his own shop  in the country there is more reason for a considerable allowance between the retail dealer and the public; because the profit of the country bookseller is diminished by the expense of the carriage of the books from london he must also pay a commission usually five per cent to his london agent on all those books which his correspondent does not himself publish if to this be added a discount of five per cent allowed for ready money to every customer and of ten per cent to book clubs the profit of the bookseller in a small country town is by no means too large some of the writers who have published criticisms on the observations made in the first edition of this work have admitted that the apparent rate of profit to the booksellers is too large but they have on the other hand urged that too favourable a case is taken in supposing the whole copies sold if the reader will turn back to section he will find that the expense of the three first items remains the same whatever be the number of copies sold; and on looking over the remaining items he will perceive that the bookseller who incurs very little risk and no outlay derives exactly the same profit per cent on the copies sold whatever their numbers may be this however is not the case with the unfortunate author on whom nearly the whole of the loss falls undivided the same writers have also maintained that the profit is fixed at the rate mentioned in order to enable the bookseller to sustain losses unavoidably incurred in the purchase and retail of other books this is the weakest of all arguments it would be equally just that a merchant should charge an extravagant commission for an undertaking unaccompanied with any risk in order to repay himself for the losses which his own want of skill might lead to in his other mercantile transactions  that the profit in retailing books is really too large is proved by several circumstances first that the same nominal rate of profit has existed in the bookselling trade for a long series of years notwithstanding the great fluctuations in the rate of profit on capital invested in every other business secondly that until very lately a multitude of booksellers in all parts of london were content with a much smaller profit and were willing to sell for ready money or at short credit to persons of undoubted character at a profit of only ten per cent and in some instances even at a still smaller percentage instead of that of twentyfive per cent on the published prices thirdly that they are unable to maintain this rate of profit except by a combination the object of which is to put down all competition  some time ago a small number of the large london booksellers entered into such a combination one of their objects was to prevent any bookseller from selling books for less than ten per cent under the published prices; and in order to enforce this principle they refuse to sell books except at the publishing price to any bookseller who declines signing an agreement to that effect by degrees many were prevailed upon to join this combination; and the effect of the exclusion it inflicted left the small capitalist no option between signing or having his business destroyed ultimately nearly the whole trade comprising about two thousand four hundred persons have been compelled to sign the agreement as might be naturally expected from a compact so injurious to many of the parties to it disputes have arisen; several booksellers have been placed under the ban of the combination who allege that they have not violated its rules and who accuse the opposite party of using spies etc to entrap them*  the origin of this combination has been explained by mr pickering of chancery lane himself a publisher in a printed statement entitled 'booksellers' monopoly' and the following list of booksellers who form the committee for conducting this combination is copied from that printed at the head of each of the cases published by mr pickering  allen j leadenhall street arch j cornhill baldwin r paternoster row booth j duncan j paternoster row hatchard j piccadilly marshall r stationers' court murray j albemarle street rees o paternoster row richardson j m cornhill rivington j st paul's churchyard wilson e royal exchange  in whatever manner the profits are divided between the publisher and the retail bookseller the fact remains that the reader pays for the volume in his hands s and that the author will receive only s d; out of which latter sum the expense of printing the volume must be paid so that in passing through two hands this book has produced a profit of fortyfour per cent this excessive rate of profit has drawn into the book trade a larger share of capital than was really advantageous; and the competition between the different portions of that capital has naturally led to the system of underselling to which the committee above mentioned are endeavouring to put a stop*  there are two parties who chiefly suffer from this combination the public and authors the first party can seldom be induced to take an active part against any grievance; and in fact little is required from it except a cordial support of the authors in any attempt to destroy a combination so injurious to the interests of both many an industrious bookseller would be glad to sell for s the volume which the reader holds in his hand and for which he has paid s; and in doing so for ready money the tradesman who paid s d for the book would realize without the least risk a profit of eleven per cent on the money he had advanced it is one of the objects of the combination we are discussing to prevent the small capitalist from employing his capital at that rate of profit which he thinks most advantageous to himself; and such a proceeding is decidedly injurious to the public  having derived little pecuniary advantage from my own literary productions; and being aware that from the very nature of their subjects they can scarcely be expected to reimburse the expense of preparing them i may be permitted to offer an opinion upon the subject which i believe to be as little influenced by any expectation of advantage from the future as it is by any disappointment at the past before however we proceed to sketch the plan of a campaign against paternoster row it will be fit to inform the reader of the nature of the enemies' forces and of his means of attack and defence several of the great publishers find it convenient to be the proprietors of reviews magazines journals and even of newspapers the editors are paid in some instances very handsomely for their superintendence; and it is scarcely to be expected that they should always mete out the severest justice on works by the sale of which their employers are enriched the great and popular works of the day are of course reviewed with some care and with deference to public opinion without this the journals would not sell; and it is convenient to be able to quote such articles as instances of impartiality under shelter of this a host of ephemeral productions are written into a transitory popularity; and by the aid of this process the shelves of the booksellers as well as the pockets of the public are disencumbered to such an extent are these means employed that some of the periodical publications of the day ought to be regarded merely as advertising machines that the reader may be in some measure on his guard against such modes of influencing his judgement he should examine whether the work reviewed is published by the bookseller who is the proprietor of the review; a fact which can sometimes be ascertained from the title of the book as given at the head of the article but this is by no means a certain criterion because partnerships in various publications exist between houses in the book trade which are not generally known to the public; so that in fact until reviews are established in which booksellers have no interest they can never be safely trusted  in order to put down the combination of booksellers no plan appears so likely to succeed as a counterassociation of authors if any considerable portion of the literary world were to unite and form such an association; and if its affairs were directed by an active committee much might be accomplished the objects of such an union should be to employ some person well skilled in the printing and in the bookselling trade; and to establish him in some central situation as their agent each member of the association to be at liberty to place any or all of his works in the hands of this agent for sale; to allow any advertisements or list of books published by members of the association to be stitched up at the end of each of his own productions; the expense of preparing them being defrayed by the proprietors of the books advertised the duties of the agent would be to retail to the public for ready money copies of books published by members of the association to sell to the trade at prices agreed upon any copies they may require to cause to be inserted in the journals or at the end of works published by members any advertisements which the committee or authors may direct to prepare a general catalogue of the works of members to be the agent for any member of the association respecting the printing of any work such a union would naturally present other advantages; and as each author would retain the liberty of putting any price he might think fit on his productions the public would have the advantage of reduction in price produced by competition between authors on the same subject as well as of that arising from a cheaper mode of publishing the volumes sold to them  possibly one of the consequences resulting from such an association would be the establishment of a good and an impartial review a work the want of which has been felt for several years the two longestablished and celebrated reviews the unbending champions of the most opposite political opinions are from widely differing causes exhibiting unequivocal signs of decrepitude and decay the quarterly advocate of despotic principles is fast receding from the advancing intelligence of the age; the new strength and new position which that intelligence has acquired demands for its expression new organs equally the representatives of its intellectual power and of its moral energies whilst on the other hand the sceptre of the northern critics has passed from the vigorous grasp of those who established its dominion into feebler hands  it may be stated as a difficulty in realizing this suggestion that those most competent to supply periodical criticism are already engaged but it is to be observed that there are many who now supply literary criticisms to journals the political principles of which they disapprove; and that if once a respectable and wellsupported review* were established capable of competing in payment to its contributors with the wealthiest of its rivals it would very soon be supplied with the best materials the country can produce * it may also be apprehended that such a combination of authors would be favourable to each other there are two temptations to which an editor of a review is commonly exposed the first is a tendency to consult too much in the works he criticizes the interest of the proprietor of his review; the second a similar inclination to consult the interests of his friends the plan which has been proposed removes one of these temptations but it would be very difficult if not impossible to destroy the other notes  the whole of the subsequent details relate to the first edition of this work  these details vary with different books and different publishers; those given in the text are believed to substantially correct and are applicable to works like the present  it is now understood that the use of spies has been given up; and it is also known that the system of underselling is again privately resorted to by many so that the injury arising from this arbitrary system pursued by the great booksellers affects only or most severely those whose adherence to an extorted promise most deserves respect note to the second edition  the monopoly cases nos  and of those published by mr pickering should be consulted upon this point; and as the public will be better able to form a judgement by hearing the other side of the question it is to be hoped the chairman of the committee mr richardson will publish those regulations respecting the trade a copy of which mr pickering states is refused by the committee even to those who sign them  at the moment when this opinion as to the necessity for a new review was passing through the press i was informed that the elements of such an undertaking were already organized  i have been suggested to me that the doctrines maintained in this chapter may subject the present volume to the opposition of that combination which it has opposed i do not entertain that opinion; and for this reason that the booksellers are too shrewd a class to supply such an admirable passport to publicity as their opposition would prove to be if generally suspected but should my readers take a different view of the question they can easily assist in remedying the evil by each mentioning the existence of this little volume to two of his friends i was wrong in this conjecture; all booksellers are not so shrewd as i had imagined for some did refuse to sell this volume; consequently others sold a larger number of copies in the preface to the second edition at the commencement of this volume the reader will find some further observation on the effect of the booksellers' combination  chapter  on the effect of machinery in reducing the demand for labour  one of the objections most frequently urged against machinery is that it has a tendency to supersede much of the hand labour which was previously employed; and in fact unless a machine diminished the labour necessary to make an article it could never come into use but if it have that effect its owner in order to extend the sale of his produce will be obliged to undersell his competitors; this will induce them also to introduce the new machine and the effect of this competition will soon cause the article to fall until the profits on capital under the new system shall be reduced to the same rate as under the old although therefore the use of machinery has at first a tendency to throw labour out of employment yet the increased demand consequent upon the reduced price almost immediately absorbs a considerable portion of that labour and perhaps in some cases the whole of what would otherwise have been displaced that the effect of a new machine is to diminish the labour required for the production of the same quantity of manufactured commodities may be clearly perceived by imagining a society in which occupations are not divided each man himself manufacturing all the articles he consumes supposing each individual to labour during ten hours daily one of which is devoted to making shoes it is evident that if any tool or machine be introduced by the use of which his shoes can be made in half the usual time then each member of the community will enjoy the same comforts as before by only nine and onehalf hours' labour  if therefore we wish to prove that the total quantity of labour is not diminished by the introduction of machines we must have recourse to some other principle of our nature but the same motive which urges a man to activity will become additionally powerful when he finds his comforts procured with diminished labour; and in such circumstances it is probable that many would employ the time thus redeemed in contriving new tools for other branches of their occupations he who has habitually worked ten hours a day will employ the half hour saved by the new machine in gratifying some other want; and as each new machine adds to these gratifications new luxuries will open to his view which continued enjoyment will as surely render necessary to his happiness  in countries where occupations are divided and where the division of labour is practised the ultimate consequence of improvements in machinery is almost invariably to cause a greater demand for labour frequently the new labour requires at its commencement a higher degree of skill than the old; and unfortunately the class of persons driven out of the old employment are not always qualified for the new one; so that a certain interval must elapse before the whole of their labour is wanted this for a time produces considerable suffering amongst the working classes; and it is of great importance for their happiness that they should be aware of these effects and be enabled to foresee them at an early period in order to diminish as much as possible the injury resulting from them  one very important enquiry which this subject presents is the question whether it is more for the interest of the working classes that improved machinery should be so perfect as to defy the competition of hand labour; and that they should thus be at once driven out of the trade by it; or be gradually forced to quit it by the slow and successive advances of the machine? the suffering which arises from a quick transition is undoubtedly more intense; but it is also much less permanent than that which results from the slower process and if the competition is perceived to be perfectly hopeless the workman will at once set himself to learn a new department of his art on the other hand although new machinery causes an increased demand for skill in those who make and repair it and in those who first superintend its use; yet there are other cases in which it enables children and inferior workmen to execute work that previously required greater skill in such circumstances even though the increased demand for the article produced by its diminished price should speedily give occupation to all who were before employed yet the very diminution of the skill required would open a wider field of competition amongst the working classes themselves that machines do not even at their first introduction invariably throw human labour out of employment must be admitted; and it has been maintained by persons very competent to form an opinion on the subject that they never produce that effect the solution of this question depends on facts which unfortunately have not yet been collected and the circumstance of our not possessing the data necessary for the full examination of so important a subject supplies an additional reason for impressing upon the minds of all who are interested in such enquiries the importance of procuring accurate registries at various times of the number of persons employed in particular branches of manufacture of the number of machines used by them and of the wages they receive  in relation to the enquiry just mentioned i shall offer some remarks upon the facts within my knowledge; and only regret that those which i can support by numerical statement are so few when the crushing mill used in cornwall and other mining countries superseded the labour of a great number of young women who worked very hard in breaking ores with flat hammers no distress followed the reason of this appears to have been that the proprietors of the mines having one portion of their capital released by the superior cheapness of the process executed by the mills found it their interest to apply more labour to other operations the women disengaged from mere drudgery were thus profitably employed in dressing the ores a work which required skill and judgement in the selection  the increased production arising from alterations in the machinery or from improved modes of using it appears from the following table a machine called in the cotton manufacture a 'stretcher' worked by one man produced as follows  year; pounds of cotton spun; roving wages per score; rate of earning per week   s d s d  *    the same man working at another stretcher the roving a little finer produced      in this instance production has gradually increased until at the end of twentytwo years three times as much work is done as at the commencement although the manual labour employed remains the same the weekly earnings of the workmen have not fluctuated very much and appear on the whole to have advanced but it would be imprudent to push too far reasonings founded upon a single instance  the produce of spindles of 'mule yarn spinning' at different periods was as follows year; hanks about to the pound; wages per thousand s d ; ;  ; ;  ; ; the subjoined view of the state of weaving by hand and by powerlooms at stockport in the years and is taken from an enumeration of the machines contained in factories and was collected for the purpose of being given in evidence before a committee of the house of commons     in  in  handloom weavers     decrease persons using powerlooms   increase persons to dress the warp    increase total persons employed    increase powerlooms     increase during this period the number of handlooms in employment has diminished to less than onethird whilst that of powerlooms has increased to more than five times its former amount the total number of workmen has increased about onethird; but the amount of manufactured goods supposing each powerloom to do only the work of three handlooms is three and a half times as large as it was before  in considering this increase of employment it must be admitted that the two thousand persons thrown out of work are not exactly of the same class as those called into employment by the powerlooms a handweaver must possess bodily strength which is not essential for a person attending a powerloom; consequently women and young persons of both sexes from fifteen to seventeen years of age find employment in powerloom factories this however would be a very limited view of the employment arising from the introduction of powerlooms the skill called into action in building the new factories in constructing the new machinery in making the steamengines to drive it and in devising improvements in the structure of the looms as well as in regulating the economy of the establishment is of a much higher order than that which it had assisted in superseding; and if we possessed any means of measuring this it would probably be found larger in amount nor in this view of the subject must we omit the fact that although handlooms would have increased in number if those moved by steam had not been invented yet it is the cheapness of the article manufactured by powerlooms which has caused this great extension of their employment and that by diminishing the price of one article of commerce we always call into additional activity the energy of those who produce others it appears that the number of handlooms in use in england and scotland in was about ; nearly the same number existed in the year whereas the number of powerlooms which in was had in been when it is considered that each of these powerlooms did as much work as three worked by hand the increased producing power was equal to that of handlooms during the whole of this period the wages and employment of handloom weavers have been very precarious  increased intelligence amongst the working classes may enable them to foresee some of those improvements which are likely for a time to affect the value of their labour; and the assistance of savings banks and friendly societies the advantages of which can never be too frequently or too strongly pressed upon their attention may be of some avail in remedying the evil but it may be useful also to suggest to them that a diversity of employments amongst the members of one family will tend in some measure to mitigate the privations which arise from fluctuation in the value of labour notes  in the workman's wages were guaranteed not to be less than s  chapter  on the effect of taxes and of legal restrictions upon manufactures  as soon as a tax is put upon any article the ingenuity of those who make and of those who use it is directed to the means of evading as large a part of the tax as they can; and this may often be accomplished in ways which are perfectly fair and legal an excise duty exists at present of d* per pound upon all writing paper the effect of this impost is that much of the paper which is employed is made extremely thin in order that the weight of a given number of sheets may be as small as possible soon after the first imposition of the tax upon windows which depended upon their number and not upon their size newbuilt houses began to have fewer windows and those of larger dimensions than before staircases were lighted by extremely long windows illuminating three or four flights of stairs when the tax was increased and the size of windows charged as single was limited then still greater care was taken to have as few windows as possible and internal lights became frequent these internal lights in their turn became the subject of taxation; but it was easy to evade the discovery of them and in the last act of parliament reducing the assessed taxes they ceased to be chargeable from the changes thus successively introduced in the number the forms and the positions of the windows a tolerable conjecture might in some instances be formed of the age of a house  a tax on windows is exposed to objection on the double ground of its excluding air and light and it is on both accounts injurious to health the importance of light to the enjoyment of health is not perhaps sufficiently appreciated in the cold and more variable climates it is of still greater importance than in warmer countries  the effects of regulations of excise upon our home manufactures are often productive of great inconvenience; and check materially the natural progress of improvement it is frequently necessary for the purposes of revenue to oblige manufacturers to take out a license and to compel them to work according to certain rules and to make certain stated quantities at each operation when these quantities are large as in general they are they deter manufacturers from making experiments and thus impede improvements both in the mode of conducting the processes and in the introduction of new materials difficulties of this nature have occurred in experimenting upon glass for optical purposes; but in this case permission has been obtained by fit persons to make experiments without the interference of the excise it ought however to be remembered that such permission if frequently or indiscriminately granted might be abused the greatest protection against such an abuse will be found in bringing the force of public opinion to bear upon scientific men and thus enabling the proper authorities although themselves but moderately conversant with science to judge of the propriety of the permission from the public character of the applicant  from the evidence given in before the committee of the house of commons on distillation from sugar and molasses it appeared that by a different mode of working from that prescribed by the excise the spirits from a given weight of corn which then produced eighteen gallons might easily have been increased to twenty gallons nothing more is required for this purpose than to make what is called the wash weaker the consequence of which is that fermentation goes on to a greater extent it was stated however that such a deviation would render the collection of the duty liable to great difficulties; and that it would not benefit the distiller much since his price was enhanced to the customer by any increase of expense in the fabrication here then is a case in which a quantity amounting to oneninth of the total produce is actually lost to the country a similar effect arises in the coal trade from the effect of a duty for according to the evidence before the house of commons it appears that a considerable quantity of the very best coal is actually wasted the extent of this waste is very various in different mines; but in some cases it amounts to onethird  the effects of duties upon the import of foreign manufactures are equally curious a singular instance occurred in the united states where bariron was on its introduction liable to a duty of per cent ad valorem whilst hardware was charged at per cent only in consequence of this tax large quantities of malleable iron rails for railroads were imported into america under the denomination of hardware; the difference of per cent in duty more than counter balancing the expense of fashioning the iron into rails prior to its importation  duties drawbacks and bounties when considerable in amount are all liable to objections of a very serious nature from the frauds to which they give rise it has been stated before committees of the house of commons that calicoes made up in the form and with the appearance of linen have frequently been exported for the purpose of obtaining the bounty for calico made up in this way sells only at s d per yard whereas linen of equal fineness is worth from s d to s d per yard it appeared from the evidence that one house in six months sold five hundred such pieces of calico in almost all cases heavy duties or prohibitions are ineffective as well as injurious; for unless the articles excluded are of very large dimensions there constantly arises a price at which they will be clandestinely imported by the smuggler the extent therefore to which smuggling can be carried should always be considered in the imposition of new duties or in the alteration of old ones unfortunately it has been pushed so far and is so systematically conducted between this country and france that the price per cent at which most contraband articles can be procured is perfectly well known from the evidence of mr galloway it appears that from to per cent was the rate of insurance on exporting prohibited machinery from england and that the larger the quantity the less was the percentage demanded from evidence given in the report of the watch and clockmakers' committee in it appears that persons were constantly in the habit of receiving in france watches lace silks and other articles of value easily portable and delivering them in england at ten per cent on their estimated worth in which sum the cost of transport and the risk of smuggling were included  the process employed in manufacturing often depends upon the mode in which a tax is levied on the materials or on the article produced w atch glasses are made in england by workmen who purchase from the glass house globes of five or six inches in diameter out of which by means of a piece of redhot tobacco pipe guided round a pattern watch glass placed on the globe they crack five others these are afterwards ground and smoothed on the edges in the tyrol the rough watch glasses are supplied at once from the glass house; the workman applying a thick ring of cold glass to each globe as soon as it is blown causes a piece of the size of a watch glass to be cracked out the remaining portion of the globe is immediately broken and returns to the melting pot this process could not be adopted in england with the same economy because the whole of the glass taken out of the pot is subject to the excise duty  the objections thus stated as incidental to particular modes of taxation are not raised with a view to the removal of those particular taxes; their fitness or unfitness must be decided by a much wider enquiry into which it is not the object of this volume to enter taxes are essential for the security both of liberty and property and the evils which have been mentioned may be the least amongst those which might have been chosen it is however important that the various effects of every tax should be studied and that those should be adopted which upon the whole are found to give the least check to the productive industry of the country  in enquiring into the effect produced or to be apprehended from any particular mode of taxation it is necessary to examine a little into the interests of the parties who approve of the plan in question as well as of those who object to it instances have occurred where the persons paying a tax into the hands of government have themselves been adverse to any reduction this happened in the case of one class of calicoprinters whose interest really was injured by a removal of the tax on the printing they received from the manufacturers payment for the duty about two months before they were themselves called on to pay it to government; and the consequence was that a considerable capital always remained in their hands the evidence which states this circumstance is well calculated to promote a reasonable circumspection in such enquiries question do you happen to know anything of an opposition from calico printers to the repeal of the tax on printed calicoes? answer i have certainly heard of such an opposition and am not surprised at it there are very few individuals who are in fact interested in the nonrepeal of the tax; there are two classes of calicoprinters; one who print their own cloth send their goods into the market and sell them on their own account; they frequently advance the duty to government and pay it in cash before their goods are sold but generally before the goods are paid for being most commonly sold on a credit of six months they are of course interested on that account as well as on others that have been stated in the repeal of the tax the other class of calicoprinters print the cloth of other people; they print for hire and on redelivery of the cloth when printed they receive the amount of the duty which they are not called upon to pay to government sooner on an average than nine weeks from the stamping of the goods where the business is carried on upon a large scale the arrears of duty due to government often amount to eight or even ten thousand pounds and furnish a capital with which these gentlemen carry on their business; it is not therefore to be wondered at that they should be opposed to the prayer of our petition  the policy of giving bounties upon home productions and of enforcing restrictions against those which can be produced more cheaply in other countries is of a very questionable nature and except for the purpose of introducing a new manufacture in a country where there is not much commercial or manufacturing spirit is scarcely to be defended all incidental modes of taxing one class of the community the consumers to an unknown extent for the sake of supporting another class the manufacturers who would otherwise abandon that mode of employing their capital are highly objectionable one part of the price of any article produced under such circumstances consists of the expenditure together with the ordinary profits of capital the other part of its price may be looked upon as charity given to induce the manufacturer to continue an unprofitable use of his capital in order to give employment to his workmen if the sum of what the consumers are thus forced to pay merely on account of these artificial restrictions where generally known its amount would astonish even those who advocate them; and it would be evident to both parties that the employment of capital in those branches of trade ought to be abandoned  the restriction of articles produced in a manufactory to certain sizes is attended with some good effect in an economical view arising chiefly from the smaller number of different tools required in making them as well as from less frequent change in the adjustment of those tools a similar source of economy is employed in the navy by having ships divided into a certain number of classes each of which comprises vessels of the same dimensions the rigging made for one vessel will fit any other of its class; a circumstance which renders the supply of distant stations more easy  the effects of the removal of a monopoly are often very important and they were perhaps never more remarkable than in the bobbin net trade in the years and these effects were however considerably enhanced by the general rage for speculation which was so prevalent during that singular period one of the patents of mr heathcote for a bobbin net machine had just then expired whilst another for an improvement in a particular part of such machines called a turn again had yet a few years to run many licenses had been granted to use the former patent which were charged at the rate of about five pounds per annum for each quarter of a yard in width so that what is termed a sixquarter frame which makes bobbin net a yard and a half wide paid thirty pounds a year the second patent was ultimately abandoned in august infringements of it having taken place it was not surprising that on the removal of the monopoly arising from this patent a multitude of persons became desirous of embarking in a trade which had hitherto yielded a very large profit the bobbin net machine occupies little space; and is from that circumstance well adapted for a domestic manufacture the machines which already existed were principally in the hands of the manufacturers; but a kind of mania for obtaining them seized on persons of all descriptions who could raise a small capital; and under its influence butchers bakers small farmers publicans gentlemen's servants and in some cases even clergymen became anxious to possess bobbin net machines some few machines were rented; but in most of these cases the workman purchased the machine he employed by instalments of from l to l weekly for a six quarter machine; and many individuals unacquainted with the mode of using the machines so purchased paid others of more experience for instructing them in their use; l or l being sometimes given for this instruction the success of the first speculators induced others to follow the example; and the machinemakers were almost overwhelmed with orders for lace frames such was the desire to procure them that many persons deposited a large part or the whole of the price in the hands of the framemakers in order to insure their having the earliest supply this as might naturally be expected raised the price of wages amongst the workmen employed in machinemaking; and the effect was felt at a considerable distance from nottingham which was the centre of this mania smiths not used to flat filing coming from distant parts earned from s to s per week finishing smiths accustomed to the work gained from l to l per weekthe forging smith if accustomed to his work gained from l to l per week and some few earned l per week in making what are technically called insides those who were best paid were generally clock and watchmakers from all the districts round who received from l to l per week the settersuppersons who put the parts of the machine togethercharged l for their assistance; and a six quarter machine could be put together in a fortnight or three weeks  good workmen being thus induced to desert less profitable branches of their business in order to supply this extraordinary demand the masters in other trades soon found their men leaving them without being aware of the immediate reason some of the more intelligent however ascertained the cause they went from birmingham to nottingham in order to examine into the circumstances which had seduced almost all the journeymen clockmakers from their own workshops; and it was soon apparent that the men who had been working as clockmakers in birmingham at the rate of s a week could earn l by working at lace framemaking in nottingham on examining the nature of this profitable work the master clockmakers perceived that one part of the bobbin net machines that which held the bobbins could easily be made in their own workshops they therefore contracted with the machinemakers who had already more work ordered than they could execute to supply the bobbin carriers at a price which enabled them on their return home to give such increased wages as were sufficient to retain their own workmen as well as yield themselves a good profit thus an additional facility was afforded for the construction of these bobbin net machines and the conclusion was not difficult to be foreseen the immense supply of bobbin net thus poured into the market speedily reduced its price; this reduction in price rendered the machines by which the net was made less valuable; some few of the earliest producers for a short time carried on a profitable trade; but multitudes were disappointed and many ruined the low price at which the fabric sold together with its lightness and beauty combined to extend the sale; and ultimately new improvements in the machines rendered the older ones still less valuable owing to the universal use of watches resulting from their cheapness the possessor of a pocket timepiece soon ceases to take a pride in the delicate mechanism which at first added an inch or two to his stature at night it is wound up mechanically and thrust under the pillow to be safe from imaginary burglars and handy when the morning comes the awakened sleeper feels small gratitude to his faithful little servant which all night long has been beating out the seconds so that its master may know just where he is with regard to the enemy on the morrow at last a hand is slipped under the featherbag and the watch is dragged from its snug hidingplace bother it says the sleepy owner halfpast eight; ought to have been up an hour ago! and out he tumbles dressing concluded the watch passes to its day quarters in a darksome waistcoat pocket to be hauled out many times for its opinion to be taken the real usefulness of a watch is best learnt by being without one for a day or two there are plenty of clocks about but not always in sight; and one gradually experiences a mild irritation at having to step round the corner to find out what the hands are doing a truly wonderful piece of machinery is a watcheven a cheap one an expensive highclass article is worthy of our admiration and respect here is one that has been in constant use for fifty years twice a second its little balancewheel revolves on its jewelled bearings allowing a few days for repairs we find by calculation that the watch has made no less than three thousand million movements in the halfcentury! and still it goes ticking on ready to do another fifty years' work how beautifully tempered must be the springs and the steel faces which are constantly rubbing against jewel or metal! how perfectly cut the teeth which have engaged one another times innumerable without showing appreciable wear! the chief value of a good watch lies in its accuracy as a timekeeper it is of course easy to correct it by standard clocks in the railway stations or public buildings; but one may forget to do this and in a week or two a loss of a few minutes may lead to one missing a train or being late for an important engagement happy therefore is the man who having set his watch to london time can rely on its not varying from accuracy a minute in a weeka feat achieved by many watches the oldfashioned watch was a bulky affair protected by an outer case of ample proportions from year to year the size has gradually diminished until we can now purchase a reliable article no thicker than a fiveshilling piece which will not offend the most fastidious dandy by disarranging the fit of his clothes into the space of a small fraction of an inch is crowded all the usual mechanism reduced to the utmost fineness watches have even been constructed small enough to form part of a ring or earring without losing their timekeeping properties for practical purposes however it is advantageous to have a timepiece of as large a size as may be convenient since the difficulties of adjustment and repair increase with decreasing proportions the ship's chronometer therefore though of watch construction is a big affair as compared with the pocket timepiece; for above all things it must be accurate the need for this arises from the fact that nautical reckonings made by the observation of the heavenly bodies include an element of time we will suppose a vessel to be at sea out of sight of land the captain by referring to the dial of the mechanical log towed astern can reckon pretty accurately how far the vessel has travelled since it left port; but owing to winds and currents he is not certain of the position on the globe's surface at which his ship has arrived to locate this exactly he must learn a his longitude ie distance e or w of greenwich b his latitude ie distance n or s of the equator therefore when noon approaches his chronometers and sextant are got out and at the moment when the sun crosses the meridian the time is taken if this moment happens to coincide with four o'clock on the chronometers he is as far west of greenwich as is represented by four twentyfourths of the ° into which the earth's circumference is divided; that is he is in longitude ° w the sextant gives him the angle made by a line drawn to the sun with another drawn to the horizon and from that he calculates his latitude then he adjourns to the chartroom where by finding the point at which the lines of longitude and latitude intersect he establishes his exact position also when the ship leaves england the chronometer is set by greenwich time and is never touched afterwards except to be wound once a day in order that any error may be reduced to a minimum a merchant ship carries at least two chronometers a manofwar at least three and a surveying vessel as many as a dozen the average reading of the chronometers is taken to work by taking the case of a single chronometer it has often to be relied on for months at a time and during that period has probably to encounter many changes of temperature if it gains or loses from day to day and that consistently it may still be accounted reliable as the amount of error will be allowed for in all calculations but should it gain one day and lose another the accumulated errors would on a voyage of several months become so considerable as to imperil seriously the safety of the vessel if navigating dangerous waters as long ago as the english government recognised the importance of a really reliable chronometer and in that year passed an act offering rewards of £ £ and £ to anybody who should produce a chronometer that would fix longitude within sixty forty and thirty miles respectively of accuracy john harrison the son of a yorkshire carpenter who had already invented the ingenious gridiron pendulum for compensating clocks took up the challenge by he had made a chronometer of so perfect a nature that during a voyage to jamaica that year and back the next it lost only min sec as this would enable a captain to find his longitude within eighteen miles in the latitude of greenwich harrison claimed and ultimately received the maximum reward it was not till nearly a century later that thomas earnshaw produced the compensation balance now generally used on chronometers and highclass watches in cheap watches the balance is usually a little threespoked wheel which at every tick revolves part of a turn and then flies back again this will not suffice for very accurate work because the moment of inertia varies at different temperatures to explain this term let us suppose that a man has a pound of metal to make into a wheel if the wheel be of small diameter you will be able to turn it first one way and then the other on its axle quite easily but should it be melted down and remade into a wheel of four times the diameter with the same amount of metal as before in the rim the difficulty of suddenly reversing its motion will be much increased the weight is the same but the speed of the rim and consequently its momentum is greater it is evident from this that if a wheel of certain size be driven by a spring of constant strength its oscillations will be equal in time; but if a rise of temperature should lengthen the spokes the speed would fall because the spring would have more work to do; and conversely with a fall of temperature the speed would rise earnshaw's problem was to construct a balance wheel that should be able to keep its moment of inertia constant under all circumstances he therefore used only two spokes to his wheel and to the outer extremity of each attached an almost complete semicircle of rim one end being attached to the spoke the other all but meeting the other spoke the rimpieces were built up of an outer strip of brass and an inner strip of steel welded together brass expands more rapidly than steel with the result that a bar compounded of these two metals would when heated bend towards the hollow side to the rimpieces were attached sliding weights adjustable to the position found by experiment to give the best results we can now follow the action of the balance wheel it runs perfectly correctly at say a temperature of ° hold it over a candle the spokes lengthen and carry the rimpieces outwards at their fixed ends; but as the pieces themselves bend inwards at their free ends the balance is restored if the balance were placed in a refrigerating machine the spokes would shorten but the rimpieces would bend outwards as a matter of fact the moment of inertia cannot be kept quite constant by this method because the variation of expansion is more rapid in cold than in heat; so that though a balance might be quite reliable between ° and ° it would fail between ° and ° so the makers fit their balances with what is called a secondary compensation the effect of which is to act more quickly in high than in low temperatures this could not well be explained without diagrams so a mere mention must suffice another detail of chronometer making which requires very careful treatment is the method of transmitting power from the main spring to the works as the spring uncoils its power must decrease and this loss must be counterbalanced somehow this is managed by using the drum and fusee action which may be seen in some clocks and in many old watches the drum is cylindrical and contains the spring the fusee is a tapering shaft in which a spiral groove has been cut from end to end a very fine chain connects the two parts the key is applied to the fusee and the chain is wound off the drum on to the larger end of the fusee first by the time that the spring has been fully wound the chain has reached the fusee's smaller extremity if the fusee has been turned to the correct taper the driving power of the spring will remain constant as it unwinds for it gets least leverage over the fusee when it is strongest and most when it is weakest the intermediate stages being properly proportioned to test this a weighted lever is attached to the key spindle with the weight so adjusted that the fully wound spring has just sufficient power to lift it over the topmost point of a revolution it is then allowed a second turn but if the weight now proves excessive something must be wrong and the fusee needs its diameter reducing at that point so the test goes on from turn to turn and alterations are made until every revolution is managed with exactly the same ease the complete chronometer is sent to greenwich observatory to be tested against the standard clock which at am flashes the hour to other clocks all over great britain in a special room set apart for the purpose are hundreds of instruments some hanging up others lying flat assistants make their rounds noting the errors on each the temperature test is then applied in special ovens and finally the article goes back to the maker with a certificate setting forth its performances under different conditions if the error has been consistent the instrument is sold the buyer being informed exactly what to allow for each day's error at the end of the voyage he brings his chronometer to be tested again and if necessary put right here are the actual variations of a chronometer during a nineteenday test before being used   gain in tenths  day  of seconds  st  nd  rd  th  th  th  th  th  th  th  th  th  th  th  th  th  th  th  th   an average gain of just over one quarter of a second per diem! quite extraordinary feats of timekeeping have been recorded of chronometers on long voyages thus a chronometer which had been to australia viâ the cape and back viâ the red sea was only fifteen seconds out; and the encyclopædia britannica quotes the performance of the three instruments of ss orellana which between them accumulated an error of but · seconds during a sixtythreeday trip an instrument which will cut a blood corpuscle into several partsthat's the microtome the smallcutter as the name implies for the examination of animal tissues it is necessary that they should be sliced very fine before they are subjected to the microscope perhaps a tiny muscle is being investigated and cross sections of it are needed well one cannot pick up the muscle and cut slices off it as you would off a german sausage to begin with it is difficult even to pick the object up; and even if pieces onehundredth of an inch long were detached they would still be far too large for examination so as is usually the case when our unaided powers prove unequal to a task we have recourse to a machine there are several types of microtomes each preferable for certain purposes but as in ordinary laboratory work the cambridge rocking microtome is used let us give our special attention to this particular instrument it is mounted on a strong castiron bed a foot or so in length and four to five inches wide towards one end rise a couple of supports terminating in knifeedges which carry a crossbar itself provided with knifeedges top and bottom those on the top supporting a second transverse bar both bars have a long leg at right angles giving them the appearance of two large t's superimposed one on the other; but the top t is converted into a cross by a fourth membera sliding tube which projects forward towards a frame in which is clamped a razor edge upwards the tail of the lower t terminates in a circular disc pierced with a hole to accommodate the end of a vertical screw which has a large circular head with milled edges the upper t is rocked up and down by a cord and spring the handle actuating the cord also shifting on the milled screwhead a very small distance every time it is rocked backwards and forwards as the screw turns it gradually raises the tail of the lower member and by giving its crossbar a tilt brings the tube of the upper member appreciably nearer the razor the amount of twist given to the screw at each stroke can be easily regulated by a small catch when the microscopist wishes to cut sections he first mounts his object in a lump of hard paraffin wax coated with softer wax the whole is stuck on to the face of the tube so as to be just clear of the razor the operator then seizes the handle and works it rapidly until the first slice is detached by the razor successive slices are stuck together by their soft edges so as to form a continuous ribbon of wax which can be picked up easily and laid on a glass slide the slide is then warmed to melt the paraffin which is dissolved away by alcohol leaving the atoms of tissue untouched these after being stained with some suitable medium are ready for the microscope a skilful user can under favourable conditions cut slices one twentyfive thousandth of an inch thick to gather some idea of what this means we will imagine that a cucumber one foot long and one and ahalf inches in diameter is passed through this wonderful guillotine it would require no less than dinnerplates nine inches across to spread the pieces on! if the slices were oneeighth of an inch thick the cucumber to keep a proportionate total size would be feet long after considering these figures we shall lose some of the respect we hitherto felt for the men who cut the ham to put inside luncheonbar sandwiches in the preceding pages frequent reference has been made to index screws exactly graduated to a convenient number of divisions when such screws have to be manufactured in quantities it would be far too expensive a matter to measure each one separately therefore machinery itself very carefully graduated is used to enable a workman to transfer measurements to a disc of metal if the indexcircle of an astronomical telescopeto take an instancehas to be divided it is centred on a large horizontal disc the circumference of which has been indented with a large number of teeth a wormscrew engages these teeth tangentially ie at right angles to a line drawn from the centre of the plate to the point of engagement on the shaft of the screw is a ratchet pinion in principle the same as the bicycle freewheel which when turned one way also twists the screw but has no effect on it when turned the other way stops are put on the screw so that it shall rotate the large disc only the distance required between any two graduations the divisions are scribed on the indexcircle by a knife attached to a carriage over and parallel to the disc the dividing engine used for the graduation of certain astronomical instruments probably constitutes the most perfect machine ever made in an address to the institution of mechanical engineers the president mr william henry maw used the following words the most recently constructed machine of the kind of which i am awarenamely one made by messrs warner and swasey of cleveland usais capable of automatically cutting the graduations of a circle with an error in position not exceeding one second of arc a second of an arc is approximately the angle subtended by a halfpenny at a distance of three miles this means that on a inch circle the error in position of any one graduation shall not exceed inch now the finest line which would be of any service for reading purposes on such a circle would probably have a width equal to quite ten seconds of arc; and it follows that the minute vshaped cut forming this line must be so absolutely symmetrical with its centre line throughout its length that the position of this centre may be determined within the limit of error just stated by observations of its edges made by aid of the reading micrometer and microscope i may say that after the machine just mentioned had been made it took over a year's hard work to reduce the maximum error in its graduations from one and ahalf to one second of arc the same address contains a reference to the great yerkes telescope which though irrelevant to our present chapter affords so interesting an example of modern mechanical perfection that it deserves parenthetic mention the diameter of a star of the seventh magnitude as it appears in the focus of this huge telescope is inch the spiders' webs stretched across the object glass are about inch in diameter the problem thus is says mr maw to move this twentytwo ton mass the telescope with such steadiness in opposition to the motion of the earth that a star disc inch in diameter can be kept threaded as it were upon a spider's web inch in diameter carried at a radius of thirtytwo feet from the centre of motion i think that you will agree that this is a problem in mechanical engineering demanding no slight skill to solve; but it has been solved and with the most satisfactory results the motions are controlled electrically; and respecting them professor barnard one of the chief observers with this telescope some time ago wrote as follows it is astonishing to see with what perfect instantaneousness the clock takes up the tube the electric slow motions are controlled from the eye end so exact are they that a star can be brought from the edge of the field and stopped instantaneously behind the micrometer wire dividing engines are used for ruling parallel lines on glass and metal to aid in the measurements of microscopical objects or the wavelengths of light a diffraction grating used for measuring the latter has the lines so close together that they would be visible only under a powerful microscope glass being too brittle a special alloy of socalled speculum metal is fashioned into a highly polished plate and this is placed in the machine a delicate screw arrangement gradually feeds the plate forwards under the diamond point which is automatically drawn across the plate between every two movements professor h a rowlands has constructed a parallel dividing engine which has ruled as many as lines to the inch to get a conception of these figures we must once again resort to comparison let us therefore take a furrow as a line and imagine a ploughman going up and down a field times if each furrow be eight inches wide the field would require a breadth of nearly fourteen miles to accommodate all the furrows! again supposing that a plate six inches square were being ruled the lines placed end to end would extend for seventy miles! professor rowlands' machine does the finest work of this kind another very perfect instrument has been built by lord blythswood and as some particulars of it have been kindly supplied they may fitly be appended if a firstclass draughtsman were asked how many parallel straight lines he would rule within the space of one inch it is doubtful whether he would undertake more than to lines lord blythswood's machine can rule fourteen parallel lines on a space equivalent to the edge of the finest tissue paper so delicate are the movements of the machine that it must be protected from variations of temperature which would contract or expand its parts; so the room in which it stands is kept at an even heat by automatic apparatus and to make things doubly sure the engine is further sheltered in a large case having double walls interpacked with cotton wool in constructing the machine it was found impossible with the most scientific tools to cut a toothed wheel sufficiently accurate to drive the mechanism but the errors discovered by microscopes were made good by the invention of a small electroplating brush which added the thinnest imaginable layer of metal to any tooth found deficient during the process of ruling a grating of only a few square inches area the machine must be left severely alone in its closed case the slightest jar would cause unparallelism of a few lines and the ruin of the whole grating so for several days the diamond point has its own way moving backwards and forwards unceasingly over the hard metal in which it chases tiny grooves at the end the plate has the appearance of motherofpearl which is in fact one of nature's diffraction gratings breaking up white light into the colours of the spectrum you will be able to understand that these mechanical gratings are expensive articles sometimes the diamond point breaks halfway through the ruling and a week's work is spoilt also the creation of a reliable machine is a very tedious business ten pounds per square inch of grating is a low price to pay the greatest difficulty met with in the manufacture of the dividing engine is that of obtaining a mathematically correct screw turning on a lathe produces a very rough spiral judged scientifically some threads will be deeper than others and differently spaced the screw must therefore be ground with emery and oil introduced between it and a long nut which is made in four segments and provided with collars for tightening it up against the screw perhaps a fortnight may be expended over the grinding then the screw must undergo rigid tests a nut must be made for it and it has to be mounted in proper bearings the explanation of the method of eliminating errors being very technical it is omitted; but an idea of the care required may be gleaned from professor rowlands' statement that an uncorrected error of of an inch is quite sufficient to ruin a grating! in the houses of parliament there is kept at an even temperature a bronze rod thirtyeight inches long and an inch square in section near the ends are two wells rather more than half an inch deep and at the bottom of the wells are gold studs each engraved with a delicate cross line on their polished surfaces the distance between the lines is the imperial yard of thirtysix inches the bar was made in to replace the standard destroyed in when both houses of parliament were burned the original standard was the work of bird who produced it in in june an act had been passed legalising this standard it says the same straight line or distance between the centers of the said two points in the said gold studs in the said brass rod the brass being at the temperature of sixtytwo degrees by fahrenheit's thermometer shall be and is hereby denominated the 'imperial standard yard' to provide for accidents to the bar the act continues and whereas it is expedient that the said standard yard if lost destroyed defaced or otherwise injured should be restored to the same length by reference to some invariable natural standard and whereas it has been ascertained by the commissioners appointed by his majesty to inquire into the subject of weights and measures that the yard hereby declared to be the imperial standard yard when compared with a pendulum vibrating seconds of mean time in the latitude of london in a vacuum at the level of the sea is in the proportion of thirtysix inches to thirtynine inches and one thousand three hundred and ninetythree tenthousandth parts of an inch the new bar was made however not by this method but by comparing several copies of the original and striking their average length four accurate duplicates of the new standard were secured one of which is kept in the mint one in the charge of the royal society one at westminster palace and the fourth at the royal observatory greenwich in addition forty copies were distributed among the various foreign governments all of the same metal as the original the french metre has also been standardised being equal to one tenmillionth part of a quadrant of the earth's meridian ie of the distance from the equator to either of the poles that is to · inches professor a a michelson has shown that any standard of length may be restored by reference to the measurement of wave lengths of light with an error not exceeding one tenmillionth part of the whole it might be asked why should standards of such great accuracy be required? in rough work such as carpentry it does not indeed matter if measurements are the hundredth of an inch or so out but when we have to deal with scientific instruments telescopes measuring machines engines for dividing distances on a scale or even with metal turning the utmost accuracy becomes needful; and a number of instruments will be much more alike in all dimensions if compared individually with a common standard than if they were only compared with one another supposing for instance a bar of exact diameter is copied; the copy itself copied; and so on a dozen times; the last will probably vary considerably from the correct measurements hence it became necessary to standardise the foot and the inch by accurate subdivisions of the yard this was accomplished by sir joseph whitworth who in obtained two standard yards in the form of measure bars and by the aid of microscopes transferred the distance between the engraved lines to a rectangular endmeasure bar ie one of which the end faces are exactly a yard apart he next constructed his famous machine which is capable of detecting length differences of one millionth of an inch two bars are advanced towards each other by screw gearing one by a screw having twenty threads to the inch and carrying a graduated handwheel with divisions on its rim; the other by a similar screw itself driven by a wormscrew working on the rim which carries teeth the wormscrew has a handwheel with a micrometer graduation into divisions of its circumference so that if this be turned one division the second screw is turned only × of a division and the bar it drives advances only × × = of an inch the screw at the other end of the machine which in appearance somewhat resembles a metal lathe is used for rapid adjustment only illustration delicate measuring machines the upper illustration shows a prattwhitney measuring machine in operation to decide the thickness of a cigarette paper which is onethousandth of an inch thick this machine will measure variations of length or thickness as minute as one hundredththousandth of an inch the lower illustration shows a whitworth measuring machine which is sensitive to variations of onemillionth of an inch he sir j whitworth obtained the subdivision of the yard by making three foot pieces as nearly alike as was possible and working these foot pieces down until each was equal to the others and placing them end to end in his millionth measuring machine; the total length of the three foot pieces was then compared with a standard endmeasure yard these three foot pieces were ground until they were exactly equal to each other and the three added together are equal to the standard yard the subdivision of the foot into inch pieces was made in the same way a doubt may have arisen in the reader's mind as to the possibility of determining whether the measuring machine is screwed up to the exact tightness would the measuring bars not compress a body a little before it appeared tight? workmen when measuring a bar with callipers often judge by the sense of touch whether the jaws of the callipers pass the bar with the proper amount of resistance; but when one has to deal with millionths of an inch such a method would not suffice so sir joseph whitworth introduced a feelingpiece or gravitypiece mr t m goodeve thus describes it in the elements of mechanism the gravitypiece consists of a small plate of steel with parallel plane sides and having slender arms one for its partial support and the other for resting on the finger of the observer one arm of the piece rests on a part of the bed of the machine and the other arm is tilted up by the forefinger of the operator the plane surfaces are then brought together one on each side of the feelingpiece until the pressure of contact is sufficient to hold it supported just as it remained when one end rested on the finger this degree of tightness is perfectly definite and depends on the weight of the gravitypiece but not on the estimation of the observer in this way the expansion due to heat when a inch bar has been touched for an instant with the fingernail may be detected one of the most beautiful measuring machines commercially used comes from the factories of the prattwhitney co hartford connecticut the wellknown makers of machine tools and gauges of all kinds it is made in different sizes the largest admitting an inch bar variations of of an inch are readily determined by the use of this machine it therefore serves for originating gauge sizes or for duplicating existing standards the adjusting screw has fifty threads to the inch and its indexwheel is graduated to divisions giving an advance of inch for each division while by estimation this may be further subdivided to indicate onehalf or even onequarter of this small amount delicacy of contact between the measuring faces is obtained by the use of auxiliary jaws holding a small cylindrical gauge by the pressure of a light helical spring which operates the sliding spindle to which one of these auxiliary jaws is attached on one side of the head of the machine is a vertical microscope directed downwards on to a bar on the bedplate in which are a number of polished steel plugs graved with very fine central cross lines each exactly an inch distant from either of its neighbours a cross wire in the microscope tells when it is accurately abreast of the line below it supposing then that a standard bar three inches in diameter has to be tested the head is slid along until the microscope is exactly over the zero plug line and the divided indexwheel is turned until the two jaws press each other with the minimum force that will hold up the feelingpiece then the head is moved back and centred on the inch line and the bar to be tested is passed between the jaws if the feelingpiece drops out it is too large and the wheel is turned back until the jaws have been opened enough to let the bar through without making the feelingpiece fall an examination of the indexwheel shows in hundredthousandths of an inch what the excess diameter is on the other hand if the bar were too small the jaws would need to be closed a trifle this amount being similarly reckoned we have now got into a region of very practical politics namely the subject of gauges all large engineering works which turn out machinery with interchangeable parts eg screws and nuts must keep their dimensions very constant if purchasers are not to be disgusted and disappointed the small motor machinery so much in evidence today demands that errors should be kept within the tenthousandth of an inch an engineer therefore possesses a set of standard gauges to test the diameter and pitch of his screw threads and nuts; the size of tubes wires; the circumference of wheels etc great inconvenience having been experienced by american railroadcar builders on account of the varying sizes of the screws and bolts which were used on the different tracksthough all were supposed to be of standard dimensionsthe masters determined to put things right; and accordingly professors roger and bond and the prattwhitney co were engaged to work in collaboration in connection with the manufacture of tools for minute measurements viz to inch to give an idea of what is implied by this let it be supposed that a person should take a pair of dividing compasses and lay off prickmarks inch apart in a straight line to do this the line would require to be over feet or nearly a tenth of a mile long imagine that many prickmarks compressed into the space of an inch and you have an imperfect idea of the minuteness of the measurements which can now be made by the pratt and whitney co the standard taps and dies were supplied to toolmakers and engineers who could thus determine whether articles supplied to them were of the proper dimensions nothing more was then heard of nuts being a trifle small or bolts a leetle large and so beautifully tempered were the dies made from the standards that one manufacturer claimed to have cut coldpressed nuts without any difference being perceptible in their sizes to appreciate what the difference of a thousandth of an inch makes in a true fit you should handle a set of plug and ring gauges; the ring a true halfinch internally the plugs halfinch half an inch less one tenthousandth of an inch and half an inch less onethousandth in diameter the true halfinch plug needs to be forcibly driven into the ring on account of the friction between the surfaces the next if oiled will slide in quite easily but if left stationary a moment will seize and have to be driven out the third will wobble very perceptibly and would be at once discarded by a good workman as a bad fit for extremely accurate measurements of rods calliper gauges shaped somewhat like the letter y are used the horns terminating in polished parallel jaws such a gauge will detect a difference of inch quite easily so accurately can plug gauges be made by reference to a measuring machine that a gold leaf inch thick would be three times too thick to insert between the gauge and the jaws of the machine! you must remember that in highclass workmanship these gauges are constantly being used as time goes on the limit of error allowed in many classes of machine parts is gradually lessened which shows the simultaneous improvement of all machinery used in the handling of metal james watt was terribly hampered when developing his steamengine by the difficulty of procuring a true cylinder for his pistons to work in with any approach to steamtightness his first cylinder was made by a smith of hammered iron soldered together the next was cast and bored but stuffing it with paper cork putty pasteboard and old hat proved useless to stem the leakage of steam no wonder considering that the finished cylinder was oneeighth of an inch larger in diameter at one end than at the other watt was in advance of his time neither machinery nor workmanship had progressed sufficiently to meet the requirements of the steamengine today an engineer would confidently undertake to bore a cylinder five feet in diameter with a variation from truth of not more than one fivehundredth of an inch before passing from the subject of measuring machines which play so important a part in modern mechanism we may just glance at the electrical method of dr p e shaw he discovered recently that two clean metal surfaces can by means of an electric current feel one another on touching with a delicacy that far transcends that of the purely mechanical machine the mechanism he employs is thus devised a finely cut vertical screw having fifty threads to the inch has a disc graduated into parts the screw can be turned by means of a pulley string from a distance and it is thus possible to give the top end of the screw a movement of inch when a movement corresponding to one graduation is made this small movement is reduced by a train of six levers the long arm of each bearing on the short arm of the one before it the movement of the last lever of the train is thus reduced to of that of the screw point so a movement of × inch = inch is obtained! how can such a movement be judged? a telephone and voltaic cell are joined to the last lever of the train and to the object whose movement is under examination if they touch the telephone sounds an observer listens in the telephone and if the object moves for any reason he can find out how much it moves by turning the screw until contact is made again out of the many applications of this apparatus three may be given  a short bar of iron when magnetised elongates about of its length if further magnetised it contracts these changes can readily be measured with the instrument  the smallest sound audible in the telephone is due to a movement of the diaphragm of the telephone by about of an inch this has been actually measured by dr shaw and is by far the smallest distance ever directly recorded it is about twice the diameter of the molecules of matter  dispensing with levers the screw alone is used for rougher work dr shaw has shown that one hundredthousandth of an inch is the smallest dimension visible under a microscope by fitting an electric measuring apparatus to the microscope carriage it becomes quite easy to measure minute distances the microscope contains a cross wire which when the object has been laid on the microscope stage is centred on one side of the object the electric contact screw is then advanced till it makes contact with the stage and a sound arises in the telephone a reading of the screw disc having been taken the screw is drawn in and the microscope stage is traversed sufficiently to bring the wire in line with the other side of the object once more the operator makes electrical contact and gets a second reading the difference between the two being the diameter of the object in this manner the bacillus of tuberculosis has been proved to have an average diameter of of an inch the same method is employed to gauge the distance between the lines on a diffraction grating footnotes  april th  g m bond in a lecture delivered before the franklin institute february th  report on standard screw threads philadelphia chapter ii calculating machines  the simplest form of calculating machine was the abacus on which the schoolboys of ancient greece did their sums it consisted of a smooth board with a narrow rim on which were arranged rows of pebbles bits of bone or ivory or silver coins by replacing these little counters by sand strewn evenly all over its surface the abacus was transformed into a slate for writing or geometrical lessons the romans took the abacus along with many other spoils of conquest from the greeks and improved it dividing it by means of crosslines and assigning a multiple value to each line with regard to its neighbours from their method of using the calculi or pebbles we derive our english verb to calculate during the middle ages the abacus still flourished and it has left a further mark on our language by giving its name to the court of exchequer in which was a table divided into chequered squares like this simple school appliance step by step further improvements were made most important among them being those of napier of merchiston whose logarithms vex the heads of our youth and save many an hour's calculation to people who understand how to handle them sir samuel morland gunter and lamb invented other contrivances suitable for trigonometrical problems gersten and pascal harnessed trains of wheels to their readyreckoners somewhat similar to the wellknown cyclometer all these devices faded into insignificance when mr charles babbage came on the scene with his famous calculator which is probably the most ingenious piece of mechanism ever devised by the human brain to describe the difference engine as it is called would be impossible so complicated is its character dr lardner who had a wonderful command of language and could explain details in a manner so lucid that his words could almost always be understood in the absence of diagrams occupied twentyfive pages of the edinburgh review in the endeavour to describe its working but gave several features up as a bad job another clever writer dr samuel smiles frankly shuns the task and satisfies himself with the following brief description some parts of the apparatus and modes of action are indeed extraordinaryand perhaps none more so than that for ensuring accuracy in the calculated resultsthe machine actually correcting itself and rubbing itself back into accuracy by the friction of the adjacent machinery! when an error is made the wheels become locked and refuse to proceed; thus the machine must go rightly or not at allan arrangement as nearly resembling volition as anything that brass and steel are likely to accomplish mr babbage in entered upon the task of superintending the construction of a machine for calculating and printing mathematical and astronomical tables he began by building a model which produced fortyfour figures per minute the next year the royal society reported upon the invention which appeared so promising that the lords of the treasury voted mr babbage £ to help him perfect his apparatus he looked about for a firstrate mechanician of high intelligence as well as of extreme manual skill the man he wanted appeared in mr joseph clement who had already made his name as the inventor of a drawing instrument a selfacting lathe a selfcentring chuck and fluted taps and dies mr clement soon produced special tools for shaping the various parts of the machine so elaborate was the latter that according to dr smiles the drawings for the calculating machinery alonenot to mention the printing machinery which was almost equally elaboratecovered not less than four hundred square feet of surface! you will easily imagine especially if you have ever had a special piece of apparatus made for you by a mechanic that the bills mounted up at an alarming rate; so fast indeed that the government began to ask why this great expense and so little visible result? after seven years' work the engineers' account had reached £ and mr babbage had disbursed an additional £ out of his own pocket mr clement quarrelled with his employerpossibly because he harboured suspicions that they were both off on a wildgoose chaseand withdrew taking all his valuable tools with him the government soon followed his example and poor babbage was left with his halffinished invention a beautiful fragment of a great work it had been designed to calculate as far as twenty figures but was completed only sufficiently to go to five figures in it occupied a prominent place among the mechanical exhibits at the great exhibition illustration a mechanical cashier the printing apparatus of a national cash register it impresses on a paper strip the amount and nature of every money transaction; and also prints a date number advertisement money value and nature of business done on a ticket for the customer we learn with some satisfaction that all this effort was not fated to be fruitless two scientists of stockholmscheutz by namewere so impressed by dr lardner's account of this calculating machine that they carried babbage's scheme through and after twenty years of hard work completed a machine which seemed to be almost capable of thinking the english government spent £ on a copy which at somerset house entered upon the routine duty of working out annuity and other tables for the registrargeneral from babbage's wonderfully and fearfully made machine we pass to a calculator which today may be seen at work in hundreds of thousands of shops and offices it is the most modern substitute for the open till; and by the aid of marvellous interior works acts as accountkeeper and general detective to the money transactions of the establishment in which it is employed there are very many types of cash register and as it would be impossible to enumerate them all we will pass at once to the most perfect type of all known to the makers and vendors as number  this register has at the top an oblong window dotted about the surface confronting the operator are in the particular machine under notice fiftyseven keys; six bearing the letters a b d e h k; three the words paid out charge received on account; and the others money values ranging from £ to d these are arranged in vertical rows at the left end of the instrument is a printing apparatus kept locked by the proprietor; at the right end a handle and a small lever below the register are six drawers each labelled with an initial a customer enters the shop and buys goods to the value of s d an assistant to whom belongs the letter h receives a sovereign in payment he goes to the register and after making sure that his drawer is pushed in till it is locked first presses down the key h and then the keys labelled s and d suddenly like two jacksinthebox up fly into the window two tablets with s d on both their faces so that customer and assistant can see the figures simultaneously a bell of a certain tone rings drawer h flies open so that he may place the money in it and give change if necessary and a rotating arm in the window shows the word cash the assistant now revolves the handle and presses the little lever from a slot on the left side out flies a ticket on the front of which is printed the date a consecutive number the assistant's letter and the amount of the sale the back has also been covered with an advertisement of some kind the ticket and change are handed over to the customer the drawer is shut and the transaction is at an end except for an entry in the shop's books of the article sold a carrier next comes in with a parcel on which fivepence must be paid for transport mr a receives the goods goes to the register presses his letter the key with the words paid out on it and the key carrying d takes out the amount wanted and gives it to the carrier again a gentleman enters and asks for change for half a sovereign mr b obliges him pressing down his letter but no figures fourthly a debtor to the shop pays five shillings to meet an account that has been against him for some time mr k receives the money and plays with the keys k received on account and s giving a ticket receipt lastly a customer buys a pair of boots on credit mr d attends to him and though no cash is handled uses the register pressing the letter charge and say s d now what has been going on inside the machine all this time? let us lift up the cover take off the case of the printing apparatus and see a strip of paper fed through the printing mechanism has on it five rows of figures letters etc thus   s  d  h   pd a    b  rc k  ch d   the proprietor is therefore enabled to see at a glance who served or attended to a customer what kind of business he did with him the monetary value of the transaction at the end of the day each assistant sends in his separate account which should tally exactly with the record of the machine simultaneously with the strip printing special counting apparatus has been a adding up the total of all money taken for goods b recording the number of times the drawer has been opened for each purpose here again is a check upon the records this ingenious machine not only protects the proprietor against carelessness or dishonesty on the part of his employés but also protects the latter against one another if only one drawer and letter were used in common it would be impossible to trace an error to the guilty party the lettering system also serves to show which assistant does the most business where a cash register of this type is employed every transaction must pass through its handsor rather mechanism it would be risky for an assistant not to use the machine as eyes may be watching him he cannot open his drawers without making a record; nor can he make a record without first closing the drawers; so that he must give a reason for each use of the register if he used somebody else's letter the ear of the rightful owner would at once be attracted by the note of his particular gong when going away for lunch or on business a letter can be locked by means of a special key which fits none of the other five locks the printing mechanism is particularly ingenious every morning the date is set by means of indexscrews and a consecutive numbering train is put back to zero

a knife cuts off the ticket and a special lever shoots it out of the slot the national cash register company for prudential reasons do not wish the details of the internal machinery to be described; nor would it be an easy task even were the permission granted so we must imagine the extreme intricacy of the levers and wheels which perform all the tasks enumerated and turn aside to consider the origin and manufacture of the register which are both of interest the origin of the cash register is rather nebulous because twentyfive years ago several men were working on the same idea it first appeared as a practical machine in the offices of john and james ritty who owned stores and coalmines at dayton ohio james ritty helped and largely paid for the first experiments he needed a mechanical cashier for his own business and says that while on an ocean steamer en route to london the revolving machinery gave him the suggestion worked out on his return to dayton in the first dialmachine this gave way to the keymachine with its display tablet or indicator held up by a supporting bar moved back by knuckles on the vertical tablet rod illustration fig  the cut fig shows the right side of this key register the action of which is thus described by the national cash register company the key a when pressed with the finger at its ordinary positionmarked went down to the point marked being a lever and pivoted to its centre pressing down a key elevated its extreme point b this pushed up the tabletrod c having on its upper part the knuckle d this knuckle d pushed up took the position at e; that is the knuckle pushed back the supportingbar f and was pushed past it and held above it if the same operation were performed on another key the knuckle on its vertical rod going up would again push the supporting bar back which would release the first knuckled rod and leave the last one in its place this knuckled rod had on its upper end the display tablet or indicator g james and john ritty claimed and proved that they invented this but the attorney for the dayton company formed by them in the supreme court was compelled to admit that this mechanism was old yet if machines built like this were exhibited elsewhere they were at most only experimental models and none of them had ever gone into practical or commercial use in fact at this time nothing had been really contributed which was useful to the public or used by the public the trouble was that the knuckles being necessarily oiled held dust and dirt which interfered with their free movement and again a fivecent or tencent key would be used more than others and hence would become more worn as a practical result the tablets did not drop when wanted and the whole operation was thrown into confusion when one tablet went up the other tablet stayed up leaving a false indication the most valuable modification now made by these dayton inventors was to cease to rely on the knuckle to move back the supporting bar and to supply the place of this function by what became known as connecting mechanism especially designed for this purpose this was placed at the other or say the left side of the machine as you faced it cut no shows this new connecting mechanism the keys when pressed performed the functions as before on the right side of the machine viz to ring an alarmbell etc; but on the other or left side the key when pressed operated the connecting mechanism marked m n o p and q the key pressed down by its leverage pushed back a little lever q the further end of which pressed back the supporting bar f and released the previously exposed indicator g without relying on the knuckle to perform this function the supreme court of the united states said that the suggestion or idea to correct the old trouble and to drop the display tablet with certainty and to accomplish this by dividing the force used and applying a portion of it to the new connecting mechanism on the left side of the machine was fine invention and that the results are so important and the ingenuity displayed to bring them about is such that we are not disposed to deny the patentees the merit of invention the combination described in the first claim was clearly new to revert for a moment to the origin of the invention mr john ritty gives an account differing from that of his brother; but the two can probably be reconciled by supposing that the first ideas occurred simultaneously and were worked out in common late one summer night before dispersing home a group of men were in his store one of them said to the proprietor if you had a machine there to register the cash received you would get more of it and to the statement both owner and his clerks assented this raised a laugh but ritty who in spite of a large business which ranged over everything from a needle to a haystack did not make much profit by his sales took the suggestion seriously and put on his thinkingcap with the result that the first machine was patented and profits became very greatly increased illustration fig  before his machine had been perfected a rival was in the field mr thomas carney a man who had seen much life as a lumber merchant captain during the civil war explorer and railroad promoter settled down in at chicago to the manufacture of coinchangers when in various businesses he says we used gold and silver only and it seemed to be a sheer necessity to have something of a moneychanger to assist us in handling it and making change the custom then was to throw the different coins into a special receptacle marked for each i invented and in my own shop built this coinchanger the keys of which when touched would through the tube drop the coin into the hand as wanted at chicago we made five or six hundred of these coinchangers but by mistake placed the price too low and after some conference i became assured that there was not enough money in it a rich chicago manufacturer had become familiar with the urgent need of a cash register and the losses which followed in business without one the national at dayton had then been invented but had not then been perfected as it has been since parties at chicago agreed to put up the money if i would invent what would answer the purpose of a cash register and make a marketable machine i went home and gave the matter some hard thinking and talking with my son about the matter one night i looked up at the clock and said 'why harry there is the right thing sixty minutes make an hour; one hundred cents make a dollar all i have got to do is to change the wheels a little put some keys into it and there will be a thing which will register cents dimes and dollars just as that clock will register time in minutes and hours' in clocks the minute wheel when it has revolved to its sixty point throws its added result of sixty minutes over on to another wheel which takes up the story with one hour in place of the old sixty minutes the first wheel then begins again and goes its round a second complete revolution of the minute wheel throws another sixty minutes on to the hour and gives one more hour registered making two hours and so on i took some wheels and with pasteboard made hands and a machine it was very rough but i took it to my friends and explained it to them we went on but encountering difficulties and obstacles we merged our whole enterprise in the national i followed it and have since invented worked and helped along in the national cash register service i developed the no machine which the company began on and uses yet it is now in use in every civilised country for it can be made to register english money and any decimal currency in dayton contained five families the following year colonel robert patterson bought a large property in the neighbourhood and helped to develop a small town which has since grown into a thriving manufacturing centre his two sons john h patterson and frank j patterson bought out all the original proprietors of the national cash register greatly improved the machine's mechanism and built the huge factory which employs about men women and girls and is one of the bestequipped establishments in the world to promote both an economical output and the comfort of the employés the company's buildings at dayton cover square feet of floorspace and utilise acres of ground in convenience and attractiveness and for light heat and ventilation and all sanitary things these structures are designed to be models of any used for factory purposes a machine is made and sold every minutes in the dayton berlin and toronto factories collectively according to its destination it records dollars shillings marks kronen korona francs kroner guildens pesetas pesos milreis rupees or roubles registers are also made to meet the needs of the celestials and the japanese so necessary is it for these machines to be ever improving that the company with a wisdom that prevails more largely perhaps in the united states than elsewhere offer substantial rewards to the employé who records in a book kept specially for the purpose any suggestion which the committee after due examination consider likely to improve some detail of mechanism or manufacture five departments are entirely devoted to experiments carried out by a corps of inventors working with a special body of skilled mechanics new patents accrue so fast as a result of this organised research that the national company now owns letters patent in the united states and in foreign countries many ideas come from outside if they appear profitable they are bought and turned over to the patents department which hands them on to the experimenters these build an experimental model which differs in many respects from the types hitherto manufactured a cash register must be above all things strong so that it can bear a heavy blow without getting out of order and must retain its accuracy under all conditions the model finished it goes before the inspectors who thump it hammer it almost turn it inside out and send it back to the factory committee with reports on any defects that may have come to light if the inspectors can only knock the machine out of time they consider that they have done their duty; for they argue that if weaknesses thus developed are put right no purchaser will ever be able to dislocate the machinery if he stops short of an actual brutal assault with violence next comes the building of the commercial type which will be sold by the thousand the machine goes down to the toolmakers a select board of seventyfive members who list all the parts and say how many drilljigs mills fixtures gauges etc are necessary to make every part then they draw out an approximate estimate of the cost of producing the tools and after they have listed the parts they turn them over to the various departments such as the draftingroom blacksmiths' shop pattern shop foundry etc after which the various parts are machined up then the toolmaker assembles together the various tools and makes a number of the parts that each tool is designed for; so that when all the tools have done their preliminary work the makers possess about fifty machines in bits these are assembled to prove whether the tools do their business efficiently if any part shows an inclination to jam or otherwise misbehave itself the tool responsible is altered till its products are satisfactory then and only thena period of perhaps two years may have elapsed since the model was first put in handthe company begins to entertain a prospect of getting back some of the moneyany sum up to £spent in preparations but they know that if people will only buy they won't have much fault to find with their purchase preparations brings success is the motto of the ncr so the company spares no money and is content to have £ locked up in its automatic screwmaking machines alone! human as well as inanimate machinery is well tended under the roof of the ncr the committee believe that a healthy comfortable employé means goodand therefore profitablework; and that to work well employés must eat and play well they therefore provide their boys with gardens feet wide by feet in length; and pay an experienced gardener to direct their efforts to encourage a start bulbs seeds slips etc are supplied free; while prizes of considerable value help to stimulate competition one day ten years or more ago mr patterson saw a factory girl trying to warm her tin bucket of cold coffee at the steam heater in the workshop he is a humane man and acting on the unintentional hint he built a lunchroom which contains besides accommodation for people a piano and sewingmachine which the women can use during their noon recess of eighty minutes a cooking school dancing classes and literary club are all available to members the company encourages its workers to own the houses they inhabit and to make them as beautiful as their leisure will permit mr mosely who took over to america an industrial commission of experts in and an educational commission in the following year paid visits on both occasions to the national cash register works in a speech to the committee he said i do not know of any institution in the world which offers so beautiful an illustration of the proper working conditions as the national cash register company your president has asked me to criticise i cannot find anything to criticise in this factory i have never seen such conditions in any other factory in the world nor have i ever seen so many bright and intelligent faces as we have seen at luncheon in both the men's and women's dining rooms i believe this factory is as nearly perfect as social conditions will permit

industrial biographies chap xiii chapter iii workshop machinery the latheplaning machinesthe steam hammerhydraulic toolselectrical tools in the shipyard  when i first entered this city said mr william fairbairn in an inaugural address to the british association at manchester in the whole of the machinery was executed by hand there were neither planing slotting nor shaping machines and with the exception of very imperfect lathes and a few drills the preparatory operations of construction were effected entirely by the hands of the workmen now everything is done by machine tools with a degree of accuracy which the unaided hand could never accomplish the automaton or selfacting machine tool has within itself an almost creative power; in fact so great are its powers of adaptation that there is no operation of the human hand that it does not imitate if such things could be said with justice fortyfive years ago what would mr fairbairn think could he see the wonderful machinery with which the presentday workshop is equippedmachinery as relatively superior to the devices he speaks of as they were superior to the unaided efforts of the human hand? invention never stands still the wonder of one year is on the scrapheap of abandoned machines almost before another twelve months have passed some important detail has been improved to secure ease or economy in working and a more efficient successor steps into its place in his curious and original erewhon mr samuel butler depicts a community which from the fear that machinery should become too ingenious and eventually drain away man's capacity for muscular and mental action has risen in revolt against the automaton broken up all machines which had been in use for less than yearswith the exception of specimens reserved for the national museumsand reverted to hand labour his treatment of the dangers attending the increased employment of lifeless mechanisms as a substitute for physical effort does not however show sympathy with the erewhonians; since their abandonment of invention had obviously placed them at the mercy of any other race retaining the devices so laboriously perfected during the ages and we on our part should be extremely sorry to part with the inanimate helpers which in every path of life render the act of living more comfortable and less toilsome so dependent are we on machinery that we owe a double debt to the machines which create machines a big factory houses the parents which send out their children to careers of usefulness throughout the world we often forget in our admiration of the offspring the source from which they originated our bicycles so admirably adapted to easy locomotion owe their existence to a hundred delicate machines the express engine hurrying forward over the iron way is but an assemblage of parts which have been beaten cut twisted planed and otherwise handled by mighty machines each as wonderful as the locomotive itself but then we don't see these this and following chapters will therefore be devoted to a few peeps at the great tools employed in the world's workshops if you consider a moment you will soon build up a formidable list of objects in which circularity is a necessary or desirable featurewheels shafts plates legs of tables walkingsticks pillars parts of instruments wire and so on the hindu turner whose assistant revolves with a string a wooden block centred between two short spiked posts let into the ground while he himself applies the tool is at one end of the scale of lathe users; at the other we have the workman who tends the giant machine slowly shaping the exterior of a inch gun a propeller shaft or a marble column all aim at the same objectperfect rotundity of surface the artisans of the middle ages have left us in beautiful balusters and cathedral screens ample proofs that they were skilled workmen with the turninglathe at the time of the huguenot persecutions large numbers of french artificers crossed the channel to england bringing with them lathes which could cut intricate figures by means of wheels eccentrics and other devices of a comparatively complicated kind the french had undoubtedly got far ahead of the english in this branch of the mechanical arts owing no doubt to the fact that the french noblesse had condescended to include turnery among their aristocratic hobbies with the larger employment of metal in all industries the need for handling it easily is increased much greater accuracy generally distinguishes metal as compared with woodwork in turning a piece of work on the oldfashioned lathe the workman applied and guided his tool by means of muscular strength the work was made to revolve and the turner holding the cutting tool firmly upon the long straight guiding edge of the rest along which he carried it and pressing its point firmly against the article to be turned was thus enabled to reduce its surface to the required size and shape some dexterous turners were able with practice and carefulness to execute very clever pieces of work by this simple means but when the article to be turned was of considerable size and especially when it was of metal the expenditure of muscular strength was so great that the workman soon became exhausted the slightest variation in the pressure of the tool led to an irregularity of surface; and with the utmost care on the workman's part he could not avoid occasionally cutting a little too deep in consequence of which he must necessarily go over the surface again to reduce the whole to the level of that accidentally cut too deep and thus possibly the job would be altogether spoiled by the diameter of the article under operation being made too small for its intended purpose any modern worker is spared this labour and worry by the device known as the sliderest its name implies that it at once affords a rigid support for the tool and also the means of traversing the tool in a straight line parallel to the metal face on which work is being done the introduction of the sliderest is due to the ingenuity of mr henry maudslay who at the commencement of the nineteenth century was a foreman in the workshop of mr joseph bramah inventor of the famous hydraulic press and locks which bear his name his rest could be moved along the bed of the lathe by a screw and clamped in any position desired fellowworkmen at first spoke derisively of maudslay's gocart; but men competent to judge its real value had more kindly words to say concerning it when it had been adapted to machines of various types for planing as well as turning mr james nasmyth went so far as to state that its influence in improving and extending the use of machinery has been as great as that produced by the improvement of the steamengine in respect to perfecting manufactures and extending commerce inasmuch as without the aid of the vast accession to our power of producing perfect mechanism which it at once supplied we could never have worked out into practical and profitable forms the conceptions of those master minds who during the last half century have so successfully pioneered the way for mankind the steamengine itself which supplies us with such unbounded power owes its present perfection to this most admirable means of giving to metallic objects the most precise and perfect geometrical forms how could we for instance have good steamengines if we had not the means of boring out a true cylinder or turning a true pistonrod or planing a valve face? it is this alone which has furnished us with the means of carrying into practice the accumulated results of scientific investigation on mechanical subjects the screwcutting lathe is so arranged that the sliderest is moved along with its tool at a uniform speed by gear wheels actuated by the mechanism rotating the object to be turned by changing the wheels the rate of feed may be varied so that at every revolution the tool travels from of an inch upwards along the surface of its work this regularity of action adds greatly to the value of the sliderest; and the screw device also enables the workman to chase a thread of absolutely constant pitch on a metal bar; so that a screwcutting lathe is not only a shaping machine but also the equivalent of a whole armoury of stocks and dies some lathes have rests which carry several tools held at different distances from its axis the cuts following one another deeper and deeper into the metal in a manner exactly similar to the harvesting of a field of corn by a succession of reaping machines the recent improvements in toolsteel render it possible to get a much deeper cut than formerly without fear of injury to the tool from overheating this results in a huge saving of time for the boring of large cylinders an upright lathe is generally used as the weight of the metal might cause a dangerous sag were the cylinder attached horizontally by one end to a facingplate huge wheels can also be turned in this type of machine up to feet or more in diameter; and where the crossbar carrying the tools is fitted with several toolboxes two or more operations may be conducted simultaneously such as the turning of the flange the boring of the axle hole and the facing of the rim sides illustration a gun lathe feet long between centres for boring and turning guns which with their mountings weigh tons when complete the makers are the nilesbementpond co of new york perhaps the most imposing of all lathes are those which handle large cannon and propeller shafts such as may be seen in the works of sir w g armstrong whitworth and company; of messrs vickers sons and maxim; and of other armament and shipbuilding firms the midvale steel company have in their shops at hamilton ohio a monster boring lathe which will take in a shaft feet long inches in diameter and bore a hole from one end to the other inches in diameter to do this the lathe must attack the shaft at both ends simultaneously as a single boring bar of feet would not be stiff enough to keep the hole cylindrical the shaft is placed in a revolving chuck in the central portion of the lathewhich has a total length of over feetand supported further by two revolving ring rests on each side towards the extremities with work so heavy the feeding up of the tool to its surface cannot be done conveniently by hand control and the boring bars are therefore advanced by hydraulic pressure a very ingenious arrangement ensuring that the pressure shall never become excessive perhaps the type of lathe most interesting to the layman is the turret lathe generally used for the manufacture of articles turned out in great numbers the headstockie the revolving part which grips the object to be turnedis hollow so that a rod may be passed right through it into the vicinity of the tools which are held in a hexagon turret one tool projecting from each of its sides when one tool has been finished with the workman does not have the trouble of taking it out of the rest and putting another in its place; he merely turns the turret round and brings another instrument opposite the work if the objectsay a watercockrequires five operations performing on it in the lathe the corresponding tools are arranged in their proper order round the turret stops are arranged so that as soon as any tool has advanced as far as is necessary a tripaction checks the motion of the turret which is pulled back and given a turn to make it ready for the next attack one of the advantages of the turret lathe particularly of the automatic form which shifts round the toolbox without human intervention is its power of relieving the operator of the purely mechanical part of his work those who are familiar with the inside of some of our large workshops will have noticed men and boys who make the same thing all day and every day and are themselves not far removed from machines the articles they make are generally small and very rapidly produced and the endless repetition of the same movements on the part of the operator is very tedious to watch and must be infinitely more so to perform such an occupation is not elevating and those engaged in it cannot take much interest in their work or become fitted for a better position when this work is done by an automatic lathe the machine performs the necessary operations and the man supplies the intelligence and by exercising his thinking powers becomes more valuable to his employers and himself the introduction of new machines and methods generally has a stimulating effect on the whole shop whatever the erewhonians might say the hubs and spindles of bicycles are cut from the solid bar by these automata; the tender has merely to feed them with metal and they go on smoothing shaping and cutting off until the material is all used up the existence of such lathes largely accounts for the low price of our useful metal steeds at the present time a great amount of shaping is now done by milling cutters in preference to firmlyfixed edged tools the cutter is a rod or disc which has its sides end or circumference serrated with deep teeth shaped to the section of the cut needed revolving at a tremendous speed it quickly bites its way into anything it meets just so far as a stop allows it to go one of the most ingenious machines to which the milling tool has been fitted is the wellknown blanchard lathe which copies generally in wood repetitive work such as the stocks for guns and rifles the lathe has two sets of centresone for the copy the other for the modelparallel on the same bed and turned at equal speeds and in the same direction by a train of gear wheels the milling cutter is attached to a frame from which a disc projects and is pressed by a spring against the model as the latter revolves its irregular shape causes the disc frame and cutter to move towards or away from its centre and therefore towards or away from the centre of the copy which has all superfluities whisked off by the cutter the frame is gradually moved along the model reproducing in the rough block a section similar to the part of the model which it has reached the selfcentring chuck is an accessory which has proved invaluable for saving time it may most easily be described as a circular plate which screws on to the inner end of the mandrel the spindle imparting motion to the object being machined and has in its face three slots radiating from the centre at angles of ° in each slot slides a stepped jaw the under side of which is scored with concentric grooves engaging with a helical scroll turned by a key and worm gear acting on its circumference the jaws approach or recede from the centre symmetrically so that if a circular object is gripped its centre will be in line with the axis of the lathe whether for gripping a tiny drill or a large wheel the selfcentring chuck is indispensable  planingmachines not less important in engineering than the truly curved surface is the true plane in which as euclid would say any two points being taken the straight line between them lies wholly in that superficies the lathe depends for its efficiency on the perfect flatness of all areas which should be flatthe guides the surface plates the bottom and sides of the headstock and above all of the slide rest for making plane metal superficies a machine must first be constructed which itself is above suspicion; but when once built it creates machines like itself capable of reproducing others ad infinitum many amateur carpenters pride themselves on the beautiful smoothness of the boards over which they have run their jack planes yet as compared with the bed of a lathe their best work will appear very inaccurate the engineer's planingmachine in no way resembles its wooden relative in the place of a blade projecting just a little way through a surface which prevents it from cutting too deep into the substance over which it is moving we have a steel chisel very similar to the cutting tools of a lathe attached to a frame passing up and down over a bed to which the member holding the chisel is perfectly parallel the article to be planed is rigidly attached to the bed and travels with it between every two strokes the tool is automatically moved sideways so that no two cuts shall be in the same line after the whole surface has been roughed a finishing cutter is brought in action and the process is repeated with the business edge of the tool rather nearer to the bed joseph clement a contemporary of babbage maudslay and nasmyth is usually regarded as the inventor of the planingmachine by he had finished a planer in which the tool was stationary and the work moving under it on a rolling bed two cutters were attached to the overhead cross rail so that travel in either direction might be utilised the bed of the machine on which the work was laid passed under the cutters on perfectly true rollers or wheels lodged and held in their bearings as accurately as the best mandrel could be and having set screws acting against their ends totally preventing all endmotion the machine was bedded on a massive and solid foundation of masonry in heavy blocks the support at all points being so complete as effectually to destroy all tendency to vibration with the object of securing full round and quiet cuts the rollers on which the planingmachine travelled were so true that clement himself used to say of them if you were to put a paper shaving under one of the rollers it would at once stop the rest nor was this an exaggerationthe entire mechanism notwithstanding its great size being as true and accurate as a watch mr clement next made a revolving attachment for the bed in which bodies could be revolved under the cutter on an axis parallel to the direction of travel according to the wish of the operator the object was converted into a cylinder cone or prism by its movements under the planingtool so efficient was the machine that it earned its maker upwards of ten pounds a day at the rate of about eighteen shillings a square foot until rivals appeared in the field and finally reduced the cost of planing to a few pence for the same area there are two main patterns of planes now in general use the first follows the original design of clement; the second has a fixed bed but a moving tool where the work is very heavy as in the case of armourplates for battleships the power required to suddenly reverse the motion of a vast mass of metal is enormous many times greater than the energy expended on the actual planing for this reason the movingbed machines have had to be greatly improved; and in some cases replaced by fixedbed planers it is an impressive sight to watch one of these huge mechanisms reducing a rough plate weighing twenty tons or more to a smoothness which would shame the best billiard table the machine which towers thirty feet into the air and completely dwarfs the attendant who has it as thoroughly under control as if it were a small file bites great shining strips forty feet long maybe off the surface of the passive metal and leaves a series of grooves as truly parallel as the art of man can make them there is no fuss no sticking no stop no noise; the force of electricity or steam transmitted through wonderfully cut and arranged gearwheels is irresistible the tool so hard that a journey through many miles of steel has no appreciable effect on its edge shears its way remorselessly over the surface which presently may be tempered to a toughness resembling its own if you want to resharpen the tool it will be no good to attack it with any known metal but somewhere in the works there is a machine whose buzzing emerywheels are more than a match for it and rapidly grind the blunted edge into its former shape so that it is ready to flay another plate one skin at a time planingmachines are of many shapes some have an upright on each side of the bed limiting the width of the work they can take; others are opensided one support of extra strength replacing the two enabling the introduction of a plate twice as broad as the bed others again are built on the verge of a pit so that they may cut the edges of an upended plate and make it fit against its fellows so truly that you could not slip a sheet of paper edgeways between them thus has man so frail and delicate in himself shaped metal till it can torture its kind to suit his will which he makes known to it by opening this valve or pulling on that lever not only does he flay it but pierces it through and through; twists it into all manner of shapes; hacks masses off as easily as he would cut slices from a loaf; squeezes it in terrible presses to a fraction of its original thickness; and otherwise so treats it that we are glad that our scientific observations have as yet discovered no sentience in the substances reduced to our service  the steam hammer the scandinavian god thor was a marvellous blacksmith thursday should remind us weekly of odin's son from whose hammer flashed the lightning; and through him of vulcan toiling at his smithy in the crater of vesuvius in spite of the pictures drawn for us by pagan mythologists of their godsmiths we are left with the doubt whether these beings if materialised might not themselves be somewhat alarmed by the steam hammer which mere mortals wield so easily the forge is without dispute the showplace of a big factory where huge blocks of metal feel the heavy hand of steam as children we watched the blacksmith at his anvil attracted and yet halfterrified by the sparkshowers flying from a whitehot horseshoe and even the adult long used to startling sights might well be fascinated and dismayed by the terrific blows dealt on glowing ingots by the mechanical sledge illustration a steam hammer at work in woolwich arsenal forging a steel ingot for the inner tube of a big gun it delivers a blow equivalent to the momentum of a falling mass weighing tons as speech is inaudible the foreman gives hand signals to direct his men who wear large canvas fingerless gloves to protect their hands from the intense heat james nasmyth the inventor of this useful machine was the son of a landscape painter who from his earliest youth had taken great interest in scientific and mechanical subjects of all kinds at fifteen he made a steamengine to grind his father's paints and five years later a steam carriage that ran many a mile with eight persons on it after keeping it in action two months he says in an account of his early life to the satisfaction of all who were interested in it my friends allowed me to dispose of it and i sold ita great bargainafter which the engine was used in driving a small factory i may mention that in that engine i employed the waste steam to cause an increased draught by its discharge up the chimney this important use of waste steam had been introduced by george stephenson some years before though entirely unknown to me this interesting peep at the infancy of the motor carriage reveals mechanical capabilities of no mean order in young james he soon entered the service of mr joshua field henry maudslay's partner and in set up a business on his own account at manchester at this date the nearest approach to the modern steam hammer was the tilt hammer operated by horse water or steampower it resembled an ordinary hand hammer on a very large scale but as it could be raised only a small distance above its anvil it became less effective as the size of the work increased owing to the fall being gagged in mr nasmyth interviewed the directors of the great western steamship company with regard to the manufacture of some unusually powerful tools which they needed for forging the paddleshaft of the great britain as the invention of the steamengine had demanded the improvement of turning methods so now the increase in the size of steamboats showed the insufficiency of forging machinery mr nasmyth put on his thinkingcap evidently the thing needed was a method for raising a very heavy mass of metal easily to a good height so that its great weight might fall with crushing force on the object between it and the anvil how to raise it? brilliant idea! steam! in a moment nasmyth had mentally pictured an inverted steam cylinder rested on a solid upright overhanging the anvil and a block of iron attached to its pistonrod all that would then be necessary was to admit steam to the under side of the piston until the block had risen to its full height and to suddenly open a valve which would cut off the steam supply and allow the vapour already in the cylinder to escape by the next post he sent a sketch to the company who approved his design heartily but were unable to use it since the need for the paddleshaft had already been nullified by the substitution of a screw as the motive power of their ship poor nasmyth knew that he had discovered a good thing but british forgemasters with a want of originality that amounted to sheer blind stupidity refused to look at the innovation we have not orders enough to keep in work the forgehammers we have they wrote and we don't want any new ones however improved they may be his invention therefore appeared doomed to failure help however came from france in the person of mr schneider founder of the famous creusot iron works notorious afterwards as the birthplace of the boer long toms mr nasmyth happened to be away when mr schneider and a friend called at the manchester works but his partner mr gaskell showed the french visitors round the works and also told them of the proposed steam hammer the designs were brought out so that its details might be clearly explained years afterwards nasmyth returned the visit and saw in the creusot works a crankshaft so large that he asked how it had been forged by means of your steam hammer came the reply you may imagine nasmyth's surprise on finding the very machine at work in france which his own countrymen had so despised and his delight over its obvious success on returning home he at once raised money enough to secure a patent protected his invention and began to manufacture what has been described as one of the most perfect of artificial machines and noblest triumphs of mind over matter that modern english engineers have developed a few weeks saw the firsta cwthammer at work people flocked to watch its precision its beauty of action and the completeness of control which could arrest it at any point of its descent so instantaneously as to crack without smashing a nut laid on the anvil its advantages were so obvious that its adoption soon became general and in the course of a few years nasmyth steam hammers were to be found in every wellappointed workshop both at home and abroad nasmyth's invention was improved upon in by mr robert wilson his partner and successor he added an automatic arrangement which raised the tup or head automatically from the metal it struck so that time was saved and loss of heat to the ingot was also avoided the beauty of the balance valve as it was called will be more clearly understood if we remember that the travel of the hammer is constantly increasing as the piece on the anvil becomes thinner under successive blows under the influence of this very ingenious valve every variety of blow could be dealt by simply altering the position of a tappet lever by means of two screws a blow of the exact force required could be repeated an indefinite number of times it became a favourite amusement to place a wineglass containing an egg upon the anvil and let the block descend upon it with its quick motion; and so nice was its adjustment and so delicate its mechanism that the great block weighing perhaps several tons could be heard playing tap tap upon the egg without even cracking the shell when at a signal given to the man in charge down would come the great mass and the egg and glass would be apparently as walter savage landor has it 'blasted into space' later on mr wilson added an equally important feature in the shape of a doubleaction handgear which caused the steam to act on the top as well as the bottom of the piston thus more than doubling the effect of the hammer the largest hammer ever made was that erected by the bethlehem iron company of pennsylvania the tup weighed tons after being in use for three years the owners consigned it to the scrapheap as inferior to the hydraulic press for the manufacture of armourplate though it had cost them £ they then erected in its stead for an equal sum of money a ton pressure hydraulic press which fitly succeeds it as the most powerful of its kind in the world the change was made for three reasons first that the impact of so huge a block of metal necessitates the anvil being many times as heavy and even then the shock to surrounding machinery may be very severe secondly the larger the forging to be hammered the less is the reaction of the anvil so that all the force of the blow tends to be absorbed by the side facing the hammer; whereas with a small bar the anvil's inertia would have almost as much effect as the actual blow thirdly the blow of the hammer is so instantaneous that the metal has not time to flow properly and this leads to imperfect forgings the surface of which may have been cracked for very large work therefore the hammer is going out of fashion and the press coming in though for lighter jobs it is still widely used before leaving the subject we may glance at the doubleheaded horizontal hammer such as is to be found in the forgeshop of the horwich railway works two hammers carried on rails and rollers advance in unison from each side and pound work laid on a support between them each acts as anvil to the other while doing its full share of the work so that not only is a great deal of weight saved but shocks are almost entirely absorbed; while the fact that each hammer need make a blow of only half the length of what would be required from a single hammer enables twice as many blows to be delivered in a given time  hydraulic tools before discussing these in detail we shall do well to trace the history of the bramah press which may be said to be their parent since the principle employed in most hydraulic devices for the workshop as also the idea of using water as a means of transmitting power under pressure are justly attributed to joseph bramah if you take a dive into the sea and fall flat on the surface instead of entering at the graceful angle you intended you will feel for some time afterwards as if an enemy had slapped you violently on the chest and stomach you have learnt by sad experience that water which seems to offer so little resistance to a body drawn slowly through it is remarkably hard if struck violently in fact if enclosed it becomes more incompressible than steel without in any way losing its fluidity we possess in water therefore a very useful agent for transmitting energy from one point to another shove one end of a column of water and it gives a push to anything at its other end; but then it must be enclosed in a tube to guide its operation by a natural law all fluids press evenly on every unit of a surface that confines them you may put sand into a bucket with a bottom of cardboard and beat hard upon the surface of the sand without knocking out the bottom the friction between the sand particles and the bucket's sides entirely absorbs the blow but if water were substituted for sand and struck with an object that just fitted the bucket so as to prevent the escape of liquid the bottom and sides too would be ripped open the writer of this book once fired a candle out of a gun at a hermetically sealed tin of water to see what the effect would be another candle had already been fired through an iron plate of an inch thick the impact slightly compressed the water in the tin which gave back all the energy in a recoil which split the sheet metal open and flung portions of it many feet into the air but the candle never got through the side this affords a very good idea of the almost absolute incompressibility of a liquid we may now return to history joseph bramah was born in at barnsley in yorkshire as the son of a farm labourer his lot in life would probably have been to follow the plough had not an accident to his right ankle compelled him to earn his living in some other way he therefore turned carpenter and developed such an aptitude for mechanics that we find him when forty years old manufacturing the locks with which his name is associated and six years later experimenting with the hydraulic press this may be described simply as a large cylinder in which works a solid piston of a diameter almost equal to that of the bore connected to a force pump every stroke of the pump drives a little water into the cylinder and as the water pressure is the same throughout the total stress on the piston end is equal to that on the pump plunger multiplied by the number of times that the one exceeds the other in area suppose then that the plunger is one inch in diameter and the piston one foot and that a man drives down the plunger with a force of lbs then the total pressure on the piston end will be × lbs; but for every inch that the plunger has travelled the piston moves only of an inch thus illustrating the law that what is gained in time is lost in power and vice versâ the great difficulty encountered by bramah was the prevention of leakage between the piston and the cylinder walls if he packed it so tightly that no water could pass then the piston jammed; if the packing was eased then the leak recommenced bramah tried all manner of expedients without success at last his foreman henry maudslayalready mentioned in connection with the lathe sliderestconceived an idea which showed real genius by reason of its very simplicity why not he said let the water itself give sufficient tightness to the packing which must be a collar of stout leather with an inverted ushaped section? this suggestion saved the situation a recess was turned in the neck of the cylinder at the point formerly occupied by the stuffingbox and into this the collar was set the edges pointing downwards when water entered under pressure it forced the edges in different directions one against the piston the other against the wall of the recess with a degree of tightness proportioned to the pressure as soon as the pressure was removed the collar collapsed and allowed the piston to pass back into the cylinder without friction a similar device to turn to smaller things for a moment is employed in a cycle tyre inflater a cupshaped leather being attached to the rear end of the piston to seal it during the pressure stroke though acting as an inlet valve for the suction stroke what we owe to joseph bramah and henry maudslay for their joint inventionthe honour must be divided like that of designing the steam hammer between nasmyth and wilsonit would indeed be hard to estimate wherever steady but enormous effort is required for lifting huge girders houses ships; for forcing wheels off their axles; for elevators; for advancing the boring shield of a tunnel; for compressing hay wool cotton wood even metal; for riveting bending drilling steel platesthere you will find some modification of the hydraulic press useful if not indispensable however as we are now prepared for a consideration of details we may return to our workshop and see what water is doing there outside stands a cylindrical object many feet broad and high which can move up and down in vertical guides if you peep underneath you notice the shining steel shaft which supports the entire weight of this tank or coffer filled with heavy articlesstones scrap iron etc the shaft is the pistonplunger of a very long cylinder connected by pipes to pumping engines and hydraulic machines it and the mass it bears up serves as a reservoir of energy if the pumping engines were coupled up directly to the hydraulic tools whenever a workman desired to use a press drill or stamp as the case might be he would have to send a signal to the engineman to start the pumps and another signal to tell him when to stop this would lead to great waste of time and a danger of injuring the tackle from over driving but with an accumulator there is always a supply of water under pressure at command for as soon as the ram is nearly down the engines are automatically started to pump it up again in short the accumulator is to hydraulic machinery what their bag is to bagpipes or the air reservoir to an organ in large towns highpressure water is distributed through special mains by companies who make a business of supplying factories engineering works and other places where there is need for it though not sufficient need to justify the occupiers in laying down special pumping plant london can boast five central distributing stations where engines of hp are engaged in keeping nine large accumulators full to feed miles of pipes varying in diameter from seven inches downwards the pressure is lbs to the square inch liverpool has twentythree miles of pipes under lbs pressure; manchester seventeen miles under lbs to these may be added glasgow hull birmingham geneva paris berlin antwerp and many other large cities in both europe and the united states for very special purposes such as making metal forgings pressures up to twelve tons to the square inch may be required to produce this intensifiers are used ie presses worked from the ordinary hydraulic mains which pump water into a cylinder of larger diameter connected with the forging press the largest english forging press is to be found in the openshaw works of sir w g armstrong whitworth and company its duty is to consolidate armourplate ingots by squeezing preparatory to their passing through the rolling mills it has one huge ram inches in diameter into the cylinder of which water is pumped by engines of hp under a pressure of lbs to the square inch which gives a total ram force of tons it has a total height of feet is feet wide and feet long and weighs tons on each side of the anvil is a trench fitted with platforms and machinery for moving the ingot across the ingot block two ton electric cranes with hydraulic lifting cylinders serve the press illustration a huge hydraulic press the ton pressure whitworth hydraulic press used for consolidating steel ingots for armourplating water is forced into the ram cylinder at a pressure of three tons to the square inch notice the man to the left of the press the bethlehem works squeezer has two rams each of much smaller diameter than the armstrongwhitworth but operated by a tons pressure to the square inch it handles ingots of over tons weight for armourplating in mr william corey of pittsburg took out a patent for toughening nickel steel plates by subjecting them while heated to a temperature of ° f to great compression which elongates them only slightly though reducing their thickness considerably the heating of a large plate takes from ten to twenty hours; it is then ready to be placed between the jaws of the big press which are about a foot wide the plate is moved forward between the jaws after each stroke until the entire surface has been treated at one stroke a inch plate is reduced to inches and subsequent squeezings give it a final thickness of inches its length has meanwhile increased from to feet or in that proportion while its breadth has remained practically unaltered a simple sum shows that metal which originally occupied cubic inches has now been compressed into cubic inches this alteration being effected without any injury to the surface a plate very tough inside and very hard outside is made the plate is next reheated to ° f and allowed to cool very gradually to a low temperature to anneal it then once again the furnaces are started to bring it back to ° when cold water is squirted all over the surface to give it a proper temper if it bends and warps at all during this process a slight reheating and a second treatment in the press restores its shape the hydraulic press is also used for bending or stamping plates in all manners of forms you may see inch steel slabs being quietly squeezed in a pair of huge dies till they have attained a semicircular shape to fit them for the protection of a manofwar's biggun turret; or thinner stuff having its ends turned over to make a flange; or still slenderer metal stamped into the shape of a complete steel boat as easily as the tinsmith stamps tartlet moulds in another workshop a pair of massive jaws worked by water power are breaking up iron pigs into pieces suitable for the melting furnace the manufacture of munitions of war also calls for the aid of this powerful ally take the fieldgun and its ammunition the gun itself is a steel barrel hydraulically forged and afterwards wirewound; the carriage is built up of steel plates flanged and shaped in hydraulic presses; the wheels have their naves composed of hydraulically flanged and corrugated steel discs and even the tyres are forced on cold by hydraulic tyresetters the rams of which are powerful enough to reduce the diameter of the welded tyre until the latter tightly nips the wheel the shells for the gun are punched and drawn by powerful hydraulic presses and the copper drivingbands are fixed on the projectiles in special hydraulic presses quickfiring cartridgecases are capped drawn and headed by an hydraulic press whose huge mass always impresses the uninitiated as absurdly out of proportion to the small size of the finished case and finally the cordite firing charge is dependent on hydraulic presses for its density and shape the press for placing the drivingband on a shell is particularly interesting after the shell has been shaped and its exterior turned smooth and true a groove is cut round it near the rear end into this groove a band of copper is forced to prevent the leakage of gas from the firing charge past the shell and also to bite the rifling which imparts a rotatory motion to the shell the press for performing the operation has six cylinders and rams arranged spokewise inside a massive steel ring; the rams carrying concave heads which when the full stroke is made meet at the centre so as to form a complete circle pressure is admitted says mr petch to the cylinders by copper pipes connected up to a circular distributing pipe the press takes water from the pounds main for the first inch of the stroke and for the last inch water pressure at tons per square inch is used the total pressure on all the rams to band a inch shell is only tons but for a inch shell no less than tons is necessary  electric tools in a shipyard of late years electricity has taken a very prominent part in workshop equipment on account of the ease with which it can be applied to a machine the freedom from belting and overhead gear which it gives and its greater economy in a latheshop where only half the lathes may be in motion at a time the shafting and the belts for the total number is constantly whirling absorbing uselessly a lot of power if however a separate motor be fitted to each lathe the workman can switch it on and off at his pleasure the new york shipbuilding company a very modern enterprise depends mainly on electrical power for driving its machinery in preference to belting compressed air or water let us stroll through the various shops and note the uses to which the current has been harnessed before entering our attention is arrested by a huge gantry crane borne by two columns which travel on rails from the cross girder or bridge feet long hang two lifting magnets worked by hp motors which raise the load at the rate of feet per minute motors of equal power move the whole gantry along its rails over the great piles of steel plates and girders from which it selects victims to feed the maw of the shops the main building is of enormous size covering with its single roof no less than eighteen acres! just imagine four acres of skylights and two acres of windows and you may be able to calculate the little glazier's bill that might result from a bad hailstorm in this immense chamber are included the machine boiler blacksmith plate frame pipe and mould shops the general storerooms the building ways and outfitting slips the material which enters the plate and storage rooms at one end does not leave the building until it goes out as a part of the completed ship for which it was intended when the vessel is ready to enter service; there are installed in one main building and under one roof all the material and machinery necessary for the construction of the largest ship known to commerce and eight sets of shipways built upon masonry foundations covered by roofs of steel and glass and spanned by cranes up to tons lifting capacity are practically as much a part of the immense main building as the boiler shop or machine shop a huge ton crane of foot span dominates the machineshop and shipways at a height of feet it toys with a big engine or boiler picking it up when the riveters caulkers and fitters have done their work and dropping it gently into the bowels of a partlyfinished vessel a number of smaller cranes run about with their loads those which handle plates are like the big gantry already referred to equipped with powerful electromagnets which fix like leeches on the metal and will not let go their hold until the current is broken by the pressing of a button somewhere on the bridge sometimes several plates are picked up at once and then it is pretty to see how the man in charge drops them in succession one here another there by merely opening and closing the switch very quickly so that the plate furthest from the magnets falls before the magnetism has passed out of the nearer plates another interesting type is the extensionarm crane which shoots out an arm between two pillars grips something and pulls it back into the main aisle down which it travels without impediment on every side are fresh wonders here is an immense rolling machine fed with plates feet wide which bends the inch thick metal as if it were so much pastry; or turns over the edges neatly at the command of a hp motor there we have an electric plateplaner scraping the surface of a sheet half the length of a cricket pitch as soon as a stroke is finished the bed reverses automatically while the tool turns over to offer its edge to the metal approaching from the other side all so quietly yet irresistibly done! now mark these punches as they bite inch holes through steel plates over an inch thick one every two seconds a man cutting wads out of cardboard could hardly perform his work so quickly and well almost as horribly resistless is the circular saw which eats its way quite unconcernedly through bars six inches square or snips lengths off steel beams what is that strangelooking machine over there? it has three columns which move on circular rails round a table in the centre up and down each column passes a stage carrying with it a workman and an electric drill working four spindles look! here comes a crane with a boiler shell the plates of which have been bolted in position the crane lets down its load endup on to the table and trots off while the three workmen move their columns round till the twelve drills are opposite their work then whirr! a dozen twisted steel points ranged in three sets of four one drill above the other bite into the boiler plates opening out holes at mathematically correct intervals all down the overlapping seamplates this job done the columns move round the boiler and their drills pierce it first near the lower edge then near the upper the crane returns grips the cylinder and bears it off to the riveters who are waiting with their hydraulic presses to squeeze the rivets into the holes just made and shape their heads into neat hemispheres as it swings through the air the size of the boiler is dwarfed by its surroundings; but if you had put a rule to it on the table you would have found that it measured feet in diameter and as many in length a few months hence furnaces will rage in its stomach and cause it to force tons of steam into the mighty cylinders driving some majestic vessel across the atlantic we pass giant lathes busy on the propeller shafts huge boring mills which slowly smooth the interior of a cylinder planers which face the valve slides; and we arrive eyeweary at the launchingways where an ocean liner is being given her finishing touches then we begin to moralise that foot floating palace is a concretion of parts shaped punched cut planed bored fixed by electricity where does man come in? well he harnessed the current he guided it he said do this and it did it does not that seem to be his fair share of the work? footnotes  industrial biographies dr s smiles  industrial biographies  industrial biographies  chambers's encyclopædia  mr a f petch in cassier's magazine  cassier's magazine chapter iv portable tools  if the mountain won't come to mahomet says the proverb mahomet must go to the mountain this is as true in the workshop as outside;mahomet being the tool the mountain the work on which it must be used with the increase in size of machinery and engineering material methods half a century old do not in many cases suffice; especially at a time when commercial competition has greatly reduced the margin of profits formerly expected by the manufacturer to take the case of a large shaft which must have a slot cut along it on one side to accommodate the keywedge which holds an eccentric for moving the steam valves of a cylinder or a screwpropeller so that it cannot slip the mass weighs perhaps twenty tons one way of doing the job is to transport the shaft under a drill that will cut a hole at each end of the slot area and then to turn it over to the planer for the intermediate metal to be scraped out this is a very toilsome and expensive business entailing the use of costly machinery which might be doing more useful work and the sacrifice of much valuable time inventors have therefore produced portable tools which can perform work on big bodies just as efficiently as if it had been done by larger machinery in a fraction of the time and at a greatly reduced cost to quote an example the cutting of a keyway of the kind just described by big machines would consume perhaps a whole day whereas the light portable easily attached miller now generally used bites it out in ninety minutes  pneumatic tools the best known of these is the pneumatic hammer it consists of a cylinder inside which moves a solid piston having a stroke of from half an inch to six inches air is supplied through flexible tubing from a compressing pump worked by steam the piston beats on a loose block of metal carried in the end of the tool which does the actual striking the piston suddenly decreases in diameter at about the centre of its length leaving a shoulder on which air can work to effect the withdrawal stroke by a very simple arrangement of airports the piston is made to act as its own valve as the plane side of the piston has a greater area than that into which the pistonrod fits the striking movement is much more violent than the return under a pressure of several hundreds of pounds to the square inch a pneumatic hammer delivers upwards of blows per minute; the quick succession of comparatively gentle taps having the effect of a much smaller number of heavier blows for the flat hammer head can be substituted a curved die for riveting or a chipping chisel or a caulking iron to close the seams of boilers the riveter is peculiarly useful for ship and bridgebuilding work where it is impossible to apply an hydraulic tool a skilled workman will close the rivet heads as fast as his assistant can place them in their holes; certainly in less than half the time needed for swinghammer closing even more effective proportionately is the pneumatic chipper the writer has seen one cut a strip off the edge of a halfinch steel plate at the rate of several inches a minute to the uninitiated beholder it would seem impossible that a tool weighing less than two stone could thus force its way through solid metal the speed of the piston is so high that though it scales but a few pounds its momentum is great enough to advance the chisel a fraction of an inch and the individual advances following one another with inconceivable rapidity soon total up into a big cut automatic chisels are very popular with ornamental masons as they lend themselves to the sculpturing of elaborate designs in stone and marble their principle modified to suit work of another character is seen in percussive rock drills such as the ingersoll sergeant in this case the piston and tool are solid and the air is let into the cylinder by means of slide valves operated by tappets which the piston strikes during its movements some types of the rockdrill are controllable as to the length of their stroke so that it can be shortened while the entry of the hole is being made and gradually increased as the hole deepens for perpendicular boring the drill is mounted on a heavily weighted tripod the inertia of which effectively damps all recoil from the shock of striking; for horizontal work and sometimes for vertical the support is a pillar wedged between the walls of the tunnel or shaft an ingenious detail is the rifled bar which causes the drill to rotate slightly on its axis between every two strokes so that it may not jam the drills are light enough to be easily erected and dismantled and compact so that they can be used in restricted and outofthe way places while their simplicity entails little special training on the part of the workman with pneumatic and other powerdrills the cost of piercing holes for explosive charges is reduced to less than onequarter of that of jumping with a crowbar and sledgehammers with the hand method two men are required usually more; one man to hold guide and turn the drill; and the other or others to strike the blows with hammers the machine striking a blow far more rapidly than can be done by hand reduces the number of operators to one man and perhaps his helper so durable is the metal of these wonderful little mechanisms that the delivery of blows daily for months even though each is given with a force of perhaps half a ton fails to wear them out; or at the most only necessitates the renewal of some minor and cheap part the debt that civilisation owes to the substitution of mechanical for hand labour will be fully understood by anyone who is conversant with the history of tunneldriving and mining another application of pneumatics is seen in the device for cutting off the ends of stay bolts of locomotive boilers it consists of a cylinder about fifteen inches in diameter the piston of which operates a pair of large nippers capable of shearing halfinch bars the whole apparatus weighs but threequarters of a hundredweight yet its power is such that it can trim bolts forty times as fast as a man working with hammer and coldchisel and more thoroughly then there is the machine for breaking the short bolts which hold together the outer and inner shells of the waterjacket round a locomotive furnace a threaded bar along which travels a nut has a hook on its end to catch the bolt the nut is screwed up to make the proper adjustment and a pneumatic cylinder pulls on the hook with a force of many tons easily shearing through the bolt we must not forget the pneumatic borer for cutting holes in wood or metal or enlarging holes already existing the head of the borer contains three little cylinders set at an angle of ° to rotate the drill the valves opening automatically to admit air at very high pressures behind the pistons any carpenter can imagine the advantage of a drill which has merely to be forced against its work the movement of a small lever by the thumb doing the rest! next on the list comes the pneumatic painter which acts on much the same principle as the scentspray mechanical painting first came to the fore in when the huge chicago exposition provided many acres of surfaces which had to be protected from the weather or hidden from sight the following description of one of the machines used to replace handwork is given in cassier's magazine the paint is atomized and sprayed on to the work by a stream of compressed air from a small aircompressor the air is led through flexible hose to a painttank which is provided with an airtight cover and clamping screws the paint is contained in a pot which can be readily removed and replaced by another when a different colour is required this arrangement of interchangeable tins is also important as facilitating easy cleaning the container is furnished with a semirotary stirrer the spindle passing through a stuffingbox in the cover and ending in a handle by which the whole thing complete may be carried about the compressor is necessarily fixed or stationary but the painttank connected to it by the single airhose can be moved close to the work while the length of hose from the tank to the nozzle gives the freedom of movement necessary airpressure is admitted to the tank by a bottom valve and forces the paint up an internal pipe and along a hose from the tank to the spraying nozzle to which airpressure is also led by a second hose the nozzle is practically an injector of special form the flow of paint at the nozzle is controlled by a small plug valve and spring lever on which the operator keeps his thumb while working and which on release closes automatically when it is required to change from one colour to another or to use a different material such as varnish the can previously in use is removed and air or if necessary paraffin oil is blown through the length of hose which supplies the paint until it is completely clean the writer then mentions as an instance of the machine's efficiency that it has covered a feet by feet boiler in less than an hour and that at one large bridge yard a feet by feet girder with all its projecting parts was coated with boiled oil in two hoursa job which would have occupied a man with a brush a whole day to execute apart from saving time the machine produces a surface quite free from brush marks and easily reaches surfaces in intricate mouldings which are difficult to get at with a brush the pneumatic sandjet is used for a variety of purposes for cleaning off old paint or the weathered surface of stonework; for polishing up castings and forgings after they have been brazed at the cycle factory you will find the sandjet hard at work on the joints of cycle frames which must be cleared of all roughness before they are fit for the enameller the writer a few days before penning these lines watched a jet removing london grime from the face of a large hotel down a side street stood a steamengine busily compressing air which was led by long pipes to the jet situated on some lofty scaffolding the rapidity with which the flying grains scoured off smoke deposits attracted the notice of a large crowd which gazed with upturned heads at the whitened stones a peculiarity about the jet is that it proves much more effective on hard material than on soft as the latter by offering an elastic surface robs the sand of its cutting power after merely mentioning the pneumatic rammer for forcing sand into foundry moulds we pass to the pneumatic sandpapering machine which may be described briefly as a revolving disc carrying a circle of sandpaper on its face revolved between guards which keep it flat to its work the disc flies round many hundreds of times per minute rapidly wearing down the fibrous surface of the wood it touches when the coarse paper has done its work a finelygrained cloth is substituted to produce the finish needful for painting chapter v the pedrail a walking steamengine  have you ever watched carefully a steamroller's action on the road when it is working on newly laid stones? if you have you noticed that the stones gravel etc in front of the roller moved with a wavelike motion so that the engine was practically climbing a neverending hill no wonder then that the mechanism of such a machine needs to be very strong and its power multiplied by means of suitable gearing again suppose that an irontyred vehicle travelling at a rapid pace meets a large stone what happens? either the stone is forced into the ground or the wheel must rise over it in either case there will be a jar to the vehicle and a loss of propulsive power do not all cyclists know the fatigue of riding over a bumpy roadfatigue to both muscles and nerves? as regards motors and cycles the vibration trouble has been largely reduced by the employment of pneumatic tyres which lap over small objects and when they strike large ones minimise the shock by their bufferlike nature yet there is still a great loss of power and if pneumatictyred vehicles suffer what must happen to the solid snorting inelastic tractionengine? on hard roads it rattles and bumps along pulverising stones crushing the surface when soft ground is encountered in sink the wheels because their bearing surface must be increased until it is sufficient to carry the engine's weight but by the time that they are six inches below the surface there will be a continuous vertical belt of earth six inches deep to be crushed down incessantly by their advance how much more favourably situated is the railway locomotive or truck their wheels touch metal at a point but a fraction of an inch in length; consequently there is nothing to hamper their progression so great is the difference between the rail and the road that experiment has shown that whereas a pull of from to lbs will move a ton on rails an equal weight requires a tractive force of to lbs on the ordinary turnpike in order to obviate this great wastage of power various attempts have been made to provide a road locomotive with means for laying its own rail track as it proceeds about forty years ago mr boydell constructed a wheel which took its own rail with it the rails being arranged about the wheel like a hexagon round a circle so that as the wheel moved it always rested on one of the hexagon's sides itself flat on the ground this device had two serious drawbacks in the first place the plates made a rattling noise which has been compared to the reports of a maxim gun; secondly though the contrivance acted fairly well on level ground it failed when uneven surfaces were encountered thus if a brick lay across the path one end of a plate rested on the brick the other on the ground behind and the unsupported centre had to carry a sudden severe strain furthermore the plates being connected at the angles of the hexagon could not tilt sideways with the result that breakages were frequent of late years another inventor mr j b diplock has come forward with an invention which bids fair to revolutionise heavy road traffic at present though it has reached a practical stage and undergone many tests satisfactorily it has not been made absolutely perfect for the simple reason that no great invention jumps to finality all at once are not engineers still improving the locomotive? the pedrail as it has been named signifies a rail moving on feet mr diplock observing that a horse has for its weight a tractive force much in excess of the tractionengine took a hint from nature and conceived the idea of copying the horse's foot action the reader must not imagine that here is a return to the abortive and rather ludicrous attempts at a walking locomotive made many years ago when some engineers considered it proper that a railway engine should be propelled by legs mr diplock's device not merely propels but also steps ie selects the spot on the ground which shall be the momentary point at which propulsive force shall be exerted to make this clearer consider the action of a wheel first we will suppose that the spokes any number you please are connected at their outer ends by flat plates as each angle is passed the wheel falls flop on to the next plate the greater the number of the spokes the less will be each successive jar or step; and consequently the perfect wheel is theoretically one in which the sides have been so much multiplied as to be infinitely short a horse has practically two wheels its front legs one its back legs the other the shoulder and hip joints form the axles and the legs the spokes as the animal pulls the leg on the ground advances at the shoulder past the vertical position and the horse would fall forwards were it not for the other leg which has been advanced simultaneously each step corresponds to our manysided wheel falling on to a flat sideand the hammer hammer hammer on the hard high road is the horsey counterpart of the metallic rattle on rough ground a horse has a great advantage over a wheeled tractor because it can put its feet down on the top of objects of different elevations and still pull a wheel cannot do this and as we have seen a loss of power results our inventor therefore created in his pedrail a compromise between the railway smoothness and ease of running and the selective and accommodating powers of a quadruped we must now plunge into the mechanical details of the pedrail which is strictly speaking a term confined to the wheel alone our illustration will aid the reader to follow the working of the various parts in a railway we have a sleepers on the ground b rails attached to the sleepers c wheels rolling over the rails in the pedrail the order reckoning upwards is altered on the ground is the ped or movable sleeper carrying wheels over which a rail attached to the moving vehicle glides continuously the principle is used by anyone who puts wooden rollers down to help him move heavy furniture about of course the peds cannot be put on the ground and left behind; they must accompany their rollers and rails we will endeavour to explain in simple words how this is effected to the axles of the locomotive is attached firmly a flat vertical plate parallel to the sides of the firebox pivoted to it top and bottom at their centres are two horizontal rocking arms; and these have their extremities connected by two bowshaped bars or cams their convex edges pointing outwards away from the axle powerful springs also join the rocking arms and tend to keep them in a horizontal position thus we have a powerful frame which can oscillate up and down at either end the bottom arm is the rail on which the whole weight of the axle rests the rotating and moving parts consist of a large flat circular case the sides of which are a few inches apart its circumference is pierced by fourteen openings provided with guides to accommodate as many short sliding spokes which are in no way attached to the main axle each spoke is shaped somewhat like a tuningfork in the v is a rollerwheel and at the tip is a ped or foot as the case revolves the tuningfork spokes pass as it were with a leg on each side of the framework referred to above; the wheel of each spoke being the only part which comes into contact with the frame strong springs hold the spokes and rollers normally at an equal distance from the wheel's centre it must now be stated that the object of the framework is to thrust the rollers outwards as they approach the ground and slide them below the rail the sidepieces of the frame are as will be noticed see fig eccentric ie points on their surfaces are at different distances from the axle centre this is to meet the fact that the distance from the axle to the ground is greater in an oblique direction than it is vertically and therefore for three spokes to be carrying the weight at once two of them must be more extended than the third so then a spoke is moved outward by the frame till its roller gets under the rail and as it passes off it it gradually slides inwards again it will be obvious to the reader that if the peds were attached inflexibly to the ends of their spokes they would strike the ground at an angle and of course be badly strained now mr diplock meant his peds to be as like feet as possible and come down flat he therefore furnished them with ankles that is ballandsocket joints so that they could move loosely on their spokes in all directions; and as such a contrivance must be protected from dust and dirt the inventor produced what has been called a crustacean joint on account of the resemblance it bears to the overlapping armourplates of a lobster's tail the plates which suggest very thin quoits are made of copper and can be renewed at small cost when badly worn an elastic spring collar at the top takes up all wear automatically and renders the plates noiseless this detail cost its inventor much work the first joint made represented an expenditure of £; but now thanks to automatic machinery any number can be turned out at s d each a word about the feet a wheel has fourteen of these they are eleven inches in diameter at the tread and soled with rubber in eight segments with strips of wood between the segments to prevent suction in clay soil the segments are held together by a malleable castiron ring around the periphery of the feet and a tightening core in the centre these wearing parts being separate from the rest of the foot are easily and cheaply renewed and repairs can be quickly effected if necessary when on the road the surface in contact with the ground being composed of the three substancesmetal wood and rubber which all take a bearing provides a combination of materials adapted to the best adhesion and wear on any class of road or even on no road at all illustration fig  motive power is transmitted by the machinery to the wheel axle from that to the casing from the casing to the sliding spokes as there are alternately two and three feet simultaneously in contact with the ground the power of adhesion is very greatmuch greater than that of an ordinary tractionengine this is what professor heleshaw says in a report on a pedrail tractor the weight of the engine is spread over no less than twelve feet each one of which presses upon the ground with an area immensely greaterprobably as much as ten times greaterthan that of all the wheels of an ordinary tractionengine taken together on a hard road upon a soft road all comparison between wheels and the action of these feet ceases the contact of each of the feet of the pedrail is absolutely free from all slipping action and attains the absolute ideal of working being merely placed in position without sliding to take up the load and then lifted up again without any sliding to be carried to a new position on the road it is necessary that the feet should come down flat on the ground if they struck it at all edgeways they would sprain their ankles; otherwise probably break off at the ball joint mechanism was therefore introduced by which the feet would be turned over as they approached the ground and be held at the proper angle ready for the step without the aid of a special diagram it would be difficult to explain in detail how this is managed; and it must suffice to say that the chief feature is a frictionclutch worked by the roller of the foot's spoke to the onlooker the manner in which the pedrail crawls over obstacles is almost weird the writer was shown a small working model of a pedrail propelled along a board covered with bits of cork wood etc the axle of the wheel scarcely moved upwards at all and had he not actually seen the obstacles he would have been inclined to doubt their existence an ordinary wheel of equal diameter took the obstructions with a series of bumps and bounds that made the contrast very striking illustration fig  an extreme instance of the pedrail's capacity would be afforded by the ascent of a flight of steps see fig in such a case the three peds carrying the weight of an axle would not be on the same level that makes no difference because the frame merely tilts on its top and bottom pivots the front of the rail rising to a higher level than the back end and the back spokes being projected by the rail much further than those in front so that the engine is simply levered over its rollers up an inclined plane similarly in descending the front spokes are thrust out the furthest and the reverse action takes place with so many moving parts everything must be well lubricated or the wear would soon become serious the feet are kept properly greased by being filled with a mixture of blacklead and grease of suitable quality which requires renewal at long intervals only the sliding spokes rollers and frictionclutches are all lubricated from one central oilchamber through a beautiful system of oiltubes which provides a circulation of the oil throughout all the moving parts the central oilchamber is filled from one orifice and holds a sufficient supply of oil for a long journey we may now turn for a moment from the pedrail itself to the vehicles to which it is attached here again we are met by novelties for in his engines mr diplock has so arranged matters that not only can both front and back pairs of wheels be used as drivers but both also take part in the steering as may be imagined many difficulties had to be surmounted before this innovation was complete but that it was worth while is evident from the small space in which a doublesteering tractor can turn thanks to both its axles being movable and from the increased power another important feature must also be noticed viz that the axles can both tip vertically so that when the front left wheel is higher than its fellow the left back wheel may be lower than the right back wheel in short flexibility and power are the ideals which mr diplock has striven to reach how far he has been successful may be gathered from the reports of experts professor heleshaw frs says the pedrail constitutes in my belief the successful solution of a walking machine which whilst obviating the chief objections to the ordinary wheel running upon the road can be made to travel anywhere where an ordinary wheel can go and in many places where it cannot at the same time it has the mechanical advantages which have made the railway system such a phenomenal success it constitutes in my belief the solution of one of the most difficult mechanical problems and deserves to be considered as an invention quite apart from any particular means by which it is actuated whether it is placed upon a selfpropelled carriage or a vehicle drawn by any agency mechanical or otherwise the way in which all four wheels are driven simultaneously so as to give the maximum pulling effect by means of elastic connection is in itself sufficient to mark the engine as a most valuable departure from common practice hitherto this driving of four wheels has never been successfully achieved partly because of the difficulty of turning the steeringwheels and partly because until the present invention of mr diplock the front and hind wheels would act against each other a defect at first experienced and overcome by the inventor in his first engine illustration a pedrail tractor engaged in war office trials the inventor mr j b diplock is standing on the left of the group observe the manner in which the feet gradually assume a horizontal position as they approach the ground on january th mr diplock tried an engine fitted with two ordinary wheels behind and two pedrails in front the authority quoted above was present at the trials and his opinion will therefore be interesting the points which struck me immediately were the marvellous ease with which it started into action the little noise with which it worked another thing which i noticed was the difference in the behaviour of the feet and wheels the feet did not in any way seem to affect the surface of the road throwing down large stones the size of the fist into their path the feet simply set themselves to an angle in passing over the stones and did not crush them; whereas the wheel coming after invariably crushed the stones and moreover distorted the road surface coming to the top of the hill i made the pedrail walk first over inch planks then inch and finally over a inch balk one could scarcely believe on witnessing these experiments that the whole structure was not permanently distorted and strained whereas it was evidently within the limits of play allowed by the mechanism as a proof of this the diplock engine walked down to the works and i then witnessed its ascent of a lane beside the engineering works which had ruts eight or ten inches deep and was a steep slope this lane was composed in places of the softest mud and whereas the wheels squeezed out the ground in all directions the feet of the pedrails set themselves at the angles of the rut where it was hard or walked through the soft and yielding mud without making the slightest disturbance of the surrounding ground i came away from that trial with the firm conviction that i had seen what i believe to be the dawn of a new era in mechanical transport mr diplock does not regard the pedrail as an end in itself so much as a means to an end viz the development of roadborne traffic for very long distances which must be covered in a minimum of time the railway will hold its own but there is a growing feeling that unless the railways can be fed by subsidiary methods of transport more effectively than at present and unless remote country districts whither it would not pay to carry even a light railway are brought into closer touch with the busier parts our communications cannot be considered satisfactory and we are not getting the best value out of our roads for many classes of goods cheapness of transportation is of more importance than speed; witness the fact that coal is so often sent by canal rather than by rail here then is the chance for the pedrail tractor and its long train of vehicles fitted with pedrail wheels which will tend to improve the road surfaces they travel over mr diplock sets out in his interesting book a new system of heavy goods transport on common roads a scheme for collecting goods from branch routes on to main routes where a number of cars will be coupled up and towed by powerful tractors with ordinary fourwheeled trucks it is difficult to take a number round a sharp corner since each truck describes a more sudden circle than its predecessor the last often endeavouring to climb the pavement fourwheeled would therefore be replaced by twowheeled trucks provided with special couplings to prevent the cars tilting while allowing them to turn cars so connected would follow the same track round a curve the body of the car would be removable and of a standard size it could be attached to a simple horse frame for transport into the fields there the farmer would load his produce and when the body was full it would be returned to the road picked up by a crane attached to the tractor swung on to its carriage and wheels and taken away to join other cars by making the bodies of such dimensions as to fit three into an ordinary railway truck they could be entrained easily on reaching their destination another tractor would lift them out fit them to wheels and trundle them off to the consumer by this method there would be no breaking bulk of goods required from the time it was first loaded till it was exposed in the market for sale these things are of course in the future of more present importance is the fact that the war office has from the first taken great interest in the new invention which promises to be of value for military transport over ground either rough or boggy trials have been made by the authorities with encouraging results that daring writer mr h g wells has in his land ironclads pictured the pedrail taking an offensive part in warfare huge steelplated forts mounted on pedrails and full of heavy artillery and machine guns sweep slowly across the country towards where the enemy has entrenched himself the forts are impervious alike to shell and bullet but as they cross ditch or hillock in their gigantic stride their artillery works havoc among their opponents who are finally forced to an unconditional surrender even if the pedrail is not made to carry weapons of destruction we can after our experiences with horseflesh in the boer war understand how important it may become for commissariat purposes the feats which it has already performed mark it as just the locomotive to tackle the rough country in which baggage trains often find themselves to conclude with a more peaceful use for it when fresh country is opened up years must often pass before a proper high road can be made yet there is great need of an organised system of transport whither ordinary tractionengines or carts even horses could scarcely penetrate the pedrail tractor thanks to its big flat feet which give it as someone has remarked the appearance of a cross between a tractionengine and an elephant will be able to push its way at the forefront of advancing civilisation at home we shall have good reason to welcome the pedrail if it frees us from those terrible corrugated tracks so dreaded by the cyclist and to bless it if it actually beats our roads down into a greater smoothness than they now can boast chapter vi internal combustion engines oil enginesengines worked with producer gasblast furnace gas engines  if carbon and oxygen be made to combine chemically the process is accompanied by the phenomenon called heat if heat be applied to a liquid or gas in a confined space it causes a violent separation of its molecules and power is developed in the case of a steamengine the fuel is coal carbon in a more or less pure form the fluid water by burning the fuel under a boiler a gas is formed which if confined rapidly increases the pressure on the walls of the confining vessel if allowed to pass into a cylinder the molecules of steam struggling to get as far as possible from one another will do useful work on a piston connected by rods to a revolving crank we here see the combustion of fuel external to the cylinder ie under the boiler and the fuel and fluid kept apart out of actual contact in the gas or oilvapour engine the fuel is brought into contact with the fluid which does the work mixed with it and burnt inside the cylinder therefore these engines are termed internal combustion engines supposing that a little gunpowder were placed in a cylinder of which the piston had been pushed almost as far in as it would go and that the powder were fired by electricity the charcoal would unite with the oxygen contained in the saltpetre and form a large volume of gas this gas being heated by the ignition would instantaneously expand and drive out the piston violently a very similar thing happens at each explosion of an internal combustion engine into the cylinder is drawn a charge of gas containing carbon oxygen and hydrogen and also a proportion of air this charge is squeezed by the inward movement of the piston; its temperature is raised by the compression and at the proper moment it is ignited the oxygen and carbon seize on one another and burn or combine the heat being increased by the combustion of the hydrogen the air atoms are expanded by the heat and work is done on the piston but the explosion is much gentler than in the case of gunpowder during recent years the internal combustion engine has been making rapid progress ousting steam power from many positions in which it once reigned supreme we see it propelling vehicles along roads and rails driving boats through the water and doing duty in generating stations and smelting works to turn dynamos or drive airpumpsnot to mention the thousand other forms of usefulness which were they enumerated here would fill several pages a decade ago an internal combustion engine of hp was a wonder; today single engines are built to develop hp and in a few years even this enormous capacity will doubtless be increased it is interesting to note that the rival systemsgas and steamwere being experimented with at the same time by robert street and james watt respectively while watt applied his genius to the useful development of the power latent in boiling water street in took out letters patent for an engine to be worked by the explosions caused by vaporising spirits of turpentine on a hot metal surface mixing the vapour with air in a cylinder exploding the mixture and using the explosion to move a piston in his and subsequent designs the mixture was pumped in from a separate cylinder under slight pressure lenoir in conceived the idea of making the piston suck in the charge so abolishing the need of a separate pump; and many engines built under his patents were long in use though if judged by modern standards they were very wasteful of fuel two years later alphonse beau de rochas proposed the further improvement of utilising the cylinder not only as a suction pump but also as a compressor; since he saw that a compressed mixture would ignite very much more readily than one not under pressure rochas held the secret of success in his grasp but failed to turn it to practical account the otto cycle invented by dr otto in is really only rochas's suggestion materialised the large majority of internal combustion engines employ this cycle of operations so we may state its exact meaning  a mixture of explosive gas and air is drawn into the cylinder by the piston as it passes outwards ie in the direction of the crank through the inlet valve  the valve closes and the returning piston compresses the mixture  the mixture is fired as the piston commences its second journey outwards and gives the power stroke  the piston returning again ejects the exploded mixture through the outlet or exhaust valve which began to open towards the end of the third stroke briefly stated the cycle issuction compression explosion expulsion; one impulse being given during each cycle which occupies two complete revolutions of the flywheel since the first second and third operations all absorb energy the wheel must be heavy enough to store sufficient momentum during the power stroke to carry the piston through all its three other duties year by year the compression of the mixture has been increased and improvements have been made in the methods of governing the speed of the engine so that it may be suitable for work in which the load is constantly varying by doubling trebling and quadrupling the cylinders the drive is rendered more and more steady and the elasticity of a steamengine more nearly approached the internal combustion engine has arrived so late because in the earlier part of last century conditions were not favourable to its development illuminating gas had not come into general use and such coal gas as was made was expensive the great oilfields of america and russia had not been discovered but while the proper fuels for this type of motor were absent coal the food of the steamengine lay ready to hand and in forms which though useless for many purposes could be advantageously burnt under a boiler now the situation has altered gas is abundant; and oil of the right sort costs only a few pence a gallon inventors and manufacturers have grasped the opportunity today over hp is developed continuously by the internal combustion engine steam would not have met so formidable a rival had not that rival had some great advantages to offer what are these? well first enter a factory driven by steam power and carefully note what you see then visit a large gas or oilengine plant you will conclude that the latter scores on many points there are no stokers required no boilers threaten possible explosions the heat is less the dust and dirt are less the space occupied by the engines is less there is no noisome smoke to be led away through tall and expensive chimneys if work is stopped for an hour or a day there are no fires to be banked or drawninvolving waste in either case above all the gas engine is more efficient or if you like to express the same thing in other words more economical if you use only one horsepower for one hour a day it doesn't much matter whether that horsepowerhour costs d or d but in a factory where a thousand horsepower is required all day long the extra pence make a big total if therefore the proprietor finds that a shilling'sworth of gas or oil does a quarter as much work again as a shilling'sworth of coal and that either form of fuel is easily obtained you may be sure that so far as economy is concerned he will make up his mind without difficulty as to the class of engine to be employed a pound of coal burnt under the best type of steamengine gives but per cent of its heating value in useful work a good oilengine gives per cent and in special types the figures are said to rise to per cent we may notice another point viz that while a steamengine must be kept as hot as possible to be efficient an internal combustion engine must be cooled in the former case no advantage beyond increased efficiency results but in the latter the water passed round the cylinders to take up the surplus heat has a value for warming the building or for manufacturing processes putting one thing with another experts agree that the explosion engine is the prime mover of the future steam has apparently been developed almost to its limit its rival is but halfgrown though already a giant some internal combustion engines use petroleum as their fuel converting it into gas before it is mixed with air to form the charge; others use coalgas drawn from the lighting mains; poor gas made in special plants for power purposes; or natural gas issuing from the ground natural gas occurs in very large quantities in the united states where it is conveyed through pipes under pressure for hundreds of miles and distributed among factories and houses for driving machinery heating and cooking in england and europe the petroleum engine and coalgas engine have been most utilised; but of late the employment of smeltingfurnace gasesformerly blown into the air and wastedand of producer gas has come into great favour with manufacturers the latest development is the suction gas engine which makes its own gas by drawing steam and air through glowing fuel during the suction stroke we will consider the various types under separate headings devoted  to the oilfuel engine  the producergas engine and the suctiongas engine  blastfurnace gas engines with reference to the installations used in connection with the last two all explosion engines excepting the very small types employed on motor cycles have a waterjacket round the cylinders to absorb some of the heat of combustion which would otherwise render the metal so hot as to make proper lubrication impossible and also would unduly expand the incoming charge of gas and air before compression the ideal engine would take in a full charge of cold mixture which would receive no heat from the walls of the cylinder and during the explosion would pass no heat through the walls in other words the ideal metal for the cylinders would be one absolutely nonreceptive of heat in the absence of this engineers are obliged to make a compromise and to keep the cylinder at such a temperature that it can be lubricated fittingly while not becoming so cold as to absorb too much of the heat of explosion  oil engines these fall into two main classes a those using light volatile mineral oilssuch as petrol and benzolineand alcohol a vegetable product b those using heavy oils such as paraffin oil kerosene and the denser constituents of rockoil left in the stills after the kerosene has been driven off american petroleum is rich in burningoil and petrol; russian in the very heavy residue called astakti given the proper apparatus for vaporisation mineral oils of any density can be used in the explosion engine the first class is so well known as the mover of motor vehicles and boats that we need not linger here on it it may however be remarked that engines using the easilyvaporised oils are not of large powers since the fuel is too expensive to make them valuable for installations where large units of power are needed they have been adopted for locomotives on account of their lightness and the ease with which they can be started petrol vaporises at ordinary temperatures so that air merely passed over the spirit absorbs sufficient vapour to form an explosive mixture the jet carburetter now generally employed makes the mixture more positive by atomising the spirit as it passes through a very fine nozzle into the mixing chamber under the suction from the cylinder on account of their small size spirit engines work at very high speeds as compared with the large oil or gas engine thus while a hp körting gas engine develops full power at eightyfive revolutions a minute the tiny cycle motor must be driven at to revolutions speaking generally as the size increases the speed decreases of heavy oil engines there are some dozens of welltried types they differ in their methods of effecting the following operations the feeding of the oil fuel to the engine  the conversion of the oil into vapour  the ignition of the charge  the governing of speed all these engines have a vaporiser or chamber wherein the oil is converted into gas by the action of heat when startingup the engine this chamber must be heated by a specially designed lamp similar in principle to that used by house painters for burning old paint off wood or metal let us now consider the operations enumerated above in some detail  the oil supply fuel is transferred from the storage tank to the vaporiser either by the action of gravity through a regulating device to prevent flooding or by means of a small pump or by the suction of the piston which lifts the liquid in some engines the air and gas enter the cylinder through a single valve; in others through separate valves  vaporisation as already remarked the vaporising chamber must be heated to start the engine when work has begun the lamp may be removed if the engine is so designed that the chamber stores up sufficient heat in its walls from each explosion to vaporise the charge for the next power stroke the crossley engine has a lamp continuously burning; the hornsbyackroyd depends upon the storage of heat from explosions in a chamber opening into the cylinder the best designs are fairly equally divided between the two systems  ignition of the compressed charge is effected in one of four ways by bringing the charge at the end of the compression stroke into contact with a closed tube projecting from the cylinder and heated outside by a continuously burning lamp; by the heat stored in some part of the combustion chamber ie that portion of the cylinder not swept by the piston; by an electric spark; or by the mere heat of compression the second and third methods are confined to comparatively few makes; and the diesel oil engine of which more presently has a monopoly of the fourth  governing all engines which turn machinery doing intermittent worksuch as that of a sawmill or electric generating plant connected with a number of motorsmust be very carefully guarded from overrunning imagine the effect on an engine which is putting out its whole strength and getting full charges of fuel if the belt suddenly slipped off and it were allowed its head a burst flywheel would be only one of the results the steamengine is easily controlled by the centrifugal action of a ballgovernor which as the speed increases gradually spreads its balls and lifts a lever connected with a valve in the steam supply pipe owing to its elastic nature steam will do useful work if admitted in small quantities to the cylinder but a difficulty arises with the internal combustion engine if the supply of mixture is similarly throttled because a loss of quantity means loss of compression and bad ignition many oil engines are therefore governed by apparatus which when the speed exceeds a certain limit cuts off the supply altogether either by throwing the oilpump temporarily out of action or by lifting the exhaust valve so that the movement of the piston causes no suctionthe hitandmiss method as it is called the means adopted depends on the design of the engine; and it must be said that though all the devices commonly used effect their purpose none are perfect; this being due rather to the nature of an internal explosion engine than to any lack of ingenuity on the part of inventors the steadiest running is probably given with the throttle control which diminishes the supply on motor cars this method has practically ousted the hitandmiss governed exhaust valve; but in stationary engines we more commonly find the speed controlled by robbing the mixture of the explosive gas in inverse proportion to the amount of the work required from the engine  the diesel oil engine on account of some features peculiar to it is treated separately in an expert wrote of it that the engine has not attained any commercial position herr rudolph diesel the inventor has however won a high place for his primemover among those which consume liquid fuel on account of its extraordinary economy the makers claimas the result of many teststhat with the crude rockoil costing in bulk about d a gallon which it uses a horsepower can be developed for one hour by this engine for onetenth of a penny the daily fuel bill for a hp engine running ten hours per day would therefore be s d to compete with the diesel engine a steam installation would have to be of the very highest class of tripleexpansion type of not less than hp and using every hour per horsepower only lbs of coal at s per ton very few large steamengines work under conditions so favourable and with small sizes lbs of coal would be burnt for every horsepowerhour the diesel differs from other internal combustion engines in the following respects it works with very much higher compression  the ignition is spontaneous resulting from the high  compression of the charge alone  the fuel is not admitted into the cylinder until the  powerstroke begins and enters in the form of a  fine spray  the combustion of the fuel is much slower and therefore  gives a more continuous and elastic push to the  piston the engine works on the ordinary otto cycle to start it air compressed in a separate vessel is injected into the cylinder the piston flies out and on its return squeezes the air to about lbs to the square inch thus rendering it incandescent just as the piston begins to move out again a valve in the cylinderhead opens and a jet of pulverised oil is squirted in by air compressed to lbs per square inch more than the pressure in the cylinder the vapour meeting the hot air burns but comparatively slowly the pressure in the cylinder during the stroke decreasing much more gradually than in other engines governing is effected by regulation of the amount of oil admitted into the cylinder in spite of its high compression this engine runs with very little vibration the writer saw a penny stand unmoved on its edge on the top of a cylinder in which the piston was reciprocating times a minute!  engines worked by producergas these engines are worked by a special gas generated in an apparatus called a producer if air is forced through incandescent carbon in a closed furnace its oxygen unites with the carbon and forms carbonic acid gas known chemically as co because every molecule of the gas contains one atom of carbon and two of oxygen this gas being the product of combustion cannot burn ie combine with more oxygen but as it passes up through the glowing coke coal or other fuel it absorbs another carbon atom into every molecule and we have co or co which we know as carbon monoxide this gas may be seen burning on the top of an open fire with a very pale blue flame as it once more combines with oxygen to form carbonic acid gas the carbon monoxide is valuable as a heating agent and when mixed with air forms an explosive mixture if along with the air sent into our furnace there goes a proportion of steam further chemical action results the oxygen of the steam combines with carbon to form carbon monoxide and sets free the hydrogen the latter gas when it combines with oxygen in combustion causes intense heat; so that if from the furnace we can draw off carbon monoxide and hydrogen we shall be able to get a mixture which during combustion will set up great heat in the cylinder of an engine in mr emerson dowson invented an apparatus for manufacturing a gas suitable for power plant the gas being known as producer or poor gas the last term referring to its poorness in hydrogen as compared with coal and other gases while the hydrogen is a desirable ingredient in an explosive charge it must not form a large proportion since under compression it renders the mixture in which it takes part dangerously combustible and liable to spontaneous ignition before the piston has finished the compression stroke watergas very rich in hydrogen and made by a very similar process is therefore not suitable for internal combustion engines there are many types of producers but they fall under two main heads ie the pressure and the suction the pressure producer contains the following essential parts the generator a vertical furnace fed from the top through an airtight trap and shut off below from the outside atmosphere by having its foot immersed in water any fuel or ashes which fall through the bars into the water can be abstracted without spoiling the draught air and steam are forced into the generator and pass up through the fuel with the chemical results already described the gases then flow into a cooler enclosed in a waterjacket through which water circulates and on into a scrubber where they must find their way upwards through coke kept dripping with water from overhead jets the water collects impurities of all sorts and the gas is then ready for storage in the gasholders or for immediate use in the engines a pound of anthracite coal thus burnt will yield enough gas to develop hp for one hour suction gas plantswith these gas is not stored in larger quantities than are needed for the immediate work of the engine in fact the engine itself during its suction strokes draws air and steam through a very small furnace coolers and scrubbers direct into the cylinder the furnace is therefore fed with air and water not by pressure from outside but by suction from inside hence the name suction producer at the present time suction gas engines are being built for use on ships since a pound of fuel thus consumed will drive a vessel further than if burnt under a steam boiler very possibly the big ocean liners of twenty years hence may be fitted with such engines in the place of the triple and quadruple expansion steam machinery now doing the work  blastfurnace gas engines every iron blastfurnace is very similar in construction and action to the generator of a producergas plant into it are fed through a hopper situated in the top layers of ore coal or coke and limestone at the bottom enters a blast of air heated by passing through a stove of firebrick raised to a high temperature by the carbon monoxide gas coming off from the furnace when the stove has been well heated the gas supply is shut off from it and switched to the enginehouse to create power for driving the huge blowers the gas contains practically no hydrogen as the air sent through the furnace is dry; but since it will stand high compression it is very suitable for use in large engines formerly all the gas from the furnace was expelled into the open air and absolutely wasted; then it was utilised to heat the forced draught to the furnace; next to burn under boilers; and last of all at the suggestion of mr b h thwaite to operate internal combustion engines for blowing purposes thus in the fitness of things we now see the biggest gas engines in the world installed where gas is created in the largest quantities and an interesting cycle of actions results the engine pumps the air; the air blows the furnace and melts the iron out of the ore; the furnace creates the gas; the gas heats the air or works the engines to pump more air so engines and furnace mutually help each other instead of all the obligation being on the one side when a few years ago the method was first introduced engines were damaged by the presence of dust carried with the gas from the furnace mr b h thwaite has however perfected means for the separation of injurious matter and blastfurnace gas is coming into general use in england and on the continent some idea of the power which has been going to waste in ironworks for decades past may be gathered from a report of professor hubert after experiments made in he says that engines of large size do not use more than cubic feet of average blastfurnace gas per effective horsepowerhour which is less than onefourth of the consumption of gas required to develop the same power from boilers and good modern condensing steamengines so that there is an immense surplus of power to be obtained from a blastfurnace if the blowing engines are worked by the gas it generates a surplus which can be still further increased if the gas is properly cleaned it is estimated that for every tons of coke used in an ordinary cleveland blastfurnace after making ample allowance for gas for the stoves and power for the lifts pumps etc and for gas for working the necessary blowing engines there is a surplus of at least hp; so that by economising gas by cleaning and developing the necessary power by gas engines every furnace owner would have a very large surplus of power for his steel or other works or for selling in the form of electricity or otherwise yet all this gas had been formerly turned loose for the breezes to warm their fingers at! truly as an observant writer has recorded the sight of a special plant being put up near a blast furnace to manufacture gas for the blowing engines suggests the pumping of water uphill in order to get waterpower! messrs westgarth and richardson of middlesbrough; the john cockerill company of seraing belgium; and the de la vergne company of new york are among the chief makers of the largest gas engines in the world ranging up to hp each these immense machines some with flywheels feet in diameter and cylinders spacious enough for a man to stand erect in work blowers for furnaces or drive dynamos at the works of the manufacturers mentioned the engines helped to make the steel and turn the machinery for the creation of brother monsters illustration gigantic gas engines five of sixteen hp körting gas engines built by the de la vergne company of new york city for blowing the blast furnaces of the lackawanna steel company the gasengine plant at these works is the largest in the world notice the man to the left this use of a byeproduct of industry is remarkable but it can be paralleled furnace slag once cast away as useless is now recognised to be a valuable manure or is converted into bricks tiles cement and other building materials again the former waste from the coalgas purifier assumes importance as the origin of aniline dyes creosote saccharine ammonia and oils we really appear to be within sight of the happy time when waste will be unknown and it therefore is curious that we still burn gas as an illuminant when the same if made to work an engine would give more lighting power in the shape of electric current supplying incandescent lamps footnote  the fact that air is heated to combustion point by compression has long been known to the chinese in the river of golden sand captain gill writes the natives have an apparatus by which they strike a light by compressed air the apparatus consists of a wooden cylinder inches long by inch in diameter this is closed at one end; the bore being about the size of a stout quill pen an airtight piston fits into this with a large flat knob at the top the other end of the piston is slightly hollowed out and a very small piece of tinder is placed on the top thus formed the cylinder is held in one hand the piston inserted and pushed about halfway down; a very sharp blow is then delivered with the palm of the hand on to the top of the knob; the hand must at the same time close on the knob and instantly withdraw the piston when the tinder will be found alight the compression of the air produces heat enough to light the tinder; but this will go out again unless the piston is withdrawn very sharply i tried a great many times but covered myself with confusion in fruitless efforts to get a light for the natives never miss it chapter vii motorcars the motor omnibusrailway motorcars  the development of the motorcar has been phenomenal early in the only mechanically moved vehicles to be seen on our roads were the tractionengine preceded by a man bearing a red flag the steamroller and in the towns a few trams today the motor is apparent everywhere dodging through street traffic or raising the dust of the country roads and lanes or lumbering along with its load of merchandise at a steady gait as a purely speed machine the motorcar has practically reached its limit with hp or more crowded into a vehicle scaling only a ton the record rate of travel has approached two miles in a minute on specially prepared and peculiarly suitable tracks even up steep hills such a monster will career at nearly eighty miles an hour next to the racing car comes the touring car engined to give sixty miles an hour on the level in the more powerful types or a much lower speed in the car intended for quieter travel and for people who are not prepared to face a big bill for upkeep the luxury of the age has invaded the design of automobiles till the gorgeously decorated and comfortably furnished pullman of the railway has found a counterpart in the motor caravan with its accommodation for sleeping and feeding while the town dweller rolls along in electric landaulet screened from wind and weather the tourist may explore the roads of the world well housed and lolling at ease behind the windows of his guinea machine on which the engineer and carriage builder have lavished their utmost skill the taunt of unreliability once levelledand with justiceat the motorcar is fast losing its force owing to the vast improvements in design and details which manufacturers have been stimulated to make the motorcar industry has a great future before it and the prizes therein are such as to tempt both inventor and engineer every week scores of patents are granted for devices which aim at the perfection of some part of a car its tyres its wheels or its engines until standard types for all grades of motor vehicles have been established this restless flow of ideas will continue its volume is the most striking proof of the vitality of the industry the uses to which the motor vehicle has been put are legion on railways the motor carriage is catering for local traffic on the roads the motor omnibus is steadily increasing its numbers tradesmen of all sorts and persons concerned with the distribution of commodities find that the petrol or steammoved car or lorry has very decided advantages over horse traction our postal authorities have adopted the motor mail van the war office looks to the motor to solve some of its transportation difficulties in short the motor age has arrived which will relatively to the railway age play much the same part as that epoch did to the horse age at the ultimate effects of the change we can only guess; but we see already in the great acceleration of travel wherever the motor is employed that many social institutions are about to be revolutionised but for the determined opposition in the 'thirties of last century to the steam omnibus we should doubtless live today in a very different manner our population would be scattered more broadcast over the country instead of being herded in huge towns many railways would have remained unbuilt but our roads would be kept in much better condition special tracks having been built for the rapid travel of the motor we have only to look to a country now in course of development to see that the road which leads everywhere will in combination with the motor vehicle eventually supplant or at any rate render unnecessary the costly network of railways which must be a network of very fine mesh to meet the needs of a civilised community in the scope of a few pages it is impossible to cover even a tithe of the field occupied by the ubiquitous motorcar and we must therefore restrict ourselves to a glance at the manufacture of its mechanism and a few short excursions into those developments which promise most to alter our modes of life we will begin with a trip over one of the largest motor factories in the world selecting that of messrs dion and bouton whose names are inseparable from the history of the modern motorcar they may justly claim that to deal with the origin rise and progress of the huge business which they have built up would be to give an account in its general lines of all the phases through which the motor especially the petrol motor has passed from its crudest shape to its present state of comparative perfection the count albert de dion was in his earlier days little concerned with things mechanical he turned rather to the fashionable pursuit of duelling in which he seems to have made a name but he was not the man to waste his life in such inanities and when one day he was walking down the paris boulevards his attention was riveted by a little clockwork carriage exposed for sale among other new year's gifts that moment was fraught with great consequences for an inventive mind had found a proper scope for its energy why thought he could not real cars be made to run by some better form of motive power? on inquiring he learnt that a workman named bouton had produced the car the count therefore sought the artisan; with whom he worked out the problem which had now become his aim in life hence it is that the names dionbouton are found on thousands of engines all over the world the partners scored their first successes with steam and petroldriven tricycles built in a small workshop in the avenue malakoff in paris the works were then transferred to puteaux which has since developed into the great automobile centre of the world and after two more changes found a restingplace on the quai national here close upon hands are engaged in supplying the world's requirements in motors and cars let us enter the huge block of buildings and watch them at work the drawingoffice is the brain of the factory within its walls new ideas are being put into practical shape by skilled draughtsmen the drawings are sent to the modelmaking shop where the parts are first fashioned in wood the shop contains dozens of big benches circular saws and planing machines one of them in the form of a revolving drum carrying a number of planes which turns thousands of times a minute and shapes off the rough surface of the blocks of hard wood as if it were so much clay these blocks are cut planed and turned and then put into the hands of a remarkably skilled class of workmen who with rule calliper and chisel shape out cylinders and other parts to the drawings before them with wonderful patience and exactness after the model has been fashioned the next step is to make a clay mould from the same with a hole in the top through which the molten metal is poured the foundry is most picturesque in a lurid rembrandtesque fashion it is black everywhere the floor walls and roof are black and the foundry hands look like unwashed penitents in sackcloth and ashes at the end of the building there is a raised brickwork and when the visitor is able to see in the darkness he distinguishes a number of raised lids along the top while here and there are strewn about huge iron ladles like buckets on the foreman giving the word a man steps up on the brickwork and removes the lid when a column of intense white light strikes upwards it gives one the impression of coming from the bowels of the earth like a hole opening out in a volcano the man bestrides the aperture down which he drops the ladle at the end of a long pole and then pulling it up again full of a strawcoloured shining liquid so close to him that we shudder at the idea of its spilling over his legs and feet he pours the molten metal into a big ladle which is seized by two men who pour the liquid into the moulds the work is more difficult than it looks for it requires a lot of practice to fill the moulds in such a way as to avoid blowholes and flaws that prove such a serious item in foundry practice in the casehardening department next door there are six huge ovens with sliding fronts therein are set parts which have been forged or machined and are subjected to a high temperature while covered in charcoal so that the skin of the metal may absorb carbon at high temperatures and become extremely tough all shafts gears and other moving parts of a car are subjected to this treatment which permits a considerable reduction in the weight of metal used and greatly increases its resistance to wear after being carbonised the material is tempered by immersion in water while of a certain heat judged by the colour of the hot metal we now pass to the turningshop where the cylinders are bored out by a grinding disc rapidly rotating on an eccentric shaft which is gradually advanced through the cylinder as it revolves the utmost accuracy to the part of an inch is necessary in this operation since the bore must be perfectly cylindrical and also of a standard size so that any standard piston may exactly fit it after being bored or rather ground the walls of the cylinder are highly polished and the article is ready for testing the workman entrusted with this task hermetically closes the ends by inserting the cylinder between the plates of an hydraulic press and pumps in water to a required pressure if there be the slightest crack crevice or hole the water finds its way through and the piece is condemned to the rubbish heap in the motorroom are scores of cylinders crankcases and gears ready for finishing here the outside of bored cylinders is touched up by files to remove any marks and rough projections left by the moulds the crankcases of aluminium are taken in hand by men who chisel the edges where the two halves fit chipping off the metal with wonderful skill and precision the edges are then ground smooth and after the halves have been accurately fitted the holes for the bolts connecting them are drilled in a special machine which presents a drill to each hole in succession having seen the various operations which a cylinder has to go through we pass into another shop given up to long lines of benches where various motor parts are being completed each piece however small is treated as of the utmost importance since the failure of even a tiny pin may bring the largest car to a standstill we see a man testing pump discs against a standard template to prove their absolute accuracy close by another man is finishing a flywheel chipping off specks of metal to make the balance true we now understand that machine tools cannot utterly displace the human hand and eye the fitters with touches of the file remove matter in such minute quantities that its removal might seem of no consequence but matter in the wrong place is the cause of many breakdowns we should naturally expect that engines cast from the same pattern handled by the same machines finished by the same men would give identical results but as two bicycles of similar make will run differently so do engines of one type develop peculiarities the motors are therefore taken into a testingroom and bolted to two rows of benches forty at a time here they run under power for long periods creating a deafening uproar until all parts work sweetly the power of the engines is tested by harnessing them to dynamos and noting the amount of current developed at a certain speed we might linger in the departments where accumulators sparking plugs and other parts of the electrical apparatus of a car are made or in the laboratory where chemists pry into the results of a new alloy aided by powerful microscopes and marvellously delicate scales but we will stop only to note the powerful machine which is stretching and crushing metal to ascertain its toughness no care in experimenting is spared the chemist poring over his test tubes plays as important a part in the construction of a car as the foundry man or the turner the machineshop is an objectlesson among the tools noticed in previous chapters of this book here is a huge planing machine travelling to and fro over a copper bar a crank shaft has been cut out of solid steel by boring holes close together through a thick plate and the two sides of the plate have been broken off leaving the rough shaft with its edges composed of a considerable number of semicircles the shaft is slowly rotated on a lathe and tiny clouds of smoke arise as the tool nicks off pieces of metal to reduce the shaft to a circular shape other machines with highspeed tool steel are finishing gear shafts flywheels are being turned and worm shafts cut all these laborious operations are carried out by the machines each under the control of one man whose mind is intent upon the work ready to stop the machine or adjust the material as may be required as a contrast to the heavy machines we will pass to the light automatic tools which are grouped in a gallery the eye is bewildered by the moving mass but the whirling of the pulley shafts and the clicking of the capstan lathes is soothing to the ear while the mind is greatly impressed by the ingenuity of man in suppressing labour by means of machines of which half a dozen can be easily looked after by one hand who has nothing to do but to see that they are fed with material a rod of steel is put into the machine and the turret with half a dozen different tools presents first one and then the other to the end of the rod bathed in thick oil so that it is rapidly turned bored and shaped into caps nuts bolts and the scores of other little accessories required in fitting up a motorcar on seeing how all this work is done mechanically and methodically with scarcely any other expense but the capital required in the upkeep of the machines and in driving them one wonders how the automobile industry could be carried on without this laboursaving mechanism in any event if all these little pieces had to be turned out by hand it is certain that the cost of the motorcar would be considerably more than it is even if it did not reach to such a figure as to make it prohibitive to all but wealthy buyers down one side of the gallery the machines are engaged in cutting gears with so much precision that when tested by turning them together on pins on a bench at the end of the gallery it is very rare indeed that any one of them is found defective this installation of automatic tools is one of the largest of its kind in a motorcar works if not in any engineering shop and each one has been carefully selected in view of its efficiency for particular classes of work so that we see machines from america england france and germany in the fittingshops the multitude of parts are assembled to form the chassis or mechanical carriage of the car to which in a separate shop is added the body for the accommodation of passengers the whole is painted and carefully varnished after it has been out on the road for trials to discover any weak spot in its anatomy then the car is ready for sale when one considers the racketing that a highpowered car has to stand and the high speed of its moving parts one can understand why those parts must be made so carefully and precisely and also how this care must conduce to the expense of the finished article it has been said that it is easy to make a good watch but difficult to make a good motor; for though they both require an equal amount of exactitude and skill the latter has to stand much more wear in proportion when you look at a firstgrade car bearing a great maker's name you have under your eyes one of the most wonderful pieces of mechanism the world can show we will not leave the de dionbouton works without a further glance at the human element the company never have a slack time and consequently can employ the same number of people all the year round they pride themselves on the fact that the great majority of the men have been in their employ for several years with the result that they have around them a class of workmen who are steady reliable and above all skilful in the particular work they are engaged upon there are more than men and about women these latter being employed chiefly in the manufacture of sparking plugs and in other departments where there is no night work they are mostly the wives or widows of old workmen and in thus finding employment for them the firm provides for those who would otherwise be left without resource and at the same time earns the gratitude of their employés notethe author gratefully acknowledges the help given by messrs de dionbouton ltd in providing materials for this account of their works  the motor omnibus prior to the emancipation of the road automobile in permission had been granted to corporations to run trams driven by mechanical power through towns the steam tram its engine protected by a case which hid the machinery from the view of restive horses panted up and down our streets drawing one or more vehicles behind it the electric tram presently came over from america and soon established its superiority to the steamer with respect to speed freedom from smell and smoke and noiselessness the system generally adopted was that invented in by frank j sprague in which an overhead cable supported on posts or slung from wires spanning the track carries current to a trolley arm projecting from the vehicle the return current passes through the rails which are made electrically continuous by having their individual lengths either welded together or joined by metal strips in america where wide streets and rapidly growing cities are the rule the electric tramway serves very useful ends; the best proof of its utility being the total mileage of the tracks statistics for show that since the mileage had increased from to miles; and the number of passengers carried from to or an increase of · per cent it is interesting to note that electricity has in the united states almost completely ousted steam and animal traction so far as street cars are concerned; since the miles once served by animal power have dwindled to and steam can claim only miles of track next to the united states comes germany as a user of electricity for tractive purposes; though she is a very bad second with only about miles of track; and england takes third place with about miles that the british isles so well provided with railways should be so poorly equipped with tramways is comprehensible when we consider the narrowness of the streets of her largest towns where a good service of public vehicles is most needed the installation of a tramline necessitates the tearing up of a street and in many cases the closing of that street to traffic we can hardly imagine the dislocation of business that would result from such a blockage of say the strand and high holborn; but since it has been calculated that no less than five millions of pounds sterling are lost to our great metropolis yearly by the obstructions of gas water telegraph and telephone operations which only partially close a thoroughfare or by the relaying of the road surface which is not a very lengthy matter if properly conducted we might reckon the financial loss resulting from the laying of tramrails at many millions even were they laid the trouble would not cease for a tram is confined to its track and cannot make way for other traffic this inadaptability has been the cause of the great outcry lately raised against the way in which tramline companies have monopolised the main streets and approaches to many of our largest towns while the electric tram is beneficial to a large class of people as a cheap method of locomotion between home and business it sadly handicaps all owners of vehicles vexatiously delayed by the tram at brentford to take a notorious example the double tramline so completely fills the high street that it is at places impossible for a cart or carriage to remain at the kerbstone another charge levelled with justice at the tramline is that the rails and their setting are dangerous to cyclists motorists and even heavy vehicles especially in wet weather when the sideslip demon becomes a real terror english municipalities are therefore faced by a serious problem improved locomotion is necessary; how can it best be provided? by smoothrunning luxurious welllighted electric trams travelling over a track laid at great expense and a continual nuisance to a large section of the community; or by vehicles independent of a central source of power and free to move in any direction according to the needs of the traffic? where tramways exist those responsible for laying them at the rate of several thousand pounds per mile are naturally reluctant to abandon them but where the fixed track has not yet arrived an alternative method of transport is open viz the automobile omnibus quite recently we have seen in london and other towns a great increase in the number of motor buses which often ply far out into the country from the point of speed they are very superior to the horsed vehicle and statistics show that they are also less costly to run in proportion to the fares carried while passengers will unanimously acknowledge their greater comfort to change from the ancient rattling twohorse conveyance which jolts us on rough roads and occasionally sends a thrill up the spine when the brakes are applied to the roomy steam or petroldriven bus which overtakes and threads its way through the slower traffic is a pleasant experience so the motor buses are crowded while the horsed rivals on the same route trundle along half empty since the one class of vehicles can travel at an average pace of ten miles an hour as against the four miles an hour of the other no wonder that this should be so even if the running costs of a motor bus for a given distance exceed that of an electric tram we must remember that whereas a bus runs on already existing roads an immense amount of capital must be sunk in laying the track for the tram and the interest on this sum has to be added to the total running costs the next decade will probably decide whether automobiles or trams are to serve the needs of the community in districts where at present no efficient service of any kind exists in london motor buses are being placed on the roads by scores and the day cannot be far distant when the horse will disappear from the bus as it is already fast vanishing from the front of the tram both petrol and steam and in some cases a combination of petrol and electricity are used to propel the motor bus it has not yet been decided which form of power yields the best results petrol is probably the cheaper fuel but steam gives the quieter running; and could electric storage batteries be made sufficiently light and durable they would have a strong claim to precedence there has lately appeared a new form of accumulatorthe von rothmundwhich promises well since weight for weight it far exceeds in capacity any other type and is so constructed that it will stand a lot of rough usage a car fitted with a von rothmund battery scaling about lbs has run miles on one charge and it is anticipated that with improvements in motors a lb battery will readily be run miles as against the miles in the case of a lead battery of equal weight there is a large sphere open to the motor bus outside districts where the electric tram would enter into serious competition with it we have before us a sketchmap of the great western railway one of the most enterprising systems with regard to its use of motors to feed its rails no less than thirty road services are in operation and their number is being steadily augmented in fact it looks as if in the near future the motor service will largely supplant the branch railway blessed with very few trains a day a motor bus service plying every halfhour between a town and the nearest important mainline station would be more valuable to the inhabitants than half a dozen trains a day especially if the passenger vehicles were supplemented by lorries for the carriage of luggage and heavy goods in this connection we may notice an invention of m renarda motor train of several vehicles towed by a single engine we have all seen the tractionengine puffing along with its tail of trucks and been impressed by the weight of the locomotive and also by the manner in which the train occupies a road when passing a corner the weight is necessary to give sufficient grip to move the whole train while the spreading of the vehicles across the thoroughfare on a curve arises from the fact that each vehicle does not follow the path of that preceding it but describes part of a smaller circle m renard has in his motor train evaded the need for a heavy tractor by providing every vehicle with a pair of driving wheels and transmitting the power to those wheels by a special flexible propeller shaft which passes from the powerful motor on the leading vehicle under all the other vehicles engaging in succession with mechanism attached to all the driving axles in this manner each car yields its quotum of adhesion for its own propulsion and the necessity for great weight is obviated special couplings ensure that the path taken by the tractor shall be faithfully followed by all its followers a motor train of this description has travelled from paris to berlin and drawn to itself a great deal of attention will it asks a writer in the world's work ultimately displace the conventional tractionengine and its heavy trailing waggons? every municipality and county council is only too painfully cognisant of the dire effects upon the roads exercised by the cumbrous wheels of these unwieldy locomotives and trains with the renard train however the trailing coaches can be of light construction carried on ordinary wheels which do not cut up or otherwise damage the roadway surface many other advantages inherent in such a train might be enumerated the most important however are the flexibility of the whole train; its complete control; faster speed without any attendant danger; its remarkable braking arrangements as afforded by the continuous propeller shaft gearing directly with the drivingwheels of each carriage; its low cost of maintenance serviceability and instant use; and the reduction in the number of men requisite for the attention of the train while on a journey were the system a success it would find plenty of scope to convey passengers and commodities through districts too sparsely populated to render a railway profitable people would talk about travelling or sending goods by the tenthirty motor train just as now we speak of the elevenfifteen to town as a carrier and distributer of mails the motor van has already established a position to quote but a couple of instances there are the services between london and brighton and liverpool and manchester in the isle of wight motor omnibuses connect all the principal towns and villages each bus is a travelling postoffice in which by an arrangement with the postmastergeneral anybody may post letters at the recognised stoppingplaces or whenever the vehicle has halted for any purpose in paris london berlin the motor mail van is a common sight it has even penetrated the interior of india where the maharajah of gwalior uses a specially fitted steam car for the delivery of his private mails and as though to show that man alone shall not profit by the new mode of locomotion paris owns a motorcar which conveys lost dogs from the different policestations to the dogs' home! in fact there seems to be no purpose to which a horsedrawn vehicle can be put which either has not been or shortly will be invaded by the motor  railway motorcars in the early days of railway construction vehicles were used which combined a steam locomotive with an ordinary passenger carriage after being abandoned for many years the steam carriage was revived in by the london and south western and great western railways for local service and the handling of passenger traffic on branch lines since that year rail motorcars have multiplied; some being run by steam others by petrol engines and others again by electricity generated by petrol engines the first class we need not describe in any detail as it presents no features of peculiar interest the north eastern has had in use two railmotors each fiftytwo feet long with a compartment at each end for the driver and a central saloon to carry fiftytwo passengers an hp fourcylindered wolseley petrol motor drives a westinghouse electric generator which sends current into a couple of hp electric motors geared to the runningwheels an air compressor fitted to the rear bogie supplies the westinghouse air brakes while in addition a powerful electric brake is fitted acting on the rails as well as the wheels the coach scales thirtyfive tons the chief advantage of this composite system of power transmission is that the engine is kept running at a constant speed while the power it develops at the electric motors is regulated by switches which control the action of the armature and field magnets when heavy work must be done the engine is supplied with more gaseous mixture and the generators are so operated as to develop full power in this manner all the variable speed gears and clutches necessary when the petrol motor is connected to the drivingwheels are done away with the latter system gives however greater economy of fuel and the great northern railway has adopted it in preference to the petrolelectric this railway has many small branch lines running through thinly populated districts which though important as feeders of the main tracks are often worked at a loss a satisfactory type of automobile carriage would not only avoid this loss but also largely prevent the competition of road motors the car should be powerful enough to draw an extra van or two on occasion since horses and heavy luggage may sometimes accompany the passengers messrs dick kerr and company have built a car which when loaded with its complement of passengers weighs about sixteen tons the motive power is supplied by two fourcylinder petrol engines of the daimler type each giving hp these are suspended on a special frame independent of that which carries the coach body so that the passengers are not troubled by the vibration of the engines even when the vehicle is at rest the great feature of the car is the lightness of the machineryonly two tons in weightthough it develops sufficient power to move the carriage at fifty miles per hour after travelling miles the machinery showed no appreciable signs of wear; so that the company considers that it has found a reliable type of motor for the working of the short line between hatfield and hertford since one man can drive a petrol car while twoa driver and a stokerare necessary on a steam car a considerable reduction in wages will result from the employment of these vehicles engineers find motortrolleys very convenient for inspecting the lines under their care on the london and south western railway a trolley driven by a hp engine and provided with a changegear giving six fifteen and thirty miles per hour in either direction is at work it seats four persons in the colonies notably in south africa where coal and wood fuel is scarce or expensive the motortrolley capable of carrying petrol for miles' travel is rapidly gaining ground among railway inspectors makers are turning their attention to petrol shunting engines useful in goods yards mines sewerage works firms such as messrs maudslay and company of coventry; the wolseley tool and motor car company; messrs panhard and levassor; messrs kerr stuart and company have brought out locomotives of this kind which will draw loads up to sixty tons the fact that a petrol engine is ready for work at a moment's notice and when idle is not eating its head off and has no furnace or boiler to require attention is very much in its favour where comparatively light loads have to be hauled chapter viii the motor afloat pleasure boatsmotor lifeboatsmotor fishing boatsa motor fire floatthe mechanism of the motor boatthe twostroke motormotor boats for the navy  having made such conquests on land and rendered possible aerial feats which could scarcely have been performed by steam the explosion motor further vindicates its versatility by its fine exploits in the water at the paris exhibition of gottlieb daimler the inventor who made the petrol engine commercially valuable as an aid to locomotion showed a small gasdriven boat which by most visitors to the exhibition was mistaken for an ordinary steam launch and attracted little interest not deterred by this want of appreciation mr daimler continued to perfect the idea for which with a prophet's eye he saw great possibilities; and soon motor launches became a fairly common sight on german rivers they were received with some enthusiasm in the united states as being particularly suitable for the inland lakes and waterways with which that country is so abundantly blessed; but met with small recognition from the english who might reasonably have been expected to take great interest in any new nautical invention now however english manufacturers have awaked fully to their error; and on all sides we see boats built by firms competing for the lead in an industry which in a few years' time may reach colossal proportions illustration a modern car and boat in the background is the racing motor boat napier ii which on a trial trip travelled over the measured mile at · miles per hour in the foreground is a napier racing car which has attained a speed of · miles per hour until quite recently the marine motor was a small affair developing only a few horsepower but because the gasengine for automobile work had been so vastly improved in the last decade it attracted notice as a rival to steam for driving launches and pleasure boats and soon asserted itself as a reliable mover of vessels of considerable size to promote the development of the industry to test the endurance of the machine and to show the weak spots of mechanical design trials and races were organised on much the same lines as those which have kept the motorcar so prominently before the publicraces in the solent across the channel and across the mediterranean the speed as in the case of cars has risen very rapidly with the motor boat when in february a napier racer did some trial spins over the measured mile in the thames at long reach she attained · miles per hour on the first run on turning the tide was favourable and the figures rose to · mph while the third improved on this by over a mile her mean speed was · mph or about mph better than the previous recordstanding to the credit of the american challenger the latter had however the still waters of a lake for her venue so that the napier's performance was actually even more creditable than the mere figures would seem to imply at a luncheon which concluded the trial mr yarrow who had built the steel hull said to give an idea of what an advance the adoption of the internal combustion engine really represents i should like to state that if we were asked to guarantee the best speed we could with a boat of the size of napier ii fitted with the latest form of steam machinery of as reliable a character as the internal combustion engine in the present boat we should not like to name more than sixteen knots so that it may be taken that the adoption of the internal combustion engine in place of the steamengine for a vessel of this size really represents an additional speed of ten knots an hour i should here point out that the speed of a vessel increases rapidly with its size for example in what is termed a secondclass torpedo boat sixty feet in length the best speed we could obtain would be twenty knots; but for a vessel of say feet in length with similar but proportionately larger machinery a speed of thirty knots could be obtained therefore the obtaining of a speed of practically twentysix knots in the yarrownapier boat only forty feet in length points to the possibility in the not fardistant future of propelling a vessel feet in length at even fortyfive knots per hour all that remains to be done is to perfect the internal combustion engine so as to enable large sizes to be successfully made boats of hp and upwards are being built; and the project has been mooted of holding a transatlantic race open to motor boats of all sizes which should be quite selfcontained and able to carry sufficient fuel to make the passage without taking in fresh supplies in view of the perils that would be risked by all but large craft and in consideration of the prejudice that motor boats might incur in event of any fatalities the automobile club of france set its face against the venture and it fell through it is possible however that the scheme may be revived as soon as larger motor boats are afloat since the atlantic has actually been crossed by a craft of hp measuring only forty feet at the waterline this happened in when captain newman and his son a boy twelve years old started from new york and made falmouth harbour after thirty days of anxious travel over the uncertain and sometimes tempestuous ocean the boat named the abiel abbot low carried auxiliary sails of small size and was not by any means built for such a voyage the enginea twocylinderburned kerosene captain newman received £ from the new york kerosene oil engine company for his feat the money was well earned though provided with proper navigating instrumentswhich he knew how to use wellnewman had a hard time of it to keep his craft afloat his watches sometimes lasting two days on end when the weather was bad yet the brave pair won through; and probably even more welcome than the sense of success achieved and the reward gained was the long twodays' sleep which they were able to get on reaching falmouth harbour  pleasure boats we may now consider the pleasure and commercial uses of the motor boat and marine motor as a means of recreation a small dinghy driven by a lowpowered engine offers great possibilities its cost is low its upkeep small and its handiness very great already a number of such craft are furrowing the surface of the thames seine rhine and many other rivers in europe and america while racing craft are for the wealthy alone many individuals of the class known as the man of moderate means do not mind putting down £ to £ for a neat boat the maintenance of which is not nearly so serious a matter as that of a small car tyre troubles have no counterpart afloat the marine motor dispenses with change gears water being a much more yielding medium than mother earth the shocks of starting and stopping are not such as to strain machinery then again the cooling of the cylinders is a simple matter with an unlimited amount of water almost washing the engine and as the surface of water does not run uphill a small motor will show to better advantage on a river than on a road thus a hp car will not conveniently carry more than two people if it is expected to climb slopes at more than a crawl affix a motor of equal power to a boat which accommodates half a dozen persons and it will move them all along at a smart pace as compared with the rate of travel given by oars after all on a river one does not want to travel fastrather to avoid the hard labour which rowing undoubtedly does become with a craft roomy enough to be comfortable for a party the marine motor also scores under the heading of adaptability a wagonette could not be converted into a motorcar with any success but a goodsized rowboat may easily blossom out as a useful selfpropelled boat you may buy complete apparatusmotor tanks screw batteries etcfor clamping direct on to the stern and there you area motor boat while you wait! even more sudden still is the conversion effected by the motogodille which may be described as a motor screw and rudder in one the makers are the buchet company a wellknown french firm engine and carburetter petrol tank coil accumulator lubricating oil reservoir exhaust box propeller shaft and propeller with guard are all provided so that the outfit requires no additional accessories for mounting in position at the stern of the boat the complete set is balanced on a standard and carries a steering arm on which the tanks are mounted; and also the stern tube and propeller guard which are in one solid piece in addition to the engine in order that no balancing feats shall be required of the person in charge there is on the supporting standard a quadrant in the notches of which a lever on the engine frame engages thus allowing the rigid framework and therefore the propeller shaft to be maintained at any angle to the vertical without trouble the hp engine drives a boat feet long by feet inches beam at miles per hour through still water as the motogodille can be swerved to right or left on its standard it acts as a very efficient rudder while its action takes no way off the boat for people who like an easy life on hot summer days reclining on soft cushions and peeping up through the branches which overhang picturesque streams there is the motor punt which can move in water so shallow that it would strand even a rowboat the oxford undergraduate of tomorrow will explore the leafy recesses of the cher not with the long pole laboriously raised and pushed aft but by the power of a snug little motor throbbing gently at the stern and on the open river we shall see the steam launch replaced by craft having much better accommodation for passengers while free from the dirt and smells which are inseparable from the use of steampower the petrol launch will rival the electric in spaciousness and the steamer in its speed and power size for size some people have an antipathy to this new form of river locomotion on account of the risks which accompany the presence of petrol were a motor launch to ignite in say boulter's lock on a summer sunday or at the henley regatta there might indeed be a catastrophe the same danger has before now been flaunted in the face of the automobilist on land; yet cases of the accidental ignition of cars are very very rare and on the water would be more rare still because the tanks can be more easily examined for leaks still it behoves every owner of a launch to keep his eye very widely open for leakage because any escaping liquid would create a collection of gas in the bottom of the boat from which it could not escape like the gas forming from drops spilled on the road illustration photo branger & cie paris the motogodille the motogodille or motor rudder consists of a screw propeller fitted to a small buchet motor the whole apparatus is mounted on a standard in the stern and the operator by moving the inboard arm to right or left can steer the boat as he wishes a hp motor gives a speed of to miles an hour the future popularity of the motor boat is assured the waterside dweller will find it invaluable as a means of carrying him to other parts of the stream the longshoreman will be able to venture much further out to sea than he could while he depended on muscles or wind alone and with much greater certainty of returning up to time a whole network of waterways intersects civilised countriesoften far better kept than the roadsoffering fresh fields for the tourist to conquer river scenery and beautiful scenery more often than not go together the car or cycle may be able to follow the course of a stream from source to mouth; yet this is the exception rather than the rule we shoot over the stream in the train or on our machines; note that it looks picturesque; wonder vaguely whither it flows and whence it comes; and continue our journey recking little of the charming sights to be seen by anyone who would trust himself to the water hitherto the great difficulty has been one of locomotion in a narrow stream sailing is generally out of the question; haulage by man or beast becomes tedious even if possible; and rowing day after day presupposes a good physical condition in the motor boat the holiday maker has an ideal craft it occupies little room; can carry fuel sufficient for long distances; is unwearying; and is economical as regards its running expenses we ought not to be surprised therefore if in a few years the jaded business man turns as naturally to a spin or trip on the rivers and canals of his country as he now turns to his car and a rush over the dusty highway then will begin another era for the disused canal the vegetationchoked stream; and our maps will pay more attention to the paths which nature has waterworn in the course of the ages to the scientific explorer also the motor affords valuable help many countries in which roads are practically nonexistent can boast fine rivers fed by innumerable streams what fields of adventure sport and science would be open to the possessor of a fast launch on the amazon the congo the mackenzie or the orinoco provided only that he could occasionally replenish his fuel tanks!  motor lifeboats turning to the more serious side of life we find the marine motor still much in evidence on account of its comparatively short existence it is at present only in the experimental stage in many applications and time must pass before its position is fully established take for instance the motor lifeboat lately built for the royal national lifeboat institution here are encountered difficulties of a kind very different from those of a racing craft a lifeboat is most valuable in rough weather which means more or less water often coming aboard if the water reached the machinery troubles with the electrical ignition apparatus would result so the motor must be enclosed in a watertight compartment and if so enclosed it must be specially reliable also since a lifeboat sometimes upsets the machinery needs to be so disposed as not to interfere with her selfrighting qualities the list might easily be extended an account of the first motor lifesaver will interest readers so we once again have recourse to the chief authority on such topicsthe motor boatfor particulars the boat selected for experiment was an old one formerly stationed at folkestone measuring thirtyeight feet long by eight feet beam pulling twelve oars doublebanked and of the usual selfrighting type rigged with jib forelug and mizzen after she had been hauled up in mr guy's yard where some of the aircases under the deck amidships were taken out a strong mahogany case measuring four feet long by three feet wide and as high as the gunwales lined with sheet copper so as to be watertight with a closefitting lid which could be easily removed on shore was fitted in place and the whole of the vital parts of the machinery comprising a twocylinder motor of hp together with all the necessary pumps carburetter electric equipment etc were fitted inside this case the engine drives a threebladed propeller through a long shaft with a disconnecting clutch between so that for starting or stopping temporarily the screw can be disconnected from the engine the petrol which serves as fuel for the engine is carried in a metal tank stored away inside the forward end box where it is beyond any possibility of accidental damage sufficient fuel for a continuous run of over ten hours is carried the engine is started by a handle fitted on the fore side of the case which can be worked by two men the position and size of the enginecase is such that only two oars are interfered with but it does not follow that the propelling power of the two displaced men is entirely lost because they can double bank some of the other oars when necessary fitted thus the lifeboat was tested in all sorts of weather during the month of april and it was found that she could be driven fairly well against a sea by means of the motor alone; but when it was used to assist the sails the true use of the motor as an auxiliary became apparent and the boat would work to windward in a way previously unattainable neither the pitching or rolling in a seaway in any weather then obtainable interfered at all with the proper working or starting of the motor which worked steadily and well throughout having been through these preliminary tests she was more severely tried running over the measured mile with full crew and stores on board she developed over six knots an hour the men were then replaced by equivalent weights lashed to the thwarts and she was capsized by a crane four times her sails set and the sheets made fast yet she righted herself without difficulty an interesting feature of the capsize was that the motor stopped automatically when the boat had partly turned over this arrangement prevents her from running away from the crew if they should be pitched out the motor started again after a few turns of the handle so proving that the protecting compartment had kept the water at bay from this account it is obvious that a valuable aid to lifesaving at sea has been found the steam lifeboat propelled by a jet of water squirted out by pumps below the water line is satisfactory so long as the boat keeps upright but in event of an upset the fires must necessarily be extinguished no such disability attends the petroldriven craft and we shall be glad to think that the brave fellows who risk their lives in the cause of humanity will be spared the intense physical toil which a long row to windward in a heavy sea entails the general adoption of this new ally will take time and must depend largely on the liberality of subscribers to the fine institution responsible for lifeboat maintenance; but it is satisfactory to learn that the committee has given the boat in question a practical chance in the open sea by stationing her at newhaven sussex as a unit in the lifeboat fleet  motor fishing boats it is a pretty sight to watch a fishing fleet enter the harbour with its catch taken far away on the waters beyond the horizon while landsmen slept the sails some white some brown some wondrously patched and bearing the visible marks of many a hard fight with the wind belly out in graceful lines as the boats slip past the harbour entrance no wonder that the painter has so often found subjects for his canvas and brushes among the toilers of the deep but underlying the romance and picturesqueness of the craft there is stern business those boats may be returning with full cargoes such as will yield good profits to owner and crew; or on the other hand the hold may be empty and many honest hearts be heavy at the thought of wasted days a few years ago the yarmouth herring fleet is said to have returned on one occasion with but a single fish to the credit of the whole fleet! this might have been a mere figure of speech; it stands at any rate for many thousands of pounds lost by the hardy fishermen when the boats have been made fast the fish if already disentangled from the nets is usually sold at once by auction the price depending largely on the individual size and freshness of the catch now with the increase in the number of boats and from other causes the waters near home have been so well fished over that much longer journeys must be made to the grounds than were formerly necessary trawling that is dragging a large bagnetits mouth kept open by a beam and weightsalong the bottom of the sea for flatfish has long been performed by powerful steam vessels which may any day be seen leaving or entering hull or grimsby in large numbers surface fishing wherein a long driftnet weighted at its lower edge and buoyed at the upper edge to enable it to keep a perpendicular position is used for herring and mackerel and in this industry wind power alone is generally used by british fishermen the herringboat sets sail for the grounds in the morning and at sundown should be at the scene of action her nets aggregating perhaps a mile in length are then shot and the boat drifts along towing the line behind her if fish appear the nets are hauled in soon after daybreak by the aid of a capstan the labour of bringing a mile of nets aboard is very severeso severe in fact that the larger boats in many cases employ the help of a small steamengine during the return voyage the fish is freed from the meshes and thrown into the hold ready for sale as soon as land is reached fish whether for salting or immediate consumption should be fresh no class of human food seems to deteriorate so quickly when life is extinct as the denizens of the deep so that it is of primary importance to fishermen that their homeward journey should be performed in the shortest possible time if winds are contrary or absent there may be such delay as to need the liberal use of salt and even that useful commodity will not stave off a fall in value it therefore often happens that a really fine catch arrives at its market in a condition which spells heavy loss to the catchers a slow return also means missing a day's fishing which may represent £ to £ for this reason the dogger bank fishing fleet is served by steam tenders which carry off the catches as they are made and thus obviate the necessity for a boat's return to port when its hold is full such a system will not however be profitable to boats owned by individuals and working within a comparatively short distance of land each boat must depend on its particular powers the first to return getting rather better prices than those which come with the crowd so steam power is in some cases installed as an auxiliary to the sails though it may entail the outlay of £ as first cost and a big bill for upkeep and management small men cannot afford this expense and they would be doomed to watch their richer brethren slip into the market before them had not the explosion motor come to their aid this just meets their case; it is not nearly so expensive to install as steam occupies much less room is easier to handle and therefore saves the expense of trained attendants fishermen are notoriously conservative to them a change from methods sanctioned by many years of practice is abhorrent what sufficed for their fathers they say should suffice for them their trade is so uncertain that a bad season would see no return for the cost of the motor since where no fish are caught it makes little difference whether the journey to port be quick or slow however the motor is bound to come it has been applied to fishing boats with marked success while the nets are out the motor is stopped and costs not a penny more till the time comes for hauling in then it is geared up with a capstan and saves the crew much of their hardest work when all is aboard the capstan hands over the power to the screw which together with the sails propels the vessel homewards at a smart pace the skipper is certain of making land in good time for the market; and he will be ready for the out voyage next morning another point in favour of the motor is that when storms blow up the fleet will be able to run for shelter even if the wind be adverse; and we should hear less of the sacrifice of life which makes sad reading after every severe gale as to the machinery to be employed mr f miller of oulton broad who first applied the gasmotor to a fishing smackthe pioneerconsiders that a hp engine would suffice as an auxiliary for small craft of the class found in the northern parts of great britain the norfolk boats would require a hp; and a fullpowered boatie one that could depend on the motor entirelyshould carry a threecylinder engine of hp in any case the machinery must be enclosed and well protected; while the lubrication arrangements should be such as to be understood easily by unskilled persons and absolutely reliable owing to the moisture in the atmosphere the ordinary hightension coil ignition such as is used on most motorcars would not prove efficient and it is therefore replaced by a lowtension type which makes and breaks the primary circuit by means of a rocking arm working through the walls of the cylinder lastly all parts which require occasional examination or adjustment must be easily accessible so that they may receive proper attention at sea and not send the vessel home a lame duck under sail the advantages of the motor are so great that the scotch authorities have taken the matter up seriously appointing an expert to make inquiries it is therefore quite possible that before many years have elapsed the motor will play an important part in the task of supplying our breakfast tables with the dainty sole or toothsome herring  a motor fire float as a good instance of this particular adaptation of the explosion engine to fireextinction work we may quote the apparatus now in attendance on the huge factory of messrs huntley and palmer the famous reading biscuit makers the factory lies along the banks of the river kennet which are joined by bridges so close to the water that a steamer could not pass under them messrs merryweather accordingly built the motor float feet long feet beam and drawing inches two engines each having four cylinders of a total of hp drive two sets of threecylinder hatfield pumps which give a continuous feed to the hose engines and pumps are mounted on a single bedplate and are worked separately unless it be found advisable to siamese the hoses to feed a single inch jet which can be flung to a great height one of the most interesting features of the float is the method of propulsion as its movements are limited to a few hundred yards the fitting of a screw was considered unnecessary its place being taken by four jets two at each end through which water is forced against the outside water by the extinguishing pumps these will move the float either forward or astern steer her or turn her round so here once again petrol has trodden upon the toes of giant steam and very effectively too  the mechanism of the motor boat in many points the marine motor reproduces the machinery built into cars the valve arrangements governors design of cylinders and waterjackets are practically the same small boats carry one cylinder or perhaps two just as a small car is content with the same number; but a racing or heavy boat employs four six and in one case at least twelve cylinders which abolish all dead points and enable the screw to work very slowly without engine vibration as the drive is continuous the large marine motor is designed to run at a slower rate than the land motor and its cylinders are therefore of greater size some of the cylinders exhibited in the automobile show at the london olympia seemed enormous when compared with those doing duty on even highpowered cars; being more suggestive of the parts of an electric lighting plant than of a machine which has to be tucked away in a boat except for the reversing gear gearing is generally absent on the motor boat the chauffeur has not to keep changing his speed lever from one notch to another according to the nature of the country on the sea conditions are more consistently favourable or unfavourable and as in a steamboat speed is controlled by opening or closing the throttle the screw will always be turned by the machinery but its effect on the boat must depend on its size and the forces acting in opposition to it since water is yielding it does not offer a parallel to the road should a car meet a hill too steep for its climbing powers the engines must come to rest the wheel does not slip on the road and so long as there is sufficient power it will force the car up the severest incline; as soon as the power proves too small for the task in hand the car lies down in a motor boat however the engine may keep the screw moving without doing more against wind and tide than prevent the boat from advancing backwards the only way to make the boat efficient to meet all possible conditions would be to increase the size or alter the pitch of the screw and to install more powerful engines gearing downas in a motorcarbeing useless the only mechanism needed on a motor boat in connection with the transmission of power from cylinders to screw is the reversing gear though engines have been designed with devices for reversing by means of the cams operating the valves the reversal of the screw's movement is generally effected through gears on the transmission apparatus the simplest arrangement though not the most perfect mechanically is a reversible screw the blades of which can be made to feather this way or that by the movement of a lever sometimes two screws are employed with opposite twists the one doing duty while the other revolves idly but for fast and heavy boats a single solid screw with immovable blades is undoubtedly preferable; its reversal being effected by means of friction clutches the inelasticity of the explosion motor renders it necessary that the change be made gradually or the kick of the screw against the motor might cause breakages the clutch gradually engaging with a disc revolved by the propeller shaft first stops the antagonistic motion and then converts it into similar motion many devices have been invented to bring this about but as a description of them would not be interesting we pass on to a consideration of the fuel used in the motor boat petrol has the upper hand at present yet heavier oil must eventually prevail on account both of its cheapness and of its greater safety the only objection to its use is the difficulty attending the starting of the engine with kerosene; and this is met by using petrol till the engine and carburetter are hot and then switching on the petroleum when once the carburetter has been warmed by exhaust gases to about ° fahrenheit it will work as well with the heavy as with the light fuel since any oil or spirit may leak from its tanks and cause danger an effort has been made to substitute solid for liquid fuel the substance selected is naphthalenewell known as a protector of clothes against moths at the olympia automobile exhibition of the writer saw an enginethe chenier leonwhich had been run with balls of this chemical fed to the carburetter through a meltingpot for a description of this engine we must once again have recourse to the motor boat the inventors had decided to test its performance with petrol paraffin and naphthalene respectively the motor screwed to a testing bench was connected by the usual belt to a dynamo so that the power developed under each variety of fuel might be electrically measured and was then started up on petrol as soon as the parts were sufficiently warmed up by the exhaust heat the petrol was turned off and the motor run for some time on paraffin until sufficient naphthalene was thoroughly melted to the consistency of a thick syrup the naphthalene was then fed to its mixing valve through a small pipe dipping into the bottom of the meltingpot and thence sprayed into the induction chamber to carburate the air therein hitherto the motor had given an average of electrical hp at revolutions per minute and it was noticed that as soon as the change was made this was fully maintained this test when continued bore out others which had previously been made by the firm and showed the consumption of each of the three fuels to be a little over lbs per hour for the electrical hp given by the motor still the paraffin and naphthalene worked out about equal as to cost and considering that the latter was in its purest form as sold for a clothes preservative we have yet to see how much better its commercial showing will be with lower grades assuming beforehand that its thermal efficiency and behaviour are as good on the ground of convenience naphthalene as a solid is a very long way in front of its liquid rival kerosene its exhaust too was much freer from odour and it appears that unlike paraffin it forms neither tar soot nor sticky matter but on the contrary has a tendency to brighten all valves cylinders walls etc any little deposit being a light powder which would be carried into the exhaust  the twostroke motor in the ordinary ottocycle motor an explosion occurs once in every two revolutions of the crank with a single cylinder the energy of the explosion must be stored up in a heavy flywheel to carry the engine through the three other operations of scavenging sucking in a fresh charge and compressing it preparatory to the next explosion with two cylinders the flywheel can be made lighter as an explosion occurs every revolution; and in a fourcylinder engine we might almost dispense with the wheel altogether since the drive is continuous just as in a doublecylindered steamengine the twostroke motor ie one which makes an explosion for every revolution is an attempt to unite the advantages of a twocylindered engine of the otto type with the lightness of a singlecylindered engine as it has been largely used for motor boats especially in america a short description of its working may be given here in the first place all moving cylinder valves are done away with their functions being performed by openings covered and opened by the movements of the piston the crank chamber is quite gastight and has in it a nonreturn valve through which vapour is drawn from the carburetter every time the piston moves away from the centre there is also a pipe connecting it with the lower part of the cylinder but the other end of this is covered by the piston until it has all but finished its stroke let us suppose that an explosion has just taken place the piston rushes downwards compressing the gas in the crank chamber to some extent when the stroke is threeparts performed a second hole on the opposite side of the cylinder from the aperture already referred to is uncovered by the piston and the exploded gases partly escape immediately afterwards the second hole is uncovered also and the fresh charge rushes in from the crank case being deflected upwards by a plate on the top of the piston so as to help drive out the exhaust products the returning piston covers both holes and compresses the charge till the moment of explosion when the process is repeated it may be said in favour of this type of engine that it is very simple and free from vibration; against it that owing to the imperfect scavenging of exploded charges it does not develop so much power as an ottocycle engine of equal cylinder dimensions; also that it is apt to overheat while it uses double the amount of electric current  motor boats for the navy a country which like england depends on the command of the sea for its very existence may well keep a sharp eye on any invention that tends to render that command more certain in recent years we have heard a lot said and read a lot written about the importance of swift boats which in war time could be launched against a hostile fleet armed with the deadly torpedo the russojapanese war has given us a fine example of what can be accomplished by daring men and swift torpedo craft for some reason or other the british navy has not kept abreast of france in the number of her torpedo vessels reference to official figures shows that while our neighbours can boast hornets we have to our credit only in the house of commons on august th mr henry norman mp asked the secretary of the admiralty whether in view of the proofs recently afforded of trustworthiness speed simplicity and comparatively low cost of small vessels propelled by petrol motors he would consider the advisability of testing this class of vessel in his majesty's navy the secretary replied that the admiralty had kept a watch on the recent trials and meant to make practical tests with motor pinnaces in view of the danger that would accompany the storage of petrol on board ship the paraffin motor was preferable for naval purposes; and an hp fourcylindered motor of this type has been ordered from messrs vosper of portsmouth mr norman writing in the world's work on the subject says there can be no question that such high speed and cheap construction hp giving in the little boat as much speedto consider that onlyas eight thousand in the big boat point to the use of motor boats for naval purposes in the near future a torpedo boat exists only to carry one or two torpedoes within launching distance of the enemy the smaller and cheaper she can be and the fewer men she carries provided always she be able to face a fairly rough sea the better now the ordinary steam torpedo boat carries perhaps twenty men and costs anything from £ to £ a motor boat of equal or greater speed could probably be built for £ and would carry a crew of two men six motor boats therefore could be built for the cost of one steamboat and their total crews would not number so many as the crew of the one moreover they could all be slung on board a single vessel and only set afloat near the scene of action a prophetic friend of mine declares that the most dangerous warship of the future will be a big vessel unarmoured and only lightly armed but of the utmost possible speed carrying twenty or more motor torpedo boats slung on davits she will rely on her greater speed for her own safety if attacked; she will approach as near the scene of action as possible and will drop all her little boats into the water and they will make a simultaneous attack their hulls would be clean their machinery in perfect order their crews fresh and full of energy and it would be strange if one of the twenty did not strike home and the destruction of a battleship or great cruiser at the cost of a score of these little wasps manned by twoscore men would be a very fine naval bargain mr norman omits one recommendation that must in active service count heavily in favour of the motor boat and that is its practical invisibility in the day or at night time the destroyer when travelling at high speed betrays its presence by clouds of smoke or redhot funnels the motor boat is entirely free from such dangerous accompaniments; the exhaust from the cylinders is invisible in every way the very absence of funnels must also be in itself a great advantage the eye roving over the waters might easily pick up a series of stumpy black objects of hard outline; but the motor boat riding low and flatly on the waves would probably escape notice especially when a searchlight alone can detect its approach it may reasonably be said that the admiralty knows its own business best and that the outsider's opinion is not wanted the man in the street has become notorious for his paper generalship and strategy and fallen somewhat into disrepute as an adviser on military and naval matters yet we must not forget this that manywe might say mostof the advances in naval mechanisms armour and weapons of defence have not been evolved by naval men but by the highly educated and ingenious civilian who unblinded by precedent or professional conservatism can watch the game even better in some respects than the players themselves and see what the next move should be that move may be rather unorthodoxlike the application of steam to meno'warbut none the less the correct one under the circumstances we allowed other nations to lead us in the matter of breechloading cannon armourplate submarines the abolition of combustible material on warships shall we also allow them to get ahead with motor boats and begin to consider that there may be something in motor auxiliaries for the fleet when they are already well supplied? if there is a country which should above all others lose no time in adding the motor to her means of defence that country is great britain footnote  the motor boat march th chapter ix the motor cycle  in the count de dion working in partnership with messrs bouton and trépardoux produced a practical steam tricycle two years later appeared a somewhat similar vehicle by the same makers which attained the remarkable speed of forty miles an hour mr serpollet now famous for his steam cars built at about the same time a threewheeled steam tricycle which also proved successful but the continuous stoking of the miniature boilers and the difficulty of keeping them properly supplied with water prevented the steamdriven cycle from becoming popular; and when the petrol motor had proved its value on heavy vehicles inventors soon saw that the explosion engine was very much better suited for a light automobile than had been the cumbrous fittings inseparable from the employment of steam by a neat petrol tricycle was on the market; and after the de dion machines had given proof in races of their capabilities they at once sprang into popular favour for the next five years the motor tricycle was a common sight in france where the excellent roads and the freedom from the restrictions prevailing on the other side of the channel recommended it to cyclists who wished for a more speedy method of locomotion than unaided legs could give yet could not afford to purchase a car the motor bicycle soon appeared in the field the earlier types of the twowheeled motor were naturally clumsy and inefficient the need of a lamp constantly burning to ignite the charges in the cylinder proved a much greater nuisance on the bicycle than on the tricycle which carried its driving gear behind the saddle the writer well remembers trying an early pattern of the werner motor bicycle in the champs elysées in and his alarm when the owner while starting the blowlamp on the steering pillar was suddenly enveloped in flames which played havoc with his hair and might easily have caused more serious injuries riders were naturally nervous at carrying a flame near the handlebars so close to a tank of inflammable petrol liable to leak and catch fire the advent of electrical ignition for the gaseous charges opened the way for great improvements and the motor bicycle slowly but surely ousted its heavier threewheeled rival designs were altered; the engine was placed in or below the frame instead of over the front wheel and made to drive the back wheel by means of a leather belt in the earliest types the motive force had either been transmitted by belt to the front wheel or directly to the rear wheel by the piston rods working cranks on its spindle the progress of the motor bicycle has since been rapid and many thousands of machines are now in use the fact that the engines must necessarily be very small compels all possible saving in weight and an ability to run continuously at very high speeds without showing serious wear and tear details have therefore been perfected and though at the present day no motor cyclist of wide experience can claim immunity from trouble with his speedy little mount a really welldesigned and wellbuilt machine proves wonderfully efficient and opens possibilities of locomotion to the man of moderate means which were beyond the reach of the rider of a pedaldriven bicycle in its way the motor cycle may claim to be one of the most marvellous products of human mechanical skill weight has been reduced until a power equal to that of three horses can be harnessed to a vehicle which when stored with sufficient petrol and electricity to carry it and rider miles scales about a hundredweight it will pursue its even course up and down hill at an average of twenty or more miles an hour the only attention it requires being an occasional charge of oil squirted into the airtight case in which the crank and flywheels revolve the consumption of fuel is ridiculously small since an economical engine will cover fifteen miles on a pint of spirit which costs about threehalfpence practically all motorcycle engines work on the ottocycle principle motors which give an impulse every revolution by compressing the charge in the crankcase or in a separate cylinder so that it may enter the working cylinder under pressure have been tried but hitherto with but moderate success there is however a growing tendency to compass an explosion every revolution by fitting two cylinders and from time to time fourcylindered cycles have appeared the disadvantages attending the care and adjustment of so many moving parts has been the cause of fourcylindered cycle motors being unsuccessful from a commercial standpoint though riders who are prepared to risk extra trouble and expense may find compensation in the quiet vibrationless drive of a motor which gives two impulses for every turn of the flywheel the acme of lightness in proportion to power developed has been attained by the barry engine in which the cylinders and their attachments are made to revolve about a fixed crank and perform themselves the function of a flywheel so great is the saving of weight that the makers claim a horsepower for every four pounds scaled by the engines; thus a hp motor would only just tip the beam against one stone as the writer has personally inspected a barry engine he is able to give a brief account of its action it has two cylinders arranged to face one another on opposite sides of a central airtight crankcase the inner end of each cylinder opening into the case both pistons advance towards and recede from the centre of the case simultaneously the airandgas mixture is admitted into the crankcase through a hole in the fixed crankspindle communicating with a pipe leading from the carburetter the inlet is controlled by a valve which opens while the pistons are parting and closes when they approach one another we will suppose that the engine is just starting the pistons are in a position nearest to the crankcase as they separate they draw a chargeequal in volume to double the cubical contents of one cylinderinto the crankcase through its inlet valve during the return stroke the charge is squeezed and passes through a valve into a chamber which forms as it were the fourth spoke of a fourspoked wheel of which the other three spokes are the cylinders and the silencer this chamber is connected by pipes to the inlet valves of the cylinders which are mechanically opened alternately by the action of special cams on the crankshaft the cylinder which gets the contents of the compression chamber receives considerably more mixture than would flow in under natural suction and the compression is therefore greater than in the ordinary type of cycle motor and the explosion more violent hence it comes about that the cylinders which have a bore of only in and a in stroke for the piston develop nearly hp each it may at first appear rather mysterious how if the cranks are rigidly attached to the cycle frame any motion can be imparted to the drivingwheel the explanation is simple enough a belt pulley is affixed to one side of the crankcase and revolves with the cylinders the silencer and compression chamber the rotation is caused by the effort of the piston to get as far as possible away from the closed end of the cylinder after an explosion where a crank is movable but the cylinder fixed the former would be turned round; where the crank is immovable but the cylinder movable the travel of the piston is possible only if the cylinder moves round the crank a series of explosions following one another in rapid succession gives the moving parts of the barry engine sufficient momentum to suck in charges compress them and eject the burnt gases the plan is ingenious and as the machine into which this type of engine is built weighs altogether only about lbs the sport of motor cycling is open to those people whose age or want of strength would preclude them from the use of the heavy mounts which are still to be seen about the roads in the future we may expect to find motor cycles approach very closely to a halfhundredweight standard without sacrificing the rigidity needful for fast locomotion over secondclass roads for pacemaking on racing tracks motor cycles ranging up to hp have been used; but these are essentially freak machines of no practical value for ordinary purposes even hp cycles have set up wonderful records exceeding fifty miles in the hour a speed equal to that of a good express train in comparison with the feats of motorcars their achievements may not appear very startling; but when we consider the small size and weight and the simplicity of the mechanisms which propel cycle and rider at nearly a mile a minute the result seems marvellous enough during the last few years the tricycle has again come into favour but with the arrangement of its wheels altered; two steeringwheels being placed in front and a single drivingwheel behind the main advantage of this inversion is that it permits the fixing of a seat in front of the driver in which a passenger can be comfortably accommodated the modern tricar with its highpowered doubledcylindered engines its changespeed gears its friction clutch for bringing the engines gradually into action its forced water circulation for cooling the cylinders and its springhung frame is in reality more a car than a cycle and escapes from the former category only on account of the number of its wheels to the tourist or to the person who does not find pleasure in solitary riding the tricar offers many advantages and though decidedly more expensive to keep up than a motor bicycle entails only very modest bills in comparison with those which affect many owners of cars the development of the motor cycle has been hastened and fostered by frequent speed and reliability contests in which the nimble little motor has acquitted itself wonderfully a hill a mile long with very steep gradients has been ascended in considerably less than two minutes by a hp motor we read of motor cycles travelling from land's end to johno'groats; from calcutta to bombay; from sydney to melbourne; from paris to romeall in phenomenal times considering the physical difficulties of the various routes such tests prove the endurance of the motor cycle and pave the way to its use in more profitable employments volunteer cycling corps often include a motor or two which in active service would be most valuable for scouting purposes especially if powerful enough to tow a light machinegun commercial travellers fitting a box to the front of a tricar are able to scour the country quickly and inexpensively in quest of orders for the firms they represent the police find the motor helpful for patrolling the roads on the continent and especially in germany town and country postmen collect and deliver parcels and letters with the aid of the petroldriven tricycle and thereby save much time while improving the service before long hark 'tis the twanging horn will once again herald the postman's approach in a thousand rural districts but the horn will not hang from the belt of a horseman such as the poet cowper describes but will be secured to the handlebars of a neat tricar thus history repeats itself illustration photo cribb southsea a motor lawnmower a machine of this kind will cut several acres a day and also acts as an efficient roller the operator is able to empty the contents of the catchbox without leaving his seat that the motor cycle is still far from perfect almost goes without saying; but every year sees a decided advance in its design and efficiency the messy troublesome accumulator will eventually give way to a neat little dynamo which is driven by the engine and creates current for exploding the cylinder charges as the machine travels when the cycle is at rest there would then be no fear of electricity leaking away through some secret short circuit since the current ceases with the need for it but starts again when its presence is required the proper cooling of the cylinders has been made an easier matter than formerly by the introduction of fans which direct a stream of cold air on to the cylinder head professor h l callendar has shown in a series of experiments that a fan which absorbs only to per cent of an engine's power will increase the engine's efficiency immensely when a low gear is being used for hill climbing and the rate of motion through the air has fallen below that requisite to carry off the surplus heat of the motor if an engine maintains a good working temperature when it progresses through space two feet for every explosion it would overheat if the amount of progression were through the medium of a changegear attachment reduced to one foot a change which would be advisable on a steep hill the fan then supplies the deficiency by imitating the natural rush of air as professor callendar says the most important point for the motor cyclist is to secure the maximum of power with the minimum of weight with this object the first essentials are a variable speed gear of wide range and some efficient method of cooling to prevent overheating at low gears it is unscientific to double the weight and power of the machine in order to climb a few hills when the same result can be secured with a variable gear it is unnecessary to resort to the weight and complication of water cooling when a light fan will do all that is required thus with the aid of a fan and a gear which will give at least two speeds the motor cyclist can with an engine of hp climb almost any hill even without resorting to the help of the pedals his motion is therefore practically continuous to be comfortable he desires immunity from the vibration which quick movement over any but firstclass roads sets up in the machine especially in its forward parts several successful spring forks and pneumatic devices have been invented to combat the vibration bogy; and these in conjunction with a spring pillar for the saddle which can itself be made most resilient relieve the rider almost entirely of the jolting which at the end of a long day's ride is apt to induce a feeling of exhaustion the motor tricycle which once had a rather bad name for its rough treatment of the nerves is also now furnished with springs to all wheels and approximates to the car in the smoothness of its progression assuming then that we have motor vehicles so light as to be very manageable sufficiently powerful to climb severe gradients reliable comfortable to ride and economical in their consumption of fuel and oil we are able to foresee that they will modify the conditions of social existence the ordinary pedaldriven cycle has made it possible for the worker to live much further from his work than formerly tomorrow with a motor bicycle his home may be fifteen miles away and those extra miles will make a great difference in rent and in the health of his family in fact it almost promises to reconcile the garden city ideal with the industrial conditions of today by enabling a man to work in the town and have his home in the country this advantage applies of course less to london than to other great cities on account of the seemingly endless miles of streets to be traversed before the country is reached in most manufacturing centres however the motoring workman could get to his cottage home by a journey of a few miles even in london moreover this disadvantage will be overcome to a large extent in the future for it is as certain as anything of the kind can be that we must ultimately have special highways smooth dustless reserved for motor traffic leading out of london in the principal directions my own conviction is that motor cycling the simplest the quickest the cheapest independent locomotion that has ever been known is destined to enjoy enormous development i believe that within a few years the motor bicycle and tricycle will be sold by hundreds of thousands and that many of the social and industrial conditions of our time will be greatly and beneficially affected by them footnote  henry norman esq mp in the world's work chapter x fire engines  a good motto to blazon over the doors of a firebrigade station would be he gives help twice who gives help quickly the spirit of it is certainly shown by the brave men who as soon as the warning signal comes spring to the engines and in a few minutes are careering at full speed to the scene of operations speed and smartness have for many years past been associated with our fire brigades we read how horses are always kept ready to be led to the engines; how their harness is dropped on to them and deft fingers set the buckles right in a twinkling so that almost before an onlooker has time to realise what is happening the sturdy animals are beating the ground with flying hoofs and few dwellers in large cities have not heard the cry of the firemen as it rises from an indistinct murmur into a loud shout before which the traffic however dense melts away to the side of the road and leaves a clear passage for the engines driven at high speed and yet with such skill that accidents are of rare occurrence the noise the gleam of the polished helmets the efforts of the noble animals which seem as keen as the men themselves to reach the fire combine to paint a scene which lingers long in the memory but efficient as the horsed engine is it has its limitations animal strength and endurance are not an indefinite quantity; while the fireman grudges even the few short moments which are occupied by the inspanning of the team in many towns therefore we find the mechanically propelled fire engine coming into favour the power for working the pumps is now given a second duty of turning the drivingwheels a parallel can be found in the steamengine used for threshingmachines which once had to be towed by horses but now travels of itself dragging machine and other vehicles behind it the earlier types of automobile fire engines used the boiler's steam to move them over the road liverpool a very enterprising city as regards the extinction of fire has for some time past owned a powerful steamer which can be turned out within a minute of the call can travel at any speed up to thirty miles an hour and can pump gallons per minute continuously its success has led to the purchase of other motor engines some fitted with a chemical apparatus which by the action of acid on a solution of soda in closed cylinders is enabled to fling water impregnated with carbonic acid gas on to the fire the moment it arrives within working distance of the conflagration and gives very valuable first aid while the pumping apparatus is being got into order illustration two motor fireengines built by messrs merryweather london that on the left is driven by petrol and in addition to pumpinggear carries a wheeled fireescape that on the right is driven by steam both types are much faster than horses being able to travel at a rate of over miles an hour as might reasonably be expected the petrol motor has found a fine field for its energies in connection with fire extinction since it occupies comparatively little space more accommodation can be allowed for the firemen and gear furthermore a petrol engine can be started in a few seconds by a turn of a handle whereas a steamer is delayed until steam has been generated messrs merryweather have built a fourcylindered hp petrol fire engine capable of a speed of forty miles an hour it has two systems of ignitionthe magneto or small dynamo and the ordinary accumulator and coilso that electrical breakdowns are not likely to occur a fast motor of this kind with a pumping capacity of gallons per minute is peculiarly suited for large country estates where it can be made to perform household or farm duties when not required for its primary purpose considering the great number of country mansions historically interesting and full of artistic treasures which england boasts it is a matter for regret that such an engine is not always included among the appliances with which every such property is furnished how often we read old mansion totally destroyed by fire which usually means that in a few short hours priceless pictures furniture and other objects of art have been destroyed because help when it did come arrived too late owners are however more keenly alive to their responsibilities now than formerly the small handworked engine or the hydrant of moderate pressure is not considered a sufficient guard for the house and its contents in many establishments the electric lighting engines are designed to work either the dynamo or a set of pumps as occasion may demand; or the motor is mounted on wheels so that it may be easily dragged by hand to any desired spot the latest thing in motor fire engines is one which carries a fireescape with it in addition to waterflinging machinery an engine of this type is to be found in some of the london suburbs a chemical cylinder lies under the driver's seat where it is well out of the way and coiled beside it is its reel of hose the escape rests on the top of the vehicle the wheels hanging over the rear end while the top projects some distance in front of the steering wheels the ladder of telescopic design can be extended to fifty feet as soon as it has been lowered to the ground since the saving of life is even more important than the saving of property it is very desirable that a means of escape should be at hand at the earliest possible moment after an outbreak this combination apparatus enables the brigade to nip a fire in the bud if it is still a comparatively small affair and also to rescue any people whose exit may have been cut off by the fire having started on or near the staircases the wolseley motorcar company has established a type of chemical motor fire engine which promises to be very successful a hp motor is placed forward under the frame to keep the centre of gravity low when fully laden it carries a crew of eight men two foot ladders two portable chemical extinguishers a gallon chemical cylinder and a reel on which is wound a hose fiftythree yards long the wheels are a combination of the wooden artillery and the wire spider wires being strung from the outer end of the hub to the outer ends of the wooden spokes to give them increased power to resist the strain of sudden turns or collisions an artillery wheel not thus reinforced is apt to buckle sideways and snap its spokes when twisted at all england has always led the way in matters relating to fire extinction and to her is due the credit of first harnessing mechanical motive power to the fire engine other countries are following her example and consequently we find fire apparatus moved by the petrol motor in places so far apart as cape town valparaiso mauritius sydney berlin new york montreal there can be no doubt but that in a very few years horsetraction will be abandoned by the brigades of our large towns it has been suggested that the firepump of the future will be driven by electricity drawn from switches on the street mains; enough current being stored in accumulators to move the pump from station to fire in such a case it would be possible to use very powerful pumps as an electric motor is extremely vigorous for its size and weight even today steam fire engines can fling gallons per minute and fire floats for use on the water considerably more possibly the engine of tomorrow will pour gallons a minute on the flames if it can get that amount from the water mains and so render it unnecessary to summon in a large number of engines to quell a big conflagration three hundred thousand gallons an hour ought to check a very considerable blaze the force with which a jet of water leaves the huge nozzle of a powerful engine is so great that it would seriously injure a spectator at a distance of fifty yards the kickback of the water on the nozzle is sometimes sufficient to overcome the power of one man to hold the nozzle in position with his hands and it becomes needful to provide supports with pointed ends to stick into the ground or hooks which can be attached to the rungs of a ladder for an attack on the upper storeys of a house a special water tower is much used in america it consists of a latticework iron frame about twentyfive feet long inside which slides an extensible iron tube five inches in diameter the tower is attached to one end of a wagon of unusual length and breadth and is raised to a vertical position by a rack gearing with a quadrant built into its base below the trunnions or pivots on which it swings carbonic acid gas generated in a cylinder carried on the wagon works a piston connected with the racks and on a tap being turned slowly brings the tower to the perpendicular when it is locked the telescopic tube carrying the hose inside it is then pulled up by windlasses until the inch nozzle is nearly fifty feet from the ground the nozzle itself can be rotated from below by rods and gearing and the angle of the stream regulated by a rope if several engines simultaneously deliver their water to the tower hoses gallons a minute can be concentrated in a continuous inch jet on to the fire the ordinary horsed fire engine is simple in its design and parts the vertical boiler contains a number of nearly horizontal water tubes which offer a great surface to the furnace gases so that it may raise steam very quickly the actual water capacity of the boiler is small and therefore it must be fed continuously by a special pump the pumps two or three in number usually have piston rods working direct from the steam cylinders on the plungers of the pumps between cylinders and pumps are slots in the rods in which rotate cranks connected with one another and with a flywheel which helps to keep the running steady after leaving the pumps the water enters a large air vessel which reduces the sudden shocks of delivery by the cushioning effect of the air and causes a steady pressure on the water in the hoses chapter xi firealarms and automatic fire extinguishers  assuming that a town has a wellappointed fire brigade equipped with the most uptodate engines it still cannot be considered efficiently protected against the ravages of the firefiend unless the outbreak of a fire can be notified immediately to the stations and local mechanical means of suppression come into action almost simultaneously with the commencement of the conflagration what you do do quickly is the keynote of successful firesuppression; and its importance has been practically recognised in the invention of hundreds of devices some of which we will glance at in the following pages the electric circuit is the most valuable servant that we have to warn us of danger dotted about the streets are posts carrying at the top a circular box which contains a knob as soon as a fire is observed anyone may run to such a post smash the glass screening the knob and pull out the latter this action flashes the alarm to the nearest firestation and a few minutes later an engine is dashing to the rescue help may also be summoned by means of the ordinary telephone exchanges or from policestations in direct telephonic communication with the brigade depôts all devices depending for their ultimate value on human initiative leave a good deal to be desired they presuppose conditions which may be absent for instance an electric wire in a large factory ignites some combustible material during the night a passerby may happen to see flames while the fire is in an early stage on the other hand it is equally probable that the conflagration may be well established before the alarm is given with the result that the fire brigade arrives too late to do much good what we need therefore is a mechanical means of calling attention to the danger automatically with a quickness which will give the brigade or people close at hand a chance of strangling the monster almost as soon as it is born and with a precision as to locality that will save the precious time wasted in hunting for the exact point to be attacked mr g h oatway miee in a valuable paper read before the international congress of fire brigades in london in says that the difference between the damage resulting from a fire signalled in its early stage and the same fire reported when it has spread to two or three floors is often the difference between a nominal loss and a burn out the reformer he continues who aims at reducing fire waste must turn his attention primarily to hastening the alarm the true cure of the matter is not what quantity of gear it takes to deal with huge conflagrations but how to concentrate at the earliest stage upon the outbreaks as they occur and to check them before they have grown beyond control he cites the fire record of glasgow of from which it appears that three fires alone accounted for per cent of the year's total loss ten fires for per cent and the other for only per cent or an average of £ per fire had the first three fires only been notified at an earlier stage nearly £ would have been saved captain sir e m shaw late chief of the london fire brigade has put the following on record having devoted a very large portion of the active period of my working life in bringing into general use mechanical and hydraulic appliances for dealing with fires after they have been discovered i nevertheless give and have always given the highest place to the early discovery and indication of fire and not by any means to the steam the hydraulic or the numerous other mechanical appliances on which the principal labours of my life have been bestowed a fire given fifteen minutes' start is often hard to overtake imagine a warehouse alight on three floors before the alarm is raised! engines may come one after another and pour deluges of water on the flames yet as likely as not we read next morning of total destruction no stitch in time has saved nine! the sad part about fires is that they represent so much absolute waste in commercial transactions if one party loses the other gains; wealth is merely transferred and still remains in the community but in the matter of fire this is not the case supposing that a huge cotton mill is burnt down the reerection will it is true cause a lot of money to change hands; but what has resulted from the money that has already been put into the mill? nothing so many hundred thousands of pounds have been dematerialised and left nothing behind to represent them the great ottawa fire of a few years ago may be remembered as a terrible example of such total loss of human effort  the history of firealarms the first recorded specification for an automatic detecting device bears the date in that year a mr john greene patented an arrangement of cords weights and pulleys which when the cord burnt through caused the movement of an indicating semaphore arm as this action appealed only to the eye it might easily pass unnoticed and we can imagine that mr greene did not find a gold mine in his invention twentyfour years later an advance was made when william stedman introduced a philosophical fire alarum his apparatus consisted of a pivoted bulb having an open neck and containing mercury spirit or other liquid as the heat of the room increased the expansion of the fluid caused it to spill over release a trigger and allow a mechanical gong to run down this arrangement whilst an advance upon the first referred to is quite impracticable evaporation of fluid expansion of mercury a stiff crank or other causes which will readily occur to you and the thing is useless in an automatic method for sprinkling water over a fire appeared the idea was simplicity itself a network of water mains with taps controlled by cords which burnt through and turned on the water william congreve patented three years later a sprinkler which was an improvement in that it indicated the position of the fire in a building by dropping one of a number of weights but string is not to be relied upon it may perish and break when no fire is about and any system of extinction depending on it might prove a doubleedged weapon the nineteenth century produced hundreds of devices for alarming and extinguishing automatically all depended upon the principle of the expansion or melting of metal in the increased temperature arising from a fire at one time the circuitclosing thermometer was popular on account of its simplicity its drawback says mr oatway is the smallness of its heatcollecting surface its isolation and last and worst of all its fixity of operation in thermometer or fusealarm practice it is usual to place the detectors at intervals of about ten feet or so so that a room of any size will contain a number if a fire breaks out the ceiling is blanketed with heat and every detector feels its influence each is affected but none can give the alarm until some one of the number absolutely reaches the set point or melts out having no means of varying the composition of the solder or shifting the wire an actuating point must be selected which is high enough to give a good working margin over the maximum industrial or seasonal heat of the year; and thus it comes about that if the fire breaks out in winter or when the room is at its lowest temperature the amount of loss is considerably and quite unnecessarily increased in a device set to fuse at ° fahrenheit it will be clear to every one that the measure of the damage will depend upon the normal temperature of the room at the time of the outbreak if the mercury is in the nineties there is only some sixty degrees of a rise to wait for; whilst if it happens to be a winter's night the alarm is held back for a rise of perhaps ° what chance is there in this case for a good stop? mr oatway has examined the fuses under different conditions and his conclusions are drawn from practical tests great intelligence will not be required to appreciate the force of his arguments inasmuch as the rise of temperature caused by a fire is relative during the early stages at least to the general heat of the atmosphere it becomes obvious that an automatic firealarm should be one which will keep parallel as it were with fluctuations of natural heat thus if the danger rise be fixed at ° the alarm should be given on a cold night as certainly as at midday in summer it was the failure of early patterns in this respect that led to their being discredited by the firebrigade authorities the writer already quoted has laid down the functions of a perfect alarm a to detect the fire at a uniformly early period under all atmospheric and industrial conditions b to give the alarm upon the premises and simultaneously to the brigade by a definite and unmistakable message c to facilitate the work of extinction by indicating the position of the outbreak in the building attacked the may oatway alarm has got round the first difficulty in a most ingenious manner by adapting the principle of the compensation methods already described in connection with watches the alarm consists of a steel rod of a section found to be most suitable for the purpose to the side is attached by screws entering the rod near the ends a copper wire which is long enough to sag slightly at its centre from which depends a silver chain carrying a carbon contactpiece a short distance below the carbon are the two terminals of the electric circuit which when completed by the lowering of the carbon gives the alarm now if there be a very gradual change of temperature the steel rod lengthens slowly and so does the copper wire so that the amount of sag remains practically what it was before but in event of a fire the copper expands much more quickly than the steel and sags until the carbon completes the circuit the whole thing is beautifully simple very durable quite consistent and reliable as soon as the temperature diminishes on the extinction of the fire the alarm automatically returns to its normal position ready for further work now for the second function that of giving the alarm in many places at once the closed circuit does not itself directly cause bells to ring it works a relay that is a second and more powerful circuit in fact it is the counterpart of the engine driver who does not himself make the locomotive move but merely turns on the steam an installation has been introduced in the poplar workhouseto quote an instance were a fire to break out one of the detectors would soon set twentyfive bells in action one in each officer's room similarly in the warehousemen's orphanage at cheadle hulme every dormitory would be aroused and every officer including the principal in his house some distance away messrs arthur and company of glasgow have a warehouse fortified with of these nerve centres all yoked to four position indicators three of which actuate a master indicator connected with the central firestation there is no hole or corner in this huge establishment where the firedemon could essay his fell work without being at once spied upon by a detector we may glance for a moment at the mechanism which sends an unmistakable message for help at the brigade station there is a number of small tablets each protected by a flap on the outside of which is the word safe on the inside fire normally the flap is closed as soon as the circuit is completed a magnet releases the flap and a bell begins to ring now it is possible that the circuit might be closed accidentally by contact somewhere between the premises it serves and the firestation so that the official on guard seeing j brown and company on the uncovered tablet might despatch the engines to the place indicated on a wildgoose chase to prevent such false alarms the transmitter not only rings the station up but automatically sends an unmistakable message when a fire occurs an automatic printing machine is set in motion to despatch a cipher in the morse code four times to the station an accidental circuit could not do this; therefore when the officer sees on the receiving tape the wellknown cipher he turns out his men with all speed on arriving at their destination the firemen receive valuable help from the position indicator which guides them to their work on a special board is seen a row or rows of shutters similar to those already mentioned each row belongs to a floor; each unit of the row to a room a glance suffices to tell that the trouble is say in the most southerly room of the second floor no notice is therefore taken of smoke rolling out of other parts of the building until the danger spot has been attacked that the firemen appreciate such an ally goes without saying every fire extinguished is a point to their credit also the risks they run are greatly diminished while the wear and tear of tackle is proportionately reduced the fireman is noted for his courage and unflinching performance of duty the discomforts of his profession are sometimes severe and its dangers as certain as they are at times appalling therefore we welcome any mechanical method which at once shortens his work lessens his peril and protects property from damage mr oatway draws special attention to the need for simultaneous warning on the premises and at the firestation i remember he says many cases but perhaps no better illustration need be looked for than the case of a cotton mill in lancashire about two years ago the fire was seen to start at a few minutes past seven; a fuse blew out and sparked some cotton; but it looked such a simple job that the operatives elected to deal with it at twenty minutes to eight it dawned upon somebody that the brigade had better be sent for because the fire was getting away; and in due course they arrived; but the mill already doomed became a total loss in every centre similar instances can be quoted there is nothing in any automatic system to discourage individual effort inmates can put the fire out if able; but in any case the brigade gets timely and definite notice and if on their arrival they find the fire extinguished as chief superintendent thomas put it when we opened the dingle station after the fatal trainburning 'so much the better we shall get to our beds all the quicker' this is the commonsense view of it helpers work none the less intelligently because they know the brigade is coming; and it is necessary to provide some automatic method of calling them because you can never rely upon anybody who is unfamiliar with fire doing the right thing at the proper time messrs may and oatway who give their name to the alarm described above first introduced their apparatus in new zealand from which country it has spread over the british empire the largest installation is at messrs clark and company's anchor mills paisley the whole of the immense block of buildings the greater part of which was previously protected by sprinklers only is now electrically protected also; and connected up with the fire brigade and through their station with the sleeping quarters of every fireman some figures will be interesting here there are miles of internal alarm circuits; miles of underground cable between buildings; automatic telegraphs; automatic position indicators; alarm gongs a foot in diameter early in january a fire broke out in these buildings during the dinner hour when most of the works' firemen were at their midday meal the alarm sounded simultaneously at the works' firestation and at the firemen's houses which are situated on the other side of the street from the mill the firemen were on the spot immediately and were enabled to subdue the flames which had broken out in the building occupied as warehouse and office before it had got a firm hold of the inflammable material although not before one of the large stacks of finished thread was ablaze the brigade however were soon masters of the situation and the damage done was under £ there is little doubt had the alarm been left to the ordinary course the building would have been totally destroyed in those few minutes the installation saved its entire cost many times over truly a little fire is quickly trodden out which being suffered rivers cannot quench here in a shakespearean nutshell is the whole science of fire protection  automatic sprinklers as these have been referred to several times a short description may appropriately be given the building which they protect is fitted with a network of mains and branches ramifying into each room at the end of each branch is a nozzle the mouth of which is bridged over by a metal arch carrying a small plate between the bridge and a glass plug closing the nozzle is a bar of easily fusible solder when the temperature has risen to danger point the solder melts and the plug is driven out by the water which strikes the plate and scatters in all directions this device has proved very valuable on many occasions the encyclopædia britannica tenth edition states that in the record of the american associated factory mutual companies for the years ending january  it appears that out of fires where sprinklers came into play were extinguished by one jet; by two jets; by three; by four; by five the firebucket is the simplest device we have as a first aid; and very effective it often proves insurance statistics show that more fires are put out by pails than by all other appliances put together the important point to be remembered in connection with them is that they should always be kept full; so that at the critical moment there may be no hurried rushing about to find the two gallons of liquid which each is supposed to contain permanently in cassier's magazine vol xx p is given an account of the manner in which an ingenious mill superintendent ensured the pails on the premises being ready for duty the hooks carrying the pails were fitted up with pieces of spring steel strong enough to lift the pail when nearly empty but not sufficiently so to lift a full pail just over each spring in such a position as to be out of the way of the handle of the pail was set a metal point connected with a wire from an opencircuit battery so long as the pails were full their weight when hung on their hooks kept the springs down but as soon as one was removed or lost a considerable part of its contents by evaporation or otherwise the spring on its hook would rise come into contact with the metal point thus close the battery circuit and ring a bell in the manager's office at the same time showing which was the bucket at fault the bell continued to ring till the deficiency had been made right; and by this simple contrivance the buckets were protected from misuse or lack of attention footnotes  mr w h oatway  glasgow evening news chapter xii the machinery of a ship the reversing enginemarine

the apparatus referred to either works so unobtrusively or is so sequestered from the public eye that one might travel for weeks without even hearing mention of it on a warship the amount of machinery is vastly increased in fact every war vessel from the firstclass battleship to the smallest destroyer is practically a congeries of machines; accommodation for human beings taking a very secondary place big guns must be trained fed and cleaned by machinery; and these processes simple as they sound need most elaborate devices the difference in respect of mechanism between the king edward vii and

vessels illustration photo cribb southsea a gigantic sheerlegs used for lowering boilers big guns turrets etc into menofwar the legs rise to a height of feet and will handle weights up to tons during the last twenty years marine engines have been enormously improved but the advance of auxiliary appliances has been even more marked in earlier times the matter considered of primary importance was the propulsion of the vessel; and engineers turned their attention to the problem of crowding the greatest possible amount of power into the least possible amount of space this was effected mainly by the compounding of enginesusing the steam over and over again in cylinders of increasing sizeand by improving the design of boilers as soon as this business had been well forwarded auxiliary machinery which though not absolutely necessary for movement greatly affected the ease comfort and economy of working a ship got its share of notice with the result that a tour round the works of a modern battleship or liner is a growing wonder and a liberal education in itself this chapter will deal with the auxiliaries to be found in large vessels designed for peaceful or warlike uses many devices are common to ships of both classes and some are confined to one type only though the steel wall certainly has the advantage with regard to multiplicity we may begin with  the reversing engine all marine engines should be fitted with some apparatus which enables the engineer to reverse them from full speed ahead to full speed astern in a few seconds the effort required to perform the operation of shifting over the valves is such as to necessitate the help of steam therefore you will find a special device in the engineroom which when the engineer moves a small lever either way from the normal position lets steam into a cylinder and moves rods reversing the main engine by a link action which could not be explained without a special diagram the valves of the auxiliary are closed automatically as soon as the task has been performed; so that there is no constant pressure on the one or the other side of its piston to prevent the reversal being too sudden the auxiliary's pistonrod is prolonged and fitted to a second piston working in a second cylinder full of glycerine or oil this piston is pierced with a small hole through which the incompressible liquid passes as the piston moves since its passage is gradual the engines are reversed deliberately enough to protect their valves from any severe strains these reversing engines can if the steam serving them fails be worked by hand  marine engine speed governors when a ship is passing through a strong sea and pitches as she crosses the waves the screw is from time to time lifted clear of the water and the engines which a moment before had been doing their utmost suddenly find their load taken off them the result is racing of the machinery which makes itself very unpleasantly felt from one end of the ship to the other then the screw revolving at a speed much above the normal suddenly plunges into the water again and encounters great resistance to its revolution a series of changes from full to no load as engineers term it must be harmful to any engines even though the evil effects are not shown at once great strains are set up which shake bolts loose or may crack the heavy standards in which the cranks and shaft work and even seriously tax the shaft itself and the screw on land every stationary engine set to do tasks in which the load varieswhich practically means all stationary enginesare fitted with a governor to cut off the steam directly a certain rate of revolution is exceeded these engines are the more easily governed because they carry heavy flywheels which pick up or lose their velocity gradually a marine engine on the other hand has only the screw to steady it and this is extremely light in proportion to the power which drives it; in fact has scarcely any controlling influence at all as soon as it leaves the water marine engineers therefore need some mechanical means of restraining their engines from running away the device must be very sensitive and quick acting since the engines would increase their rate threefold in a second if left ungoverned when running free; while on the other hand it must not throttle the steam supply a moment after the work has begun again when the screw takes the water many mechanisms have been invented to curb the marine engine some have proved fairly successful others practically useless; and the fact remains that owing to the greater difficulty of the task marine governing is not so delicate as that of land engines a great number of steamships are not fitted with governors for the simple reason that the engineers are sceptical about such devices as a class and would rather not be bothered with them but whatever may have been its record in the past the marine governor is at the present time sufficiently developed to form an item in the enginerooms of many of our largest ships we select as one of the best devices yet produced that known as andrews' patent governor; and append a short description it consists of two main partsthe pumps and the ram closing the throttle the pumps two in number are worked alternately by some moving part of the engine such as the airpump lever they inject water through a small pipe into a cylinder the pistonrod of which operates a throttle valve in the main steam supply to the engines at the bottom of this cylinder is a bypass or artificial leak through which the water flows back to the pumps the size of the flow through the bypass is controlled by a screw adjustment we will suppose that the governor is set to permit one hundred revolutions a minute as long as that rate is not exceeded the bypass will let out as much water as the pumps can inject into the cylinder and the piston is not moved but as soon as the engines begin to race the pumps send in an excess and the piston immediately begins to rise closing the throttle as the speed falls the leak gets the upper hand again and the piston is pushed down by a powerful spring opening the throttle it might be supposed that when the screw races the pumps would not only close the throttle but also press so hard on it as to cause damage to some part of the apparatus before the speed had fallen again this is prevented by the presence of a second control valve or leak worked by a connectingrod rising along with the pistonrod of the ram the two rods are held in engagement by a powerful spring which presses them together so that a hollow in the first engages with a projection on the second immediately the pressure increases and the piston rises the second valve is shut by the lifting of its rod and so farther augments the pressure in the cylinder and quickens the closing of the throttle valve this pressure increase must however be checked or the piston would overrun and stop the engines so when the piston has nearly finished its stroke the connectingrod comes into contact with a stop which disengages it from the pistonrod and allows the second control valve to be fully opened by the spring pulling on its rod the piston at once sinks to such a position as the pressure allows and the action is repeated time after time the governing is practically instantaneous though without shock and is said to keep the engine within per cent of the normal rate that is if be the proper number of revolutions it would not be allowed to exceed or drop below such governing is in technical language very close the idea is very ingenious pumps working against a leak and as soon as they have mastered it being aided by a secondary valve which reduces the size of the leak so as to render the effect of the pumps increasingly rapid until the throttle has been closed then the secondary valve is suddenly thrown out of action gives the leak full play and causes the throttle to open quickly so that the steam may be cut off only for a moment by the turning of a small milled screwhead a couple of inches in diameter the pace of hp engines is as fully regulated as if a powerful brake were applied the moment they exceeded the legal limit  steering engines the uninitiated may think that the man on the bridge revolving a spokedwheel with apparently small exertion is directly moving the rudder to port or to starboard as he wishes but the helm of a large vessel travelling at high speed could not be so easily deflected were not some giant at work down below in obedience to the easy motions of the wheel sometimes in a special little cabin on deck but more often in the engineroom where it can be tended by the staff there is the steering engine usually worked by steampower two little cylinders turn a wormscrew which revolves a wormwheel and a train of cogs the last of which moves to right or left a quadrant attached to the chains or cables which work the rudder all that the steersman has to do with his wheel is to put the engine in forward backward or middle gear the steam being admitted to the cylinders quickly moves the helm to the position required a particularly ingenious steam gear is that made by messrs harfield and company of london its chief feature is the arrangement whereby the power to move the rudder into any position remains constant if you have ever steered a boat you will remember that when a sudden curve must be made you have to put far more strength into the tiller than would suffice for a slight change of direction now if a steamengine and gear were so built as to give sufficient pressure on the helm in all positions it would if powerful enough to put the ship hardaport evidently be overpowered for the gentler movements and would waste steam the harfield gear has the last of the cogtrainthe one which engages with the rack operating the tillermounted eccentrically the rack itself is not part of a circle but almost flat centrally and sharply bent at the ends in short the curve is such that the rack teeth engage with the eccentric cog at all points of the latter's revolution when the helm is normal the longest radius of the eccentric is turned towards the rack in this position it exerts least power; but least power is then needed as the helm goes over the radius of the cogs gradually decreases and its leverage proportionately increases so that the engine is taxed uniformly all the time some war vessels including the illfated russian cruiser variag have been fitted with electric steering gear operated by a motor in which the direction of the current can be varied at the will of the helmsman all power gears are so arranged that in case of a breakdown of the power a handwheel can be quickly brought into play  blowing and ventilating apparatus a railway locomotive sends the exhaust steam up the funnel with sufficient force to expel all air from the same and to create a vacuum the only passage for the air flying to fill this empty space lies through the firebox and tubes traversing the boiler from end to end were it not for the induced draughtthe invention of george stephensonno locomotive would be able to draw a train at a higher speed than a few miles an hour on shipboard the fresh water used in the boilers is far too precious to be wasted by using it as a fireexciter salt water to make good the loss would soon corrode the boilers and cause terrible explosions therefore the necessary draught is created by forcing air through the furnaces instead of by drawing it the stokehold is entirely separated from the outer air except for the ventilators down which air is forced by centrifugal pumps at considerable pressure this draught serves two purposes it lowers the temperature of the stokehold which otherwise would be unbearable and also feeds the fires with plenty of oxygen the air forced in can escape in one way only viz by passing through the furnaces when the ship is slowed down the forced draught is turned off and then you see the poor stokers coming up for a breath of fresh air in the red sea or other tropical latitudes these grimy but useful men have a very hard time of it while passengers up above are grumbling at the heat the stoker below is almost fainting although clad in nothing but the thinnest of trousers in the engineroom also things at times become uncomfortably warm take the case of the united states monitor amphitrite which went into commission in for a trial run both stokehold and engineroom were very insufficiently ventilated the vessel started from hampton roads for brunswick georgia the trip of about miles occupied five days in the latter part of july and for sheer suffering has perhaps seldom been equalled in our naval history the fireroom stokehold temperature was never below ° and often above ° while the engineroom ranged closely about ° for the first twentyfour hours the men stood it well but on the second day seven succumbed to the heat and were put on the sick list one of them nearly dying; before the voyage was ended twentyeight had been driven to seek medical attendance the gaps thus created were partially filled with inexperienced men from the deck force until there was only a lifeboat's crew left in each watch on the evening of the fourth day out our men had literally fought the fire to a finish and had been vanquished; the watch on duty broke down one by one and the engines after lumbering along slower and slower actually stopped for want of steam at daybreak the next morning we got under way and steamed at a very conservative rate to our destination fortunately only about ten miles distant the scene in the fireroom that morning was not of this earth and far beyond description the heat was almost destructive to life; steam was blowing from many defective joints and water columns; tools ladders doors and all fittings were too hot to touch; and the place was dense with smoke escaping from furnace doors for there was absolutely no draught the men collected to build up the fires were the best of those remaining fit for duty but they were worn out physically were nervous apprehensive and dispirited rough irish firemen who would stand in a fair fight till killed in their tracks were crying like children and begging to be allowed to go on deck so completely were they unmanned by the cruel ordeal they had endured so long 'hell afloat' is a nautical figure of speech often idly used but then we saw it for a month thereafter the ship was actively employed on the southern coast drilling militia at different ports and sweltering in the new dock at port royal one trip of twentynine hours broke the record for heat the fireroom being frequently above ° all fireroom temperatures were taken in the actual spaces where the men had to work and not from hot corners or overhead pockets the ventilators were subsequently altered and the men enjoyed comparative comfort the words quoted will suffice to establish the importance of a proper current of air where men have to work one of the greatest difficulties encountered in deep mining is that while the temperature approaches and sometimes passes that of a stokehold the task of sending down a cool current from above is with depths of ft and over a very awkward one to carry out on passenger ships the fans ventilating the cabins and saloons are constantly at work either sucking out foul air or driving in fresh the principle of the fan is very similar to that of the centrifugal water pumpvanes rotating in a case open at the centre through which the air enters to be flung by the blades against the sides of the case and driven out of an opening in its circumference sometimes an ordinary screwshaped fan such as we often see in public buildings is employed  pumps every steamship carries several varieties of pump first there are the large pumps generally of a simple type for emptying the bilge or any compartment of the ship which may have sprung a leak all hands to the pumps! is now seldom heard on a steamer for the opening of a steamcock sets machinery in motion which will successfully fight any but a very severe breach it is needless to say that these pumps form a very important part of a ship's equipment without which many a fine vessel would have sunk which has struggled to land the pumps for the condensers form another class these are centrifugal force pumps; their duty is to circulate cold seawater round the nests of tubes through which steam flows after passing through the cylinders it is thus converted once more into water ready for use again in the boiler every atom of the water is evaporated condensed and pumped back into the boiler once in a period ranging from fifteen minutes to an hour according to the type of boiler and the size of the supply tanks some condensers have the cooling water passed through the tubes and the steam circulated round these in an airtight chamber in any case the condenser should be so designed as to offer a large amount of cold surface to the hot vapour a breakdown of the condenser pumps is a serious mishap since steam would then be wasted which represents so much fresh waterhard to replace in the open sea it would be comparable to the disarrangement of the circulating pump on a motorcar though the effects are different we must not forget the feedpumps for the boilers on their efficient action depends the safety of the ship and her passengers water must be maintained at a certain level in the boiler so that all tube and other surfaces in direct contact with the furnace gases may be covered the disastrous explosions we sometimes hear of are often caused by the failure of a pump the burning of a tube or plate and the inevitable collapse of the same the firms of weir and worthington are among the bestknown makers of the special highpressure pumps used for throwing large quantities of water into the boilers of mercantile and war vessels  feed heaters as the fuel supply of a vessel cannot easily be replenished on the high seas economy in coal consumption is very desirable if you put a cold spoon into a boiling saucepan ebullition is checked at once though only for a moment while the spoon takes in the temperature of the water similarly if cold water be fed into a boiler the steam pressure at once falls therefore the hotter the feed water is the better the feed heater is the reverse of the condenser in the latter cold water is used to cool hot steam; in the former hot steam to heat cold water there are many patterns of heaters one type largely used sprays the cold water through a valve into a chamber through which steam is passed from the engines the spray falling through the hot vapour partially condenses it and takes up some of its heat the surplus steam travels on to the condensers a float in the lower part of the chamber governs a valve admitting steam to the boiler pumps so that as soon as a certain amount of water has accumulated the pumps are started and the hot liquid is forced into the boiler another type the hampson feeder sends steam through pipes of a wavy form surrounded by the feed water there being no actual contact between liquid and vapour an ally of the heater is the  feedwater filter which removes suspended matter which if it entered the boiler would form a deposit round the tubes and while decreasing their efficiency make them more liable to burning the most dangerous element caught by the filters is fatty matteroil which has entered the cylinders and been carried off by the exhaust steam the filter is either high pressure ie situated between the pump and the boiler; or low pressure ie between the pump and the reservoir from which it draws its water the second class must have large areas so as not to throttle the supply unduly many kinds of filtering media have been triedfabrics of silk calico cocoanut fibre towelling sawdust cork dust charcoal coke; but the ideal substance at once cheap easily obtainable durable and completely effective yet remains to be found a filter should be so constructed that the filtering substance is very accessible for cleansing or renewal  distillers we now come to a part of a ship's plant very necessary for both machines and human beings many a time have people been in the position of the ancient mariner who exclaimed water water everywhere but not a drop to drink! water is so weighty that a ship cannot carry more than a very limited quantity and that for the immediate needs of her passengers the boilers in spite of their condensers waste a good deal of steam at safety valves through leaking joints and packings and in other ways this loss must be made good for as already remarked salt water spells the speedy ruin of any boiler it enters the distiller in its simplest form combines a boiler for changing water into vapour with a condenser for reconverting it to liquid solids in impure water do not pass off with the steam so that the latter if condensed in clean vessels is fit for drinking or for use in the engine boilers a pound of steam will under this system give a pound of water but as such procedure would be extravagant of fuel compound condensers are used which act in the following manner highpressure steam is passed from the engine boilers into the tubes of an evaporator and converts the salt water surrounding it into steam the boiler steam then travels into its own condenser or into the feed water heater while the steam it generated passes into the coils of a second evaporator converts water there into steam and itself goes to a condenser the steam generated in the second evaporator does similar duty in a third evaporator so that one pound of highpressure steam is directly reconverted to water and also indirectly produces between two and three pounds of fresh water the condensers used are similar to those already described in connection with the engines and need no further comment about the evaporators it may be said that they are so constructed that they can be cleaned out easily as soon as the accumulation of salt and other matter renders the operation necessary usually one side is hinged and provided with a number of bolts all round the edges which are quickly removed and replaced the united states navy includes a ship the iris whose sole duty is to supply the fleet she attends with plenty of fresh water she was built in by messrs r and w hawthorn of newcastleontyne and measures feet in length feet beam for her size she has remarkable bunker capacity and can accommodate nearly tons of coal fore and aft are huge storage tanks to hold between them about gallons of fresh water her stills can produce a maximum of gallons a day it has been reckoned that each ton of water distilled costs only cents; or stated otherwise that gallons cost one penny at many ports fresh water costs three or four times this figure; and even when procured is of doubtful purity during the spanishamerican war the iris and a sister ship the rainbow proved most useful  refrigerators of late years the frozenmeat trade has increased by leaps and bounds australia new zealand argentina canada and the united states send millions of pounds' worth of mutton and beef across the water every year to help feed the populations of england and europe in past times the live animals were sent to be either killed when disembarked or fatted up for the market this practice was expensive and attended by much suffering of the unfortunate creatures if bad weather knocked the vessel about refrigerating machinery has altered the traffic most fundamentally not only can more meat be sent at lower rates but the variety is increased; and many other substances than flesh are often found in the cold stores of a shipbutter and fruit being important items certain steamship lines such as the shaw savill and albionplying between england and australasiainclude vessels specially built for the transport of vast numbers of carcases upwards of a million carcases have been packed into the hull of a single ship and kept perfectly fresh during the long six weeks' voyage across the equator every passengercarrying steamer is provided with refrigerating rooms for the storage of perishable provisions; and as the comfort of the passengers not to say their luxury is bound up with these compartments it will be interesting to glance at the method employed for creating local frost amid surrounding heat the big principle underlying the refrigerator is thisthat a liquid when turned into gas absorbs heat thus to convert water into steam you must feed it with heat from a fire and that as soon as the gas loses a certain amount of its heat it reverts to liquid form now take ammonia gas the spirits of hartshorn we buy at the chemist's is water impregnated with this gas at ordinary living temperatures the water gives out the gas as a sniff at the bottle proves in a most effective manner if this gas were cooled to ·° below zero it would assume a liquid state ie that temperature marks its boiling point similarly steam cooled to ° fahr becomes water boiling point therefore merely means the temperature at which the change occurs ammonia liquid when gasifying absorbs a great amount of heat from its surroundingsair water or whatever they may be so that if we put a tumbler full of the liquid into a basin of water it would rob the water of enough heat to cause the formation of ice the refrigerating machine generally employed on ships is one which constantly turns the ammonia liquid into gas and the gas back into liquid the first process produces the cold used in the freezingrooms the apparatus consists of three main parts  the compressor for squeezing ammonia gas  the condenser for liquefying the gas  the evaporator for gasifying the liquid the compressor is a pump the condenser a tube or series of tubes outside which cold water is circulated the evaporator a spiral tube or tubes passing through a vessel full of brine between the condenser and evaporator is a valve which allows the liquid to pass from the one to the other in proper quantities we can now watch the cycle of operations the compressor sucks in a charge of very cold gas from the evaporator and squeezes it into a fraction of its original volume thereby heating it the heated gas now passes into the condenser coils and as it expands encounters the chilling effects of the water circulating outside which robs it of heat and causes it to liquefy it is next slowly admitted through the expansion valve into the evaporator here it gradually picks up the heat necessary for its gaseous form taking it from the brine outside the coils which has a very low freezingpoint the brine is circulated by pumps through pipes lining the walls of the freezingroom and robs the air there of its heat until a temperature somewhat below the freezingpoint of water is reached the room is well protected by layers of charcoal or silicate cotton which are very bad conductors of heat how the chamber strikes a novice can be gathered from the following description of a cunard liner's refrigerating room it is a curious and interesting sight it may be a hot day on deck nearing new york and everyone is going about in sun hats and light clothes we descend a couple of flights of stairs turn a key and here is winter sparkling in glassy frost upon the pale carcases of fowls and game and ruddy joints of meat crystallising the yellow apples and black grapes to the likeness of sweetmeats in a grocer's shop gathering on the wallpipes in scintillating coats of snow nearly an inch deep you can make a snowball down here if you like and carry it up on deck to astonish the languid loungers sheltering from the sun under the protection of the promenadedeck roof such is the modern substitute for the oldtime saltbeef cask and bags of dried pease! the larder is so near the kitchen that while below decks we may just peep into the kitchens where a whitecapped chef presides over an army of assistants inside a huge oven are dozens of joints turning round and round by the agency of an invisible electricmotor but what most tickles the imagination is an electrical eggboiling apparatus which ensures the correct amount of cooking to any egg a row of metal dippers with perforated bottoms is suspended over a trough of boiling water each dipper is marked for a certain timeone minute two three four and so on the dippers filled with eggs are pushed down into the water no need to worry lest they should be done to a bullet for at the expiry of a minute up springs the oneminute dipper; and after each succeeding minute the others follow in due rotation where eggs or more are devoured daily this ingenious automatic device plays no mean part  the searchlight all liners and war vessels now carry apparatus which will enable them to detect danger at night time whether rocks or an enemy's fleet icebergs or a waterlogged derelict on the bridge or on some other commanding part of the vessel's structure is a circular glassfronted case backed with a mirror of peculiar shape inside are two carbon points almost touching across which at the turn of a handle leaps a shower of sparks so continuous as to form a dazzling light the rays from the electric arc as it is called either pass directly through the glass lens or are caught by the parabolic reflector and shot back through it in an almost parallel pencil of wonderful intensity which illumines the darkness like a ray of sunshine slanting through a crack in the shutter of a room the searchlight draws its current from special dynamos which absorb many horsepower in the case of the powerful apparatus used on warships at a distance of several miles a page of print may be easily read by the beams of these scrutinisers of the night the finest searchlights are to be found ashore at naval ports where in case of war a sharp lookout must be kept for hostile vessels portsmouth boasts a light of over a million candlepower but even this is quite eclipsed by a monster light built by the schuckert company of nuremberg germany which gives the effect of candles an instrument of such power would be useless on board ship owing to the great amount of current it devours but in a port connected with the lighting plant of a large town it would serve to illumine the country round for many miles in addition to its value as an eye the searchlight can be utilised as an ear ernst ruhmer a german scientist has discovered a method of telephoning along a beam of light from a naval projector the amount of current passing into the arc is regulated by the pulsations of a telephone battery and transmitter if the beam be caught by a parabolic reflector in the focus of which is a selenium cell connected with a battery and a pair of sensitive telephone receivers the effect of these pulsations of light is heard selenium being a metal which varies its resistance to an electric circuit in proportion to the intensity of light shining upon it any fluctuations of the searchlight's beams cause electric fluctuations of equal rapidity in the telephone circuit; and since these waves arise from the vibrations of speech the electric vibrations they cause in the selenium circuit are retransformed at the receiver into the sounds of speech this german apparatus makes it possible to send messages nine or ten miles over a powerful projector beam in the united states navy and in other navies as well night signals are flashed by the electric light the pattern of lamp used in the united states navy is divided transversely into two compartments the upper having a white the lower a red lens four of these lamps are hung one above the other from a mast a switchboard connected with the eight incandescent lamps in the series enables the operator to send any required signal one letter or figure being flashed at a time during the spanishamerican war the united states fleet made great use of this simple system which on a clear night is very effective up to distances of four miles large arclamps slung on yards over the deck give great help for coaling and unloading vessels at night time the touch of a switch lights up the deck with the brilliancy of a wellequipped railway station the day of the lantern dimly burning has long passed away from the big liner cargo boat and warship  wireless telegraphy instruments solitude is being rapidly banished from the earth's surface by solitude we mean entire separation from news of the world and the inability to get into touch with people far away on the remote ranches of the united states in sequestered norwegian fiords in the folds of the eternal hills where the only other living creature is the eagle man may still be as conversant with what is going on in china or peru as if he were living in the busy streets of a capital town the electric wire is the magic newsbringer wherever man can go it can go too and also into many places besides we must make one exceptionthe surface of the sea cables rest on ocean's bed but they would be useless if floated on its surface to act as marine telegraph offices winds and waves would soon batter them to pieces even if they could be moored which in a thousand fathoms may be considered impracticable so until a few years back the occupants of a ship were truly isolated from the time that they left port until they reached land again except for the rare occasions when a passing vessel might give them a fragment of news this has all been changed stroll into the saloon of one of our large atlantic liners and you will see telegram forms lying on the tables in the 'nineties they would have been about as useful aboard ships as a mackintosh coat in the sahara a glance however at pamphlets scattered around informs you that the ship carries a marconi wireless installation and that a marconi telegram handed in at the ship's telegraph office will be despatched on the wings of ether waves to the land far over the horizon inside the cabin streams of sparks scintillate with a cracking noise and your message shoots into space from a wire suspended on insulators from one of the mast heads if circumstances favour you may receive a reply from the unseen before the steamer has got out of range of the coast stations the immense installations at poldhu cornwall and in newfoundland could be used to flash the words to a ship at any point of the transatlantic journey owing to lack of space and consequently power the steamer's transmitting apparatus has a limited capacity the first shipping company to grasp the possibilities of the commercial working of the marconi system was the norddeutscherlloyd whose mail steamer kaiser wilhelm der grosse was fitted in march at the present time many of the large atlantic steamship companies carry a wireless installation as a matter of course ranking it among necessary things the cunard american atlantic transport allan compagnie transatlantique hamburgamerican and norddeutscherlloyd lines make full use of the system as the conveniences it gives far outweigh any expense a short time since maritime signalling was extremely limited in its range being effected by flags semaphores lights and sounds which in stormy weather became uncertain agents and in foggy useless also the operations of transmitting and receiving were so slow that many a message had to remain uncompleted the following paragraph which appeared in the times of december th is significant of the very practical value of marine wireless telegraphy the american steamer kroonland from antwerp for new york which as reported yesterday disabled her steering gear when west of the fastnet and had to put back arrived yesterday morning at queenstown the saloon passengers speak in the highest terms of praise of the utility of the marconi wireless telegraphy with which the liner is fitted and of the facility with which when the accident occurred the passengers were able to communicate with their friends in england scotland and the continent and even america and get replies before the irish coast was sighted the accident occurred on tuesday about noon when the liner was miles west of the fastnet and communication was at once made with the marconi station at crookhaven captain doxrud was enabled accordingly to send messages to the chief agents of the american line at antwerp stating the nature of the damage to the steering gear of the steamer and that he would have to abandon the idea of prosecuting the western voyage within an hour and a half a message was received by the captain from the agents instructing him what to do and at once the kroonland was headed for queenstown threefourths of the total number of the saloon passengers and a goodly number of the second cabin sent messages to their friends in various parts of the world and replies were received even from the continent before the fastnet was sighted seven or eight passengers telegraphed to relatives for money and replies were received in four instances authorising the purser to advance the amounts required and the money was paid over in each case to the passengers the possibility of thus communicating between vessel and land or vessel and vessel removes much of the anxiety attending a sea voyage business men for whom even a few days' want of touch with the mercantile markets may be a serious matter can send long messages in code or otherwise instructing their agents what to do; while they can receive information to shape their actions when they reach land the uncommercial traveller also is pleased and grateful on receiving a message from home the feeling of loneliness is eliminated the ocean has lost its right to the term bestowed by horacedissociabilis the separator illustration photo cribb southsea fixing a battleram the ram of a battleship being placed in position with the aid of a huge crane the size of the ram will be appreciated from the dwarfing effect it has on that of the man perched near the lifting tackle steamship companies vie with one another in their efforts to keep their passengers well posted in the latest news bulletins or small newspapers are issued daily during the voyage which give in very condensed form accounts of events interesting to those on board the amount of fresh news a steamer gathers during a passage is considerable and is greatly relished by the passengers who are invariably ravenous for signs of the busy life they left behind more especially when they have departed on the verge of some important event taking place; and the bulletins are eagerly sought for when it is announced that an inwardbound ship is in communication the shipowners realise the importance and usefulness of being able to communicate with their commanders before the huge vessels enter narrow waters and issue instructions concerning their movements the stations which are placed at carefullyselected points at welladapted distances around the coast are connected with either the land telegraph or telephone line or are close to a telegraph office they are kept open night and day as the times of the ships passing are of course greatly dependent on the weather encountered during the voyage for those on shore who are anxious to greet their friends on arrivalwith good or bad news as the case may bethis arrangement enables them to be informed of the exact time of the ship's expected arrival and they are left free to their own devices instead of enduring long waits on draughty piers and dockswhich on a wet or windy day are almost enough to damp the warmest and most enthusiastic welcome cases have occurred where a telegram sent from the american side to an outlying english landstation two days after a ship has left has been transmitted to an outgoing steamer which in turn has retransmitted it to the astonished passenger two days prior to his arrival off the english coast; and it has now become quite a common thing for competing teams on vessels many miles apart and out of sight of each other to arrange chess matches with each other some of these interesting events taking two or more days to be played to a finish for naval purposes wireless telegraphy has assumed an importance which can hardly be overestimated as the whole efficiency of a fine fleet may depend upon a single message flashed through space all navies are fitting instruments the british admiralty being well to the fore even in manoeuvres and during the execution of tactical formations the apparatus is constantly at work the admiral gives the word and a dozen paper tapes moving jerkily through morse machines pass the message round the fleet the japanese naval successes have doubtless been largely due to their uptodate employment of this latest development of western electrical science no one knows how soon the time may come when the fate of a nation may depend on the proper working of a machine covering a few square feet of a cabin table; for rapid as has been the growth of wireless telegraphy it is yet in its infancy  safety devices a ship is usually divided into compartments by cross bulkheads of steel in event of a collision or damage by torpedoes or shell the water rushing through the break can be prevented from swamping the ship by closing the bulkhead doors messrs j stone and company of deptford have patented a system of hydraulically operated bulkhead doors which is finding great favour among shipbuilders on account of its versatility each door is closed by an hydraulic cylinder placed above it the valves of the cylinder are opened automatically by a float when the water rises in the compartment and every cylinder is also controllable independently from the bridge and other stations in the ship and by separate hand levers alongside the bulkhead the doors can therefore be closed collectively or individually should it happen that when a door has been closed someone is imprisoned the prisoner can open the door by depressing a lever inside the compartment and make his escape but the door is closed behind him by the action of the float  the transmission of power on a ship there are four power agents available on board ship all derived directly or indirectly from the steam boilers they are steam  highpressure water  compressed air  electricity on some ships we may find all four working side by side to drive the multifarious auxiliaries since each has its peculiar advantages and disadvantages at the same time marine engineers prefer to reduce the number as far as possible since each class of transmission needs specially trained mechanics and introduces its special complications let us take the four agents in order and briefly consider their value steam is so largely used in all departments of engineering that its working is better understood by the bulk of average mechanics than hydraulic power compressed air or electricity but for marine work it has very serious drawbacks especially on a war vessel imagine a ship which contains a network of steampipes running from end to end and from side to side the pipes must on account of the many obstacles they encounter twist and turn about in a manner which might be avoided on land where room is more available every bend means friction and loss of power again the condensation of steam in long pipes is notorious even if they are well jacketed a great deal of heat will radiate from the ducts into the belowdeck atmosphere which is generally too close and hot to be pleasant without any such further warming so that while power is lost discomfort increases with a decided lowering of human efficiency we must not forget either the risk attending the presence of a steampipe were it broken by accident or in a naval engagement a great loss of life might result or at least the abandonment of all neighbouring machinery for these reasons there is therefore a tendency to abolish the direct use of steam in the auxiliary machinery of a modern vessel highpressure water is free from heating and danger troubles and consequently is used for much heavy work such as training guns raising ashes and ammunition and steering one of its great advantages is its inelasticity which prevents the overrunning of gear worked by it water being incompressible gives a positive drive; thus if the pump delivers a pint at each stroke in the engineroom a pint must pass into the motor assuming that all joints are tight and the work due from the passage of one pint is done air and steamand electricity too if not very delicately controlledare apt to work in fits and starts when operating against varying resistance and run away from the engineer an objection to hydraulic power is that all leakage from the system must be replaced by fresh water manufactured on board which as we have seen is no easy task compressed air like steam may cause explosions; but when it escapes in small quantities only it has a beneficial effect in cooling and freshening the air below decks the exhaust from an airdriven motor is welcome for the same reason that it aids ventilation on a fighting ship it is of the utmost importance that the personnel should be in good physical condition; and when the battlehatches have been battened down for an engagement any supply of fresh oxygen means an increased staying power for officers and crew poisoned air brings mental slackness and weakening of resolve; so that if the motive power of heavy machinery can be made to do a second duty so much the better for all concerned compressed air also proves useful as a waterexcluder if a vessel contain as it should a number of watertight compartments any water rushing into one of these can be expelled by injecting air until the pressure inside is equal to that of the draught of water of the vessel outside on land compressedair installations include reservoirs of large size in which air can be stored till needed and which take the place of the accumulator used with hydraulic power on shipboard want of space reduces such reservoirs to minimum dimensions so that the compressors must squirt their air almost directly into the cylinders which do the work when the load or work is constantly varying this direct drive proves somewhat of a nuisance since the compressors if worked continuously at their maximum capacity must waste large quantities of air while if run spasmodically as occasion demands they require much more attention it is therefore considered advisable by some marine engineers to make compressed air perform as many functions as possible when it is present on a vessel the united states monitor terror is an instance of a warship which depends on this agency for working her guns and turrets handling ammunition anda somewhat unusual practicecontrolling the helm the last operation is performed by two large cylinders placed face to face athwart the ship they have a common pistonrod in the middle of which is a slot for the tiller to pass through air is admitted to the cylinders by a valve which is controlled by wires passing over a train of wheels from different stations on the ship an ingenious device automatically prevents the tiller from moving over too fast and also helps to lessen the shocks given to the rudder by a heavy sea we now come to electricity the fourth and most modern form of transmission its chief recommendation is that the wires through which it flows lend themselves readily to a tortuous course without in any way throttling the passage of power and as every ship must carry a generating plant for lighting purposes the same staff will serve to tend a second plant for auxiliary machinery electric motors work with practically no vibration are light for their power and can be very easily controlled from a distance they therefore enjoy increasing favour; and are found in deckwinches anchorcapstans ammunition hoists ventilation blowers and cranes they also control the movements of gunturrets having been found most suitable for this work if the current were to get loose in a ship it would undoubtedly cause more damage than an escape of compressed air or water electricity even when every known means of keeping it within bounds has been tried is suspected of causing deterioration to the metalwork of ships but these disadvantages are not serious enough to hamper the progress of electrical science as applied to marine engineering; and the undoubted economy of the electric motor its noiselessness its manageableness and comparatively small size will no doubt in the future lead to its much more extensive use on board our floating palaces and floating forts footnotes  f m bennett in the journal of the american society of naval engineers  charles v daly in the magazine of commerce chapter xiii the nurse of the navy  just as a navy requires floating distilleries floating coal stores and floating docks so does it find very important uses for a floating workshop which can accompany a fleet to sea and execute such repairs as might otherwise entail the return of a ship to port the british navy has a valuable ally of this kind in the torpedo depôt ship vulcan which contains so much machinery in addition to the auxiliaries already described that a short account of this vessel will be interesting the vulcan known as the nurse of the navy was launched in she measures feet in length feet in beam and has a displacement of tons her bunkers of which there are twentyone hold tons of coal independently of an extra tons which can be stowed in other neighbouring compartments when fully coaled she can cruise for miles at a speed of knots; or travel at firstclass cruiser speed for shorter distances the most striking objects on the vulcan are two huge hydraulic cranes placed almost amidships abreast of one another they have a total height of feet and overhang feet so as to be able to lift boats when the torpedonets are out and the sides of the vessel cannot be approached the feet of the cranes sink feet through the ship to secure rigidity and the upper deck which bears most of the strain is strongly reinforced inside the pillar of each crane is the lifting machinery an hydraulic ram inches in diameter and of foot stroke by means of fourfold pulleys the lift is increased to feet when working under the full pressure of lbs to the square inch the cranes have a hoisting power of twenty tons in addition to the main ram there is a much smaller one the function of which is to keep the slings or cables by which the boat is hoisted taut after a boat has been hooked until the actual moment of lifting comes but for this arrangement there would be a danger of the slings slackening as the boat rises and falls in a seaway the small ram controls the larger and the latter cannot come into action until its auxiliary has tightened up the slings so that no dangerous jerk can occur when the hoisting begins the cranes are revolved by two sets of hydraulic rams which operate chains passing round drums at the feet of the cranes and turn them through threequarters of a circle on the vulcan's deck lie six torpedo boats and three despatch boats the former are feet long and can attain a speed of knots an hour when an enemy is sighted these would be sent off to worry the hostile vessels with their deadly torpedoes and on their return would be quickly picked up and restored to their berths ready for further use illustration photo cribb a inch gun being lowered into its place in the turret of a warship by a gigantic sheerleg crane one leg of which is partly visible on the left of the picture the cranes also serve to lift on board heavy pieces of machinery from other vessels for repair down below decks is the workshop wherein jobs are done on the high seas it has quite a respectable equipment five lathes ranging from feet to feet in length; drilling planing slotting shaping punching machines; a carpenter's bench; fitters' benches; and a furnace for melting steel there is also a blacksmith's shop with an hydraulic forging press and a forge blown by machinery; not to mention a large array of tools of all kinds special engines are installed to operate the repairs department the vulcan also carries searchlights of candlepower; bilge pumps which will deliver over tons of water per hour; two sets of engines for supplying the hydraulic machinery; aircompressing engines to feed the whitehead torpedoes; a distilling plant; and last but by no means least main engines of hp drawing steam from four huge cylindrical boilers feet long and feet in diameter altogether the vulcan is a very complete floating workshop sufficiently speedy to keep up with a fleet and even to do scouting work her guns and her torpedo craft would render her a very troublesome customer in a fight though being practically unarmoured she would keep as clear of the conflict as possible acting on the offensive through the proxy of her hornets she constitutes the first of a type of vessel which has been suggested by experts viz one of high speed and unarmoured but capable of carrying a swarm of torpedo boats which could be launched in pursuit of the foe even if per cent of the craft were destroyed the price would be small if a single torpedo were successfully fired at a battleship the naval motor boat to which reference has already been made would just fill the bill for such a cruiser; and in the event of a score of them being dropped into the water at a critical moment they might easily turn the scale in favour of their side chapter xiv the mechanism of diving  diving being a profession which can be carried on in its simplest form with the simplest possible apparatusmerely a rope and a stoneits history reaches back into the dim and inexplorable past we may well believe that the first man who explored the depths of the sea for treasure lived as long ago as the first seeker for minerals in the bosom of the earth even when we come to the various appliances which have been gradually developed in the course of centuries our records are very imperfect alexander the great is said to have descended in a machine which kept him dry while he sought for fresh worlds to conquer below the waves aristotle mentions a device enabling men to remain some time under water this is all the information and a very meagre total too that we get from classical times stepping across years we reach the thirteenth century about the middle of which roger bacon is said to have invented the divingbell but like some other discoveries attributed to that middleage physicist the authenticity of this rests on very slender foundations in a book published early in the sixteenth century there appears an illustration of a diver wearing a cap or helmet to which is attached a leather tube floated on the surface of the water by an inflated bag this is evidently the diving dress in its crudest form; and when we read how in two greeks made a submarine trip under a huge inverted chamber which kept them dry in the presence of the great emperor charles v and some spectators we recognise the divingbell now so well known the latter device did not reach a really practical form till when dr halley a member of the royal society built a bell of wood lined with lead the divers were supplied with air by having casksfull lowered to them as required to quote his own words to supply air to this bell under water i caused a couple of barrels of about thirty gallons each to be cased with lead so as to sink empty each of them having a bunghole in its lowest parts to let in the water as the air in them condensed on their descent and to let it out again when they were drawn up full from below and to a hole in the uppermost parts of these barrels i fixed a leathern hose long enough to fall below the bunghole being kept down by a weight appended so that the air in the upper parts of the barrels could not escape unless the lower ends of these hose were first lifted up the airbarrels being thus prepared i fitted them with tackle proper to make them rise and fall alternately after the manner of two buckets in a well; and in their descent they were directed by lines fastened to the under edge of the bell which passed through rings on both sides of the leathern hose in each barrel so that sliding down by these lines they came readily to the hand of a man who stood on purpose to receive them and to take up the ends of the hose into the bell through these hose as soon as their ends came above the surface of the water in the barrels all the air that was included in the upper parts of them was blown with great force into the bell whilst the water entered at the bungholes below and filled them and as soon as the air of one barrel had been thus received upon a signal given that was drawn up and at the same time the other descended and by an alternate succession provided air so quick and in such plenty that i myself have been one of five who have been together at the bottom in nine to ten fathoms water for above an hour and a half at a time without any sort of illconsequence and i might have continued there so long as i pleased for anything that appeared to the contrary after referring to the fact that when the sea was clear and the sun shining he could see to read or write in the submerged bell thanks to a glass window in it the doctor goes on to say this i take to be an invention applicable to various uses such as fishing for pearls diving for coral or sponges and the like in far greater depths than has hitherto been thought possible; also for the fitting and placing of the foundations of moles bridges etc in rocky bottoms and for cleaning and scrubbing ships' bottoms when foul in calm weather at sea i shall only intimate that by an additional contrivance i have found it not impracticable for a diver to go out of an engine to a good distance from it the air being conveyed to him with a continued stream by small flexible pipes which pipes may serve as a clue to direct him back again when he would return to the bell we have italicised certain words to draw attention to the fact that dr halley had invented not only the diving bell but also the diving dress though he foresaw practically all the uses to which diving mechanism could be put the absence of a means for forcing air under pressure into the bell or dress greatly limited the utility of his contrivances since the deeper they sank below the water the further would the latter rise inside them it was left for john smeaton of eddystone lighthouse fame to introduce the airpump as an auxiliary which by making the pressure of the air inside the bell equal to that of the water outside kept the bell quite free of water smeaton replaced halley's tub by a square solid castiron box cwt in weight large enough to accommodate two men at a time the modern bell is merely an enlarged edition of this type furnished with telephones electric lamps and in some cases with a special airlock into which the men may pass when the bell is raised the pressure in the airlock is very gradually decreased after the bell has reached the surface if work has been conducted at great depths so that the evil effects sometimes attending a sudden change of pressure on the body may be avoided diving bells are very useful for laying submarine masonry usually consisting of huge stone blocks set in hydraulic cement helmet divers explore and prepare the surface on which the blocks are to be placed then the bell slung either from a crane on the masonry already built above waterlevel or from a specially fitted barge comes into action the block is lowered by its own crane on to the bottom the bell descends upon it and the crew seize it with tackle suspended inside the bell instructions are sent up as to the direction in which the bell should be moved with its burden and as soon as the exact spot has been reached the signal for lowering is given and the stone settles on to the cement laid ready for it the modern diver is not sent out from a bell but has his separate and independent apparatus the first practical diving helmet was that of kleingert a german this enclosed the diver as far as the waist and constituted a small diving bell since the bottom was open for the escape of vitiated air twenty years later or just a century after the invention of halley's bell augustus siebe the founder of the present great london firm of siebe gorman and company produced a more convenient open dress consisting of a copper helmet and shoulderplate in one piece attached to a waterproof jacket reaching to the hips the disadvantage of the open dress was that the diver had to maintain an almost upright position or the water would have invaded his helmet mr siebe therefore added a necessary improvement and extended the dress to the feet giving his diver a close protection from the water we may pass over the gradual development of the close dress and glance at the most uptodate equipment in which the toilers of the deep explore the bed of old ocean the dresslegging body and sleevesis all in one piece with a largeenough opening at the shoulders for the body to pass through the helmet with front and side windows is attached by a bayonet joint to the shoulderplate itself made fast to the upper edge of the dress by screws which press a metal ring against the lower edge of the plate so as to pinch the edge of the dress illustration photo cribb the diver at work note the telephone attachment the wires of which are embedded in the lifeline held by the bluejacket on the left by means of the telephone the diver can give and receive full instructions about his work at the back are an inlet and an outlet valve between the front and a side window is the transmitter of a loudsounding telephone and in the crown the receiver and the button of an electric bell the telephone wires and also the wires for a powerful electric light working on a ballandsocket joint in front of the dress are embedded into the lifeline the airtube of canvas and rubber has a stiffening of wire to prevent its being throttled on coming into contact with any object a pair of weighted boots each scaling lbs two lb lead weights slung over the shoulder and a knife worn at the waistbelt complete the outfit of the diver which not including the several layers of underclothing necessary to exclude the cold found at great depths totals nearly lbs of this the copper helmet accounts for lbs on the surface are the airpumps which may be of several typessinglecylinder doubleacting; doublecylinder doubleacting; or three or four cylinder singleactingaccording to the nature of the work all patterns are so constructed that the valves may be easily removed and examined the pressure on a diver increases in the ratio of about lbs for every ten feet he descends below the surface a novice experiences severe pains in the ears and eyes at a few fathoms' depth which however pass off when the pressures both inside and outside of the various organs have become equalised on rising to the surface again the pains recur since the external pressure on the body falls more quickly than the internal the rule for all divers therefore is slow down slow up men of good constitution and resourcefulness are needed for the profession of diving only a few can work at extreme depths though an old hand is able to remain for several hours at a time in sixty feet of water the record depth reached by a diver is claimed by james hooper who when removing the cargo of the cape horn wrecked off the coast of south america made seven descents to feet one of which lasted fortytwo minutes in spite of the dangers and inconveniences attached to his calling the diver finds in it compensations and even fascinations which outweigh its disadvantages the pay is good£ to £ a dayand in deepsea salvage he often gets a substantial percentage of all the treasure recovered the percentage rising as the depth increases thus the diver alexander lambert who performed some plucky feats during the driving of the severn tunnel received £ for the recovery of £ worth of gold from the alphonso xii sunk off grand canary divers ridyard and penk recovered £ from the hamilla mitchell which lay in feet of water off shanghai after nearly being captured by chinese pirates; and we could add many other instances in which treasure has been rescued from the maw of the sea the most useful sphere for a diver is undoubtedly connected with the harbour work and the cleaning of ships' bottoms for the latter purpose every large warship in the british navy carries at least one diver after ships have been long in the water barnacles and marine growths accumulate on the belowwater plates in such quantities as to seriously diminish the ship's speed which means a great waste of fuel and would entail a loss of efficiency in case of war breaking out armed with the proper tools a gang of divers will soon clean the foul bottom at a much smaller cost of time and money than would be incurred by drydocking the vessel the navy has at portsmouth sheerness and devonport schools where diving is taught to picked men the depth in which they work being gradually increased to feet messrs siebe and gorman employ hundreds of divers in all parts of the world on all kinds of submarine work and they are able to boast that never has a defect in their apparatus been responsible for a single death this is due both to the very careful tests to which every article is subjected before it leaves their works and also to the thorough training given to their employés in the sponge and pearlfishing industries the diving dress is gradually ousting the unaided powers of the naked diver one man equipped with a standard dress can do the work of twenty natural divers and do it more efficiently as he can pick and choose his material this chapter may conclude with a reference to the apparatus now used in exploring or rescue work in mines where deadly fumes have overcome the miners it consists of an airtight mask connected by tubes to a chamber full of oxygen and to a bag containing materials which absorb the carbonic acid of exhaled air the wearer uses the same air over and over again and is able to remain independent of the outer atmosphere for more than an hour the apparatus is also useful for firemen when they have to pass through thick smoke footnote  vide the romance of modern engineering p chapter xv apparatus for raising sunken ships and treasure  it is somewhat curious that while the sciences connected with the building of ships have progressed with giant strides little attention has been paid to the art of raising vessels which have found watery graves in comparatively shallow depths the total shipping losses of a single year make terrible reading since they represent the extinction of many brave sailors and the disappearance of huge masses of the world's wealth a life lost is lost for ever but cargoes can be recovered if not sunk in water deeper than feet yet with all our modern machinery the percentage of vessels raised from even shallow depths is small there are practically only two methods of raising a foundered ship first to caulk up all leaks and pump her dry; and secondly to pass cables under her and lift her bodily by the aid of pontoons or camels the second method is that more generally used especially in the estuaries of big rivers where there is a considerable tide the pontoons having a united displacement greater than that of the vessel to be raised are brought over her at low tide divers pass under her bottom huge steel cables which are attached to the camels as the tide flows the pontoons sink until they have displaced a weight of water equal to that of the vessel and then they begin to raise her and can be towed into shallower water to repeat the process if necessary next tide as soon as the deck is above water the vessel may be pumped empty when all leaks have been stopped in water where there is no tide the natural lift must be replaced by artificial power under such circumstances the salvage firms use lighters provided with powerful winches each able to lift up to tons on huge steel cables nearly a foot in diameter the winches can be moved across a lighter the cables falling perpendicularly through transverse wells almost dividing the lighter into separate lengths so as to get a direct pull if the wreck has only half the displacement of the lighters the cables can be passed over rollers on the inner edges of the pontoons the weight of the raising vessel being counteracted by water let into compartments in the outer side of the pontoons there are ten great salvage companies in the british isles and europe the best equipped of these is the neptune company of stockholm which has raised vessels worth over £ sterling even in their damaged condition among them the illfated submarine a yet this total represents but a small part of the wealth that has gone to the bottom within a short distance of our coasts turning from the salvage of wrecks to the salvage of precious metal and bulky objects that are known to strew the seafloor in many places we must notice the hydroscope the invention of cavaliere pino an italian in there sank in vigo bay on the northwest coast of spain twentyfive galleons laden with treasure from america as the result of an attack by english and dutch menofwar gold representing £ was on those vessels down it went to the bottom and there it is still so rich a prize has naturally not failed to attract daring spirits among whom was giuseppe pino this inventor has produced many devices the most notable among them the hydroscope which may best be described as a huge telescope for peering into the depths of the sea a large circular tank floats on the top of the water from the centre of its bottom hangs a series of tubes fitting one into the other so that the whole series can be shortened or lengthened at will through the tubes a man can descend to the chamber at their lower extremity in the sides of which are twelve lenses specially made by saint gobain of paris which act as submarine telescopes pino's hydroscope has been at work for some time in vigo bay its operations closely watched by a spanish war vessel which will exact per cent of all treasure recovered while the hydroscope acts as an eye the lifting of an object is accomplished by attaching to it large canvas bags furnished with airtight internal rubber bladders these have air pumped into them till its pressure overcomes that of the water outside and the bag then rises like a cork carrying its load with it an elevatornine sacks fixed to one framewill raise twentyfive to thirty tons so far cavaliere pino has salvaged old spanish guns cannonballs and pieces of valuable old wood; and presently he may alight on the specie which is the main object of his search another spanish wreck the florida which was a unit of the spanish armada and sank in tobermory bay the isle of mull has many times been attacked by divers the last attempt made to recover the treasure which that illfated vessel was reputed to bear is that of the steam lighter sealight which employed a very powerful sand pump to suck up any objects which it might encounter on the seabottom many interesting relics have been raised by the pumps and attendant diverscoins bones jewels timbers cannon muskets pistols swords and a compass which is so constructed that pressure on the top causes the legs to spread one of the cannon fiftyfour inches long has a separate powder chamber the shot and wad still in the gun and traces of powder in the chamber it is curious that what we usually consider so modern an invention as the breechloading cannon should be found side by side with stone balls the heavier objects were of course raised by divers in this quest also the treasure deposit has not yet been tapped chapter xvi the handling of grain the elevatorthe suction pneumatic grainlifterthe pneumatic blast grainlifterthe combined system  the elevator on or near the quays of our large seaports london liverpool manchester bristol hull leith dublin may be seen huge buildings of severe and ugly outline utterly devoid of any attempt at decoration yet we should view them with respect for they are to the inhabitants of the british isles what the inland granaries of egypt were to the dwellers by the nile in the time of joseph could we strip off the roofs and walls of these structures we should see vast bins full of wheat or spacious floors deeply strewn with the material for countless loaves the grain warehouses of britainthe americans would term them elevatorshave a total capacity of quarters multiply those figures by eight and you have the number of bushels each of which will yield the flour for about forty lb loaves in these granaries is stored the grain which comes from abroad with the opening up of new lands in north and south america and the exploitation of the great wheatgrowing steppes of russia english agriculture has declined and we are content to import fivesixths of our breadstuffs and an even larger proportion of grain foods for domestic animals it arrives from the united states india russia argentina canada and australia in vessels often built specially for grain transport; and as it cannot be immediately distributed must be stored in bulk in properly designed buildings these contain either many storeys over which the grain is spread to get rid of superfluous moisture which might cause dangerous heating; or huge bins or silos in which it can be kept from contact with the air experiments have proved that wheat is more successfully preserved if the air is excluded than if left in the open provided that it is dry the ancient egyptians used brick granaries filled from the top and tapped at the bottom in which to judge by the account of a grievous famine given in the book of genesis their wheat was preserved for at least seven years during last century the silo fell into disrepute; but now we have gone back to the egyptian plan of closed bins which are constructed of wood brick ferroconcrete or iron and are of square hexagonal or round section they are set close together many under one roof to economise space; as many as bushels being provided for in the largest english storehouse such vast quantities of grain require welldevised machinery for their transport from ship to bin or floor weighing clearing and for their transference to barges coasting vessels or railway trucks the alexander grain warehouse of liverpool may be taken as a typical example of a wellequipped silo granary it measures by feet and contains hexagonal bins of brickwork each feet deep and feet in diameter the grain is lifted from barges by four elevators placed at intervals along the edge of the quay the elevator is a wooden case or feet high in which an endless band furnished with buckets travels over two rollers placed at the top and bottom these are let down into the hold and scoop up the grain at the rate of from to tons per hour according to their size as soon as a bucket reaches the top roller it empties its charge into a spout which delivers the grain into a bin whence it is lifted again feet by a second elevator to a bin from which it flows by gravity to a weighing hopper beneath; and as soon as two tons has collected the contents are emptied automatically into a distributing hopper after all this the grain still has a long journey before it; for it is now shot out on to an endless flat conveyer belt moving at a rate of to feet per second it is carried horizontally by this for some distance along the quay and falls on to a second belt moving at right angles to the first which whisks it off to the receiving elevators of the storehouse once more it is lifted this time feet to the top floor of the building and dropped on to a third belt which runs over a movable throwingoff carriage this can be placed at any point of the belt's travel to transfer the grain to any of the spouts leading to the bins here it rests for a time when needed for the market it flows out at the bottom of a bin on to belts leading to delivery elevators from which it may be either passed back to a storage bin after being well aired or shot into wagons or vessels from first to last a single grain may have to travel three miles between the ship and the truck without being touched once by a human hand the vertical transport of grain is generally effected by an endless belt to which buckets are attached at short intervals the grain fed to the buckets either by hand or by mechanical means is scooped up whirled aloft and when it has passed the topmost point of its travel and just as the bucket is commencing the descent it flies by centrifugal force into a hopper which guides it to the travelling belt as already described of late years however much attention has been paid to pneumatic methods of elevating by which a cargo is transferred from ship to storehouse or from ship to ship through flexible tubes the motive power being either the pressure of atmospheric air rushing in to fill a vacuum or highpressure air which blows the grain through the tube in much the same way as a steam injector forces water into a boiler sometimes both systems are used in combination we will first consider these methods separately  the suction pneumatic grainlifter is the invention of mr fred e duckham engineer of the millwall docks london the ships in which grain is brought to england often contain a mixed cargo as well; and that the unloading of this may proceed simultaneously with the moving of the wheat it is necessary to keep the hatches clear as long as the grain is directly under a hatchway a bucket elevator can reach it; but all that is not so conveniently situated must be brought within range of the buckets this means a large bill for labour even if machinery is employed to help the trimming mr duckham therefore designed an elevator which could easily reach any corner of a ship's interior the principal parts are a large cylindrical airtight tank an engine to exhaust air from the same and long hoses armoured inside with a steel lining connected at one end to the tank and furnished at the other with a nozzle these hoses extend from the receiving tank to the grain which when the air has been exhausted to five or six pounds to the square inch flies up the tubes into the tank at the bottom of the tank are ingenious airlocks to allow the grain to pass into a bin below without admitting air to spoil the vacuum the locks are automatic and as soon as a certain quantity of grain has collected tip sideways closing the port through which it flowed and allowing it to drop through a hinged door two locks are attached together the one discharging while the other is filling an elevator of this kind will shift tons or more an hour mr duckham claims for his invention that it has no limit in capacity it is practically independent of everything but its own steam power; and the labour of one man suffices to keep its flexible suckers buried in grain no corner is inaccessible to the nozzle the pipes occupy only a very small part of the hatchway they can be set to work immediately a vessel comes alongside as many as a quarter of a million bushels are handled daily by one of these machines the pneumatic elevator is often installed on a floating base so that it may be moved about in a dock  the pneumatic blast grainlifter differs from the system just described in that the grain is driven through the pipes or hoses by air compressed to several pounds above atmospheric pressure a small tube attached to the main hose conveys compressed air to the nozzle through which grain enters the tube the nozzle consists of a short length of metal piping which is buried in the grain one half of it is encased by a jacket into which the compressed air rushes as the air escapes at high speed past the inner end of the piping into the main hose it causes a vacuum in the piping and draws in grain which is shot up the hose by the pressure behind it as already remarked the action of this pneumatic elevator is similar to that of a steam injector  the combined system under some conditions it is found convenient to employ both suction and blast in combination suction to draw the grain from a vessel's hold into elevators from which it is transferred to the warehouse by blast special boats are built for this work eg the garryowen which has on board suction plant for transferring grain from a ship to barges and also blowing apparatus for elevating it into storehouses or into another ship the garryowen has the hull and engines of an ordinary screw steamer so that it can ply up and down the shannon and partly unload a vessel to reduce its draught sufficiently to allow it to reach limerick docks floating elevators of this kind are able to handle upwards of tons of grain per hour chapter xvii mechanical transporters and conveyers mechanical conveyersropewayscablewaystelpheragecoaling warships at sea  a man carrying a sack of coal over a plank laid from the wharf to the ship's side a bricklayer's labourer moving slowly up a ladder with his hod of mortarthese illustrate the most primitive methods of shifting material from one spot to another when the wheelbarrow is used in the one case and a rope and pulley in the other an advance has been made but the effort is still great in proportion to the work accomplished; and were such processes universal in the great industries connected with mining and manufacture the labour bill would be ruinous the development of methods of transportation has gone on simultaneously with the improvement of machinery of all kinds to be successful an industry must be conducted economically throughout thus to follow the history of wheat from the time that it is selected for sowing till it forms a loaf we see it mechanically placed in the ground mechanically reaped threshed and dressed mechanically hauled to the elevator mechanically transferred to the bins of the same mechanically shot into trucks or a ship mechanically raised into a flourmill where it is cleaned ground weighed packed and trucked by machinery mechanically mixed with yeast and baked and possibly distributed by mechanically operated vehicles as a result we get a lb loaf for less than threepence anyone who thinks that the price is regulated merely by the amount of wheat grown is greatly mistaken for the cheapness of handling and transportation conduces at least equally to the cheapness of the finished article the same may be said of the metal articles with which every house is furnished a fender would be dearer than it is were not the iron ore cheaply transported from mine to rail from rail to the smelting furnace from the ground to the top of the furnace in short to whatever industry we look in which large quantities of raw or finished material have to be moved stored and distributed the mechanical conveyer has supplanted human labour to such an extent that in lack of such devices we can scarcely conceive how the industry could be conducted without either proving ruinous to the people who control it or enhancing prices enormously the types of elevators and conveyers now commonly used in all parts of the world are so numerous that in the following pages only some selected examples can be treated speaking broadly the mechanical transporter can be classified under two main heads those which handle materials continuously as in the case of belt conveyers pneumatic grain dischargers etc; and those which work intermittently such as the telpher which carries skips on an aerial ropeway the first class are most useful for short distances; the latter for longer distances or where the conditions are such that the material must be transported in large masses at a time by powerful grabs some transporters work only in a vertical direction; others only horizontally; while a third large section combine the two movements again while some are mere conveyers of material shot into or attached to them others scoop up their loads as they move the distinctions in detail are numerous and will be brought out in the chapters devoted to the various types  mechanical conveyers we have already noticed band conveyers in connection with the transportation of grain they are also used for handling coal coke diamond dirt gold ore and other minerals and for moving filled sacks the belts are sometimes made of rubber or of balata faced with rubber on the upper surface which has to stand most of the wear and tearsometimes of metal plates joined together by hinges at the ends a modification of the belt is the continuous trough with sloping or vertical sides this is built of openended sections jointed so that they may pass round the terminal rollers while travelling in a straight line the sides of the sections touch preventing any escape of the material carried but at the rollers the ends open in a vshape another form of conveyer has a stationary trough through which the substance to be handled is pulled along by plates attached to cables or endless chains running on rollers or the moving agency may be plates dragged backwards and forwards periodically the plates hanging in one direction only like flap valves so as to pass over the material during the backward stroke and bite it during the forward stroke the vibrating conveyer is a trough which moves bodily backwards and forwards on hinged supports the oscillation gradually shaking its contents along as no dragging or pushing plates are here needed this form of conveyer is very suitable for materials which are liable to be injured by rough treatment  ropeways a certain person on asking what was the distance from x to y received the reply it is ten miles as the crow flies the country being mountainous the answer did not satisfy him and he said oh! but you see i am not a crow engineers laying out a railway can sympathise with this gentleman for they know from sad experience that places only a few miles apart in a straight line often require a track many miles long to connect them if gradients are to be kept moderate now a locomotive a railway carriage or a goods truck is very heavy and must run on the firm bosom of mother earth but for comparatively light bodies a path may be made which much more nearly resembles the proverbial flight of the crow or as our american cousins would say a beeline if you have travelled in norway and switzerland you probably have noticed here and there steel wire ropes spanning a torrent or hanging across a narrow valley over these ropes the peasants shoot their hay crops or wood faggots from the mountainside to their homes or to a point near a road where the material can be transferred to carts adventurous folk even dare to entrust their own bodies to the seemingly frail steel thread using a brake to control the velocity of the descent the history of the modern ropeway and cableway dates from the 'thirties when the invention of wire rope supplied a flexible carrying agent of great strength in proportion to its weight and of sufficient hardness to resist much wear and tear and too inelastic to stretch under repeated stresses to prevent confusion we may at once state that a ropeway is an aerial track used only for the conveyance of material; whereas a cableway hoists as well as conveys a further distinctionthough it does not hold good in all casesmay be seen in the fact that while cableways are of a single span ropeways are carried for distances ranging up to twenty miles over towers or poles placed at convenient intervals ropeways fall into two main classes first those in which the rope supporting the weight of the thing carried moves; secondly those in which the carrier rope is stationary and the skips or tubs etc are dragged along it by a second rope the moving rope system is best adapted for light loads not exceeding six hundredweight or so; but over the second class bodies scaling five or six tons have often been moved in both systems the line may be single or double according to the amount of traffic which it has to accommodate the chief advantage of the double ropeway is that it permits a continuous service and an economy of power since in cases where material has to be delivered at a lower level than the point at which it is shipped the weight of the descending full trucks can be utilised to haul up ascending empty trucks spans of feet or twofifths of a mile are not at all unusual in very rough country where the spots on which supports can be erected are few and far between; but engineers naturally endeavour to make the span as short as possible in order to be able to use a small size of rope glancing at some interesting ropeways we may first notice that used in the construction of the new beachy head lighthouse recently erected on the foreshore below the head on which the original structure stands for the sake of convenience the workshops storage yards etc were placed on the cliffs feet above the sea and some feet in a direct line from the site of the new lighthouse between the cliff summit and a staging in the sea were stretched two huge steel ropes the one six inches in circumference for the track over which the fourton blocks of granite used in the building machinery tools etc should be lowered; the other inches in circumference for the return of the carriers and trucks containing workmen the ropes had a breaking strain of and tons respectively; that is to say if put in an hydraulic testing machine they would have withstood pulls equal to those exerted by masses of these weights hung on them their top ends were anchored in solid rock; their lower ends to a mass of concrete built up in the chalk forming the seabottom when a granite block was attached to the carrier travelling on the rope its weight was gradually transferred to the rope by lowering the truck on which it had arrived until the latter was clear of the block as soon as the stone started on its journey the truck was lifted again to the level of the rails and trundled away a brakesman stationed at a point whence he could command the whole ropeway had under his hand the brake wheels regulating the movements of the trailing ropes for lowering and hauling on the two tracks another interesting ropeway is that at hongkong which transports the workmen in a sugar factory on the low feverbreeding levels to their homes in the hills where they may sleep secure from noxious microbes the carriers accommodate six men at a time and move at the rate of eight miles an hour the sensation of being hauled through midair must be an exhilarating one and some of us would not mind changing places with the workmen for a trip or two reassured by the fact that this ropeway has been in operation for several years without any accident in southern india in the anamalai hills a ropeway is used for delivering sawn timber from the forests to a point miles below prior to the establishment of this ropeway the logs were sent down a circuitous mountain track on bullock carts its erection was a matter of great difficulty on account of the steep gradients and the dense and unhealthy forest through which a path had to be cut; not to mention the dragging uphill of a cable which with the reel on which it was wound weighed four tons for this last operation the combined strength of nine elephants and a number of coolies had to be requisitioned since the friction of the rope dragging on the ground was enormous however the engineers soon had the cable stretched over its supports and the winding machinery in place at the top of the grade the single rope serves for both up and down traffic; a central crossing station being provided at which the descending can pass the ascending carrier seven sleepers at a time are sent flying down the track at a rate of twenty miles an hour a load departing every halfhour the saving of labour time and expense is said to be very great and when the saw mills have a larger output the economy of working will be still more remarkable the longest passenger ropeway ever built is probably that over the chilkoot pass in alaska which was constructed in and to transport miners from dyea to crater lake on their way to the yukon goldfields from crater lake to the klondike the yukon river serves as a natural road but the climb to its head waters was a matter of great difficulty especially during the winter months and accompanied by much suffering but when the trestles had been erected for the fixed ropes two in number miners and their kits were hauled over the seven miles at little physical cost though naturally the charges for transportation ruled higher than in less rugged regions the opening of the white pass railway from skagway has largely abolished the need for this cable track which has nevertheless done very useful work the chilkoot ropeway has at least two spans of over feet as an engineering enterprise it claims our consideration since the conveyance of ropes timber engines etc into so inhospitable a region and the piecing of them together demanded great persistence on the part of the engineers and their employés  cableways for removing the overburden of surface mines and dumping it in suitable places for excavating canals for dredging and for many other operations in which matter has to be moved comparatively short distances the cableway is largely employed we have already noticed that it differs from the ropeway in that it has to hoist and discharge its burdens as well as convey them the cableway generally consists of a single span between two towers which are either fixed or movable on rails according to the requirements of the work to be done in addition to the main cable which bears the weight and the rope which moves the skips along it the cableway has the fall rope which lowers the skip to the ground and raises it; the dumping rope which discharges it; and the button rope which pulls blocks off the horn of the skip truck at intervals as the latter moves to support the fall rope from the main cable if the fall rope sagged its weight would after a certain amount had been paid out overcome the weight of the skip and render it impossible to lower the skip to the filling point so a series of fallrope carriers are at the commencement of a journey from one end of the cableway riding on an arm in front of the skip carriage the buttonrope passing under a pulley on the top of the skip carriage is furnished at intervals with buttons of a size increasing towards the point at which the skip must be lowered the holes in the carriers are similarly graduated so as to pass over any button but the one intended to arrest them if we watched a skip travelling to the lowering point we should notice that the carriers were successively pulled off the skip carriage by the buttons and strung along over the main cable and under the fall rope when the skip has been lowered and filled the fall and hauling ropes are wound in; the skip rises to the main cable and begins to travel towards the dumping point as long as the dumping rope is also hauled in at the same rate as the hauling rope it has no effect on the skip but when its rate of travel is increased by moving it on to a larger winding drum the skip is tipped or opened as the case may be without being arrested the skip may be filled by hand or made selffilling where circumstances permit the cableway is so economical in its working that it has greatly advanced the process of openpit mining where ore lies near the surface it is desirable to remove the useless overlying matter called overburden bodily and to convey it right away in preference to sinking shallow shafts with their attendant drawbacks of timbering and pumping an inclined railway is handicapped by the fact that it must occupy some of the surface to be uncovered while liable to blockage by the débris of blasting operations the suspended cableway neither obstructs anything nor can be obstructed and is profitably employed when a ton of ore is laid bare for every four tons of overburden removed in the case of the tilly foster mine new york where the removal of tons of rock exposed tons of ore from an excavation ft long by ft wide the saving effected by the cableway was enormous again referring to the chicago drainage canal the records show that while labourers sledging and filling into cars averaged only to cubic yards per man per day in filling into skips for the cable ways the labourers averaged from to cubic yards per day the first cableway erected by the lidgerwood manufacturing company for the prosecution of this engineering work handled cubic yards a month and proved so successful that nineteen similar plants were added the cableways are suspended in this instance from two towers moving on parallel tracks on each bank of the canal the towers being heavily ballasted on the outer sides of their bases to counteract the pull of the cable from time to time when a length had been cleared the towers were moved forward by engines hauling on fixed anchors the cableway is much used in the erection of masonry piers for bridges across rivers or valleys materials are conveyed by it rapidly and easily to points over the piers and lowered into position spans of over feet have been exceeded for such purposes; and if need be spans of feet could be made to carry loads of twentyfive tons at a rate of twenty miles an hour  telpherage on most ropeways the skips or other conveyances are moved along the fixed ropes by trailing ropes working round drums driven by steam and controlled by brakes but the employment of electricity has provided a system called telpherage in which the vehicle carries its own motor fed by current from the rope on which it runs and from auxiliary cables suspended a short distance above the main rope telpher is a term derived from two greek words signifying a far carrier since the motor so named will move any distance so long as a track and current is supplied to it the carrierfor ore coal earth barrels sacks timber etcis suspended from the telpher by the usual hookshaped support common to ropeways to enable the load to pass the arms of the posts or trestles bearing the rope the telpher usually has two motors one placed on each side of a twowheeled carriage so as to balance; but sometimes only a single motor is employed just above the running cable is the trolley cable from which the telpher picks up current through a hinged arm after the manner of an electric tram the carriers are controlled on steep grades by an electric braking device which acts automatically its effect varying with the speed at which the telpher runs the carrier wheels driven by the motors adhere to the cable without slipping on grades as severe as three in ten even when the surface has been moistened by rain in order to stop the telpher at any desired point the trolley wire is divided into a number of sections each controlled by a switch conveniently located by opening a switch the current is cut off from the corresponding section and the telpher will stop when it reaches this point it is again started by closing the switch at curves a section of the trolley wire ie overhead cable for current is connected to the source of current through a 'resistance' which lowers the voltage pressure of the current across the motors at this point thus upon approaching a curve the telpher automatically slows down runs slowly around the curve until it passes the resistance section and is then automatically accelerated the telpher line is very useful for transporting material considerable distances in districts where it would not pay to construct a surface railway on plantations it serves admirably to shift grain fruits tobacco and other agricultural products then again a wide field is open to it for transmitting light articles such as castings and parts of machinery from one part of a foundry or manufactory to another or from factory to vessel or truck for shipment when coal has to be handled the buckets are dumped automatically into bins the telpher has much the same advantages over the steamworked ropeway that an electric tram has over one moved by an endless cable its control is easier; there is less friction; and the speed is higher and in common with ropeways it can claim independence of obstructions on the ground and the ability to cross ravines with ease which in the case of a railway would have to be bridged at great expense  coaling warships at sea the war between russia and japan has brought prominently before the public the necessity of being able to keep a war vessel well supplied with coal a task by no means easy when coaling stations are few and far between the voyage of admiral rojdestvensky from russia to eastern waters was marked by occasions on which he entered neutral ports to draw supplies for his furnaces though we know that colliers sailed with the warships to replenish their exhausted bunkers in the old days of sailing vessels their motive power even if fitful was inexhaustible but now that steam reigns supreme as the mover of the world's floating forts the problem of keeping the sea has become in one way very much more complicated the radius of a vessel's action is limited by the capacity of her coal bunkers her captain in war time would be perpetually perplexed by the question of fuel since movement is essential to naval success while any misjudged fast steaming in pursuit of the enemy might render his ship an inert mass incapable of motion because the coal supplies had given out; or at least might compel him to return for supplies to the nearest port at a slow speed losing valuable time illustration a temperleymiller marine cableway coaling hms trafalgar at sea a carrier from which are slung the sacks of coal is hauled backwards and forwards by steel ropes stretching between the foremast of the transport and a mast rigged on the warship just as a competitor in a longdistance race takes his nourishment without halting so should a battleship be able to coal on the wing the task of transferring so many tons of the mineral from one ship's hold to that of another may seem easy enough to the inexperienced critic and under favourable conditions it might not be attended by great difficulty why someone may say you have only to bring the collier alongside the warship make her fast and heave out the coals in a perfect calm this might be feasible; but let the slightest swell arise and then how the sides of the two craft would bump together with dire results to the weaker party! actual tests have shown this at present broadside coaling is considered impracticable but the from bow to stern method has passed through its initial stages and after many failures has reached a point of considerable efficiency the difficulties in transferring coal from a collier to a warship by which she is being towed will be apparent after very little reflection in the first place there is the danger of the cableway and its load dipping into the water should the distance between the two vessels be suddenly diminished and the corresponding danger of the cable snapping should the pitching of the vessels increase the distance between the terminals of the cableway these difficulties have made it impossible to merely shoot coals down a rope attached high up a mast of the collier and to the deck of the warship what is evidently needed is some system which shall pay the cableway out or take it in automatically so as to counterbalance any lengthening or shortening movement of the vessels the lidgerwood manufacturing company of new york under the direction of mr spencer miller have brought out a cableway specially adapted for marine work the two vessels concerned are attached by a stout towline the collier of course being in the rear to carry the load a single endless wire rope inch in diameter and feet long is employed it spans the distance between collier and ship twice giving an inward track for full sacks and an outward track for their return to the collier on one vessel are two winches the drums of which both turn in the same direction; but while one drum is rigidly attached to its axle the other slips under a stress greater than that needed to keep the rope sufficiently taut since the rope passes round a pulley at the other terminal pressure placed at any point on the rope will tend to tighten both tracks while a slackening at any point would similarly ease them supposing then that the ships suddenly approach there will be a certain amount of slack at once wound in; if on the other hand the ships draw apart the slipping drum will pay out rope sufficient to supply the need the constant slipping of this drum sets up great heat which is dissipated by currents of air as the sacks of coal arrive on the manofwar they are automatically detached from the cable and fall down a chute into the hold in the temperley miller marine cableway the load is carried on a main cable kept taut by a friction drum and the hauling is done by an endless rope which has its own separate winches in actual tests made at sea in rough weather sixty tons per hour have been transferred the vessels moving at from four to eight miles an hour footnotes  cassier's magazine  cassier's magazine chapter xviii automatic weighers  scarcely less important than the rapid transference of materials from one place to another is the quick and accurate weighing of the same if a pneumatic grain elevator were used in conjunction with an ordinary set of scales such as are to be found at a corn dealer's there would be great delay and the advantage of the elevator would largely be lost similarly a mechanical transporter of coal or ore should automatically register the tonnage of the mineral handled to prevent undue waste of time there are in existence many types of automatic weighing machines the general principles of which vary with the nature of the commodity to be weighed finely divided substances such as grain seeds and sugar are usually handled by hopper weighers the grain etc is passed into a bin from the bottom of which it flows into a large pan when the proper unit of weighta hundredweight or a tonhas nearly been attained the flow is automatically throttled so that it may be more exactly controlled and as soon as the full amount has passed the machine closes the hopper door and tips the pan over the latter delivers its contents and returns to its original position while the door above is simultaneously opened for the operation to be repeated a counting apparatus records the number of tips so that a glance suffices to learn how much material has passed through the weigher which may be locked up and allowed to look after itself for hours together the chronos automatic grain scale is built in many sizes for charges of from to lbs of grain and tips five times a minute avery's grain weigher takes up to tons at a time for materials of a lumpy nature such as coal and ore a different method is generally used the hopper process would not be absolutely accurate since the rate of feed cannot be exactly controlled when dust and large lumps weighing half a hundredweight or more are all jumbled together therefore instead of a pan which tips automatically as soon as it has received a fixed weight we find a bin which when a quantity roughly equal to the correct amount has been let in sinks on to a weigher and has its contents registered by an automatic counter which continuously adds up the total of a number of weighings and displays it on a dial so that if there be lbs in excess of a ton at the first charge the dial records one ton and keeps the lbs up its sleeve against the next weighing to which the excess is added avery's mineral scale works however on much the same principle as that for grain already noticed a special device being fitted to render the feed to the weighing pan as regular as possible his weigher is used to feed mechanical furnace stokers the quantity of coal used can thus be checked while an automatic apparatus prevents the stoker bunkers from being overfilled continuous weighers register the amount carried by a conveyer while in motion the recording apparatus comes into action at fixed intervals eg as soon as the conveyer has moved ten feet the weighing mechanism is practically part of the conveyer and takes the weight of ten feet the steelyard is adjusted to exactly counterbalance the unloaded belt or skips of its length but rises in proportion to the load as soon as the conveyer has travelled ten feet the weight on the machine is immediately recorded and the steelyard returns to zero intermittent weighers record the weight of trucks or tubs passing over a railway or the cables of aerial track the weigher forming part of the track and coming into play as soon as a load is fully on it some machines not only weigh material but also stow and pack it we find a good instance in timewell's sacking apparatus which weighs corn chaff flour oatmeal rice coffee etc transfers it to sacks and sews the sack up automatically the amount of time saved by such a machine must be very great notethe author desires to express his indebtedness to mr george f zimmer's the mechanical handling of material for some of the information contained in the above chapter; and to the publishers messrs a crosby lockwood and son for permission to make use of the same chapter xix transporter bridges  when the writer was in rouen in two lofty iron towers were being constructed by the seine the one on the quai du havre the other on the quai capelier which borders the river on the side of the suburb st sever the towers rose so far towards the sky that one had to throw one's head very far back to watch the workmen perched on the summit of the framework what were the towers for? they seemed much too slender for the piers of an ordinary suspension bridge fit to carry heavy traffic an inquiry produced the information that they were the first instalment of a transbordeur or transporter bridge what is a bridge of this kind? well it may best be described as a very lofty suspension bridge the girder of which is far above the water to allow the passage of masted ships the suspended girder serves only as the runway for a truck from which a travelling car hangs by stout steel ropes the bottom of the car being but a few feet above the water the truck is carried across from tower to tower either by electric motors or by cables operated by steampower the transporter bridge in a primitive form has existed for some centuries but its present design is of very modern growth with the increase of population has come an increased need for uninterrupted communication where rivers intervene they must be bridged and we see a steady growth in the number of bridges in london paris new york and other large towns unfortunately a bridge while joining land to land separates water from water and the dislocation of river traffic might not be compensated by the conveniences given to land traffic the forth brooklyn saltash and other bridges have therefore been built of such a height as to leave sufficient headroom under the girders for the masts of the tallest ships but what money they have cost! and even the tower bridge with its hinged bascules or leaves and bridges with centres revolving horizontally devour large sums wanted therefore an efficient means of transport across a river which though not costly to install shall offer a good service and not impede river traffic thirty years ago mr charles smith a hartlepool engineer designed a bridge of the transporter type for crossing the tees at middlesbrough the bridge was not built because people feared that the towers would not stand the buffets of the northeasterly gales the idea promulgated by an englishman was taken up by foreign engineers who have erected bridges in spain tunis and france so successful has this type of ferrybridge proved that it is now receiving recognition in the land of its birth and at the present time transporter bridges are nearing completion in wales and on the mersey illustration the latest type of bridge the transporter bridge at bizerta tunis it has a span of feet and the suspension girder is feet above high water so that the largest vessels may pass under it from the mediterranean to the inland lakes the car is seen near the bottom of the righthand tower the first transbordeur built was that spanning the nervion a river flowing into the bay of biscay near bilbao a spanish town famous for the great deposits of iron ore close by a pair of towers rises on each bank to a height of feet and carry a suspended trussed girder feet long at a level of feet above highwater mark the car giving accommodation for passengers it does not handle vehicles hangs on the end of cables feet long and is propelled by a steamengine situated in one of the towers motion is controlled by the carconductor who is connected electrically with the engineroom the lofty towers are supported on the landward side by stout steel ropes firmly anchored in the ground these ropes are carried over the girder in the familiar curve of the suspension bridge and attached to it at regular intervals by vertical steel braces the cost of the bridge£compares favourably with that of any alternative nontrafficblocking scheme and the graceful airy lines of the erection are by no means a blot on the landscape the second transbordeur is that of rouen already referred to its span is rather less feetbut the suspension girder lies higher by feet the car is feet long by broad and weighs with a full load tons a passage which occupies seconds costs one penny first class one halfpenny second class; while a vehicle and horses pay d to d according to weight the car is propelled by electricity under the control of a man in the conningtower perched on the roof at bizerta we find the third flyingferry which connects that town with tunis over a narrow channel between the mediterranean sea and two inland lakes it replaced a steamferry which had done duty for about ten years the lakes being an anchorage for war vessels it was imperative that any bridge over the straits should not interrupt free ingress and egress this bridge has a span of feet and like that at bilbao is worked by steam light as the structure appears it has withstood a cyclone which did great damage in the neighbourhood it is reported that the french government has decided to remove the bridge to some other port because its prominence would make it serve as a rangefinder for an enemy's cannon in time of war its place would be taken either by a floatingbridge or by a submarine tunnel the nantes transporter over the loire differs from its fellows in one respect viz that it is built on the cantilever or balance principle instead of a single girder spanning the space between the towers it has three girders the two end ones being balanced on the towers and anchored at their landward extremities by vertical cables the gap between them is bridged by a third girder of bow shape which is stiff enough in itself to need no central support the motive power is electricity all these structures will soon be eclipsed by two english bridges the one over the usk at newport monmouthshire; the other over the mersey and manchester ship canal at runcorn gap where the river narrows to feet the first of these has towers feet high and feet apart the girders will give feet headroom above highwater mark five hundred passengers will be able to travel at one time on the car besides a number of road vehicles and as the passage is calculated to take only one minute the average velocity will exceed eight miles an hour the cost has been set down at £ or about onethirtieth that of a suspension bridge and onethird that of a bascule bridge the bridge is being built by the french engineers responsible for the rouen transbordeur coming to the much more imposing runcorn bridge we find even these figures exceeded this span is feet in length the designer mr john j webster has already made a name with the great wheel which at earl's court london has given many thousands of pleasureseekers an aerial trip above the roofs of the metropolis the following account by mr w g archer in the magazine of commerce describes this mammoth of its kind in some detail the two main towers carrying the cables and the stiffening girders are built one on the south side of the ship canal and the other on the foreshore on the north bank of the river; and the approaches consist of new roadways nearly flat built between stone and concrete retaining walls as far as the water's edge and a corrugated steel flooring upon which are laid the timber blocks on concrete resting on steel elliptical girders and castiron columns the roadway in front of the towers is widened out to feet for marshalling the traffic and for providing space for waitingrooms etc the towers are constructed wholly of steel rise feet above highwater level and are bolted firmly to the castiron cylinders below each tower consists of four legs spaced feet apart at the base and each pair of towers are feet apart and are braced together with strong horizontal and diagonal frames each of the two main cables consists of steel ropes bound together each rope being built up of wires · inches in diameter the ends of the cable backstays are anchored into the solid rock on each side of the river about feet from the rock surface the weight of the main cables is about tons and from them are suspended two longitudinal stiffening girders feet deep and placed feet apart horizontally the underside of the girders being feet above the level of high water upon the lower flange of the stiffening girders are fixed the rails upon which runs the traveller from which is suspended the car the traveller is feet long and is carried by sixteen wheels on each rail it is propelled by two electric motors of about horsepower each the car will be capable of holding at one time four large wagons and passengers the latter being protected from the weather by a glazed shelter the time occupied by the car in crossing will be minutes so allowing for the time spent in loading and unloading it will be capable of making nine or ten trips per hour this bridge when completed will have the largest span of any bridge in the united kingdom designed for carrying road traffic the clear space over the mersey and ship canal being feet the total cost of the structure including parliamentary expenses will be about £ mr archer adds that in spite of prophecies of disastrous collisions between transporter cars and passing ships there has up to date been no accident of any kind to those in search of a new sensation the experience of skimming swiftly a few feet above the water may be recommended chapter xx boat and ship raising lifts  in modern locomotion whether by land or water it becomes increasingly necessary to keep the way unobstructed where traffic is confined to the narrow limits of a pair of rails a road or a canal channel we widen our roads; we double and quadruple our rails canals are as a rule not alterable except at immense cost; and if in the first instance they were not built broad enough for the work that they are afterwards called upon to do much of their business must pass to rival methods of transportation modern canals such as the manchester and kiel canals were given generous proportions to start with as their purpose was to pass oceangoing ships and for many years it will not be necessary to enlarge them the suez canal has been widened in recent years by means of dredgers which easily scoop out the sandy soil through which it runs and deposit it on the banks but the corinth canal cut through solid rock cannot be thus economically expanded and as a result it has proved a commercial failure even if a canal be of full capacity in its channelway there are points at which its traffic is throttled however gently the country it traverses may slope there must occur at intervals the necessity of making a lock for transferring vessels from one level to the other sometimes the ascent or descent is effected by a series of steps or flight of locks on account of the magnitude of the fall; and in such cases the loss of time becomes a serious addition to the cost of transport in several instances engineers have got over the difficulty by ingenious hydraulic lifts which in a few minutes pass a boat through a perpendicular distance of many feet at anderton where the trent and mersey canal meets the weaver navigation barges up to tons displacement are raised fifty feet two troughs each weighing with their contents tons are carried by two castiron rams placed under their centres the cylinders of which are connected by piping when both troughs are full the pressure on the rams is equal and no movement results; but if six inches of water be transferred from the one to the other the heavier at once forces up the lighter at fontinettes on the neufosse canal in france at la louvière in belgium and at peterborough in canada similar installations are found; the last handling vessels of tons through a rise of feet fine engineering feats as these are they do not equal the canallift on the dortmundems canal which puts dortmund in direct water communication with the elbe and opens the coal and iron deposits of the rhine and upper silesia to the busy manufacturing district lying between these two localities about ten miles from its eastern extremity the main reach of the canal forks off at heinrichenburg from the northward branch running to dortmund its level being on the average some feet lower than the branch for the transference of boats an up and down line of four locks each would have been needed; and apart from the inevitable two hours' delay for locking this method would have entailed the loss of a great quantity of precious water mr r gerdau a prominent engineer of düsseldorfgrafenburg therefore suggested an hydraulic lift which should accommodate boats of tons and pass them from the one level to the other in five minutes this scheme was approved and has recently been completed the principle of the lift is as followsa trough feet long rests on five vertical supports themselves carried by as many hollow cylindrical floats moving up and down in deep wells full of water the buoyancy of the five floats is just equal to the combined weight of the trough and its load so that a comparatively small force causes the latter to rise or fall as required by letting off water from the troughwhich is of course furnished with doors to seal its endsit would be made to ascend; while the addition of a few tons would cause a descent but this would mean waste of water; and were the trough not otherwise governed a serious accident might happen if a float sprang a leak motion is therefore imparted to the trough by four huge vertical screws resting on solid masonry piers and turning in large collars attached to the trough near its corners all the screws work in unison through gearing as they are sufficiently stout to bear the whole load; even were the floats removed no tilting or sudden fall is possible the screws are driven by an electric motor of horsepower perched on the girders joining the tops of four steel towers which act as guides for the trough to move in while they absorb all windpressure under normal circumstances the trough rises or sinks at a speed of four inches per second the total mass in motiontrough water boat and floatsis tons our ideas of a float do not ordinarily rise above the small cork which we take with us when we go afishing or at the most above the buoy which bobs up and down to mark a fairway these five floatsso calledbelong to a very much larger class of creations each is feet across inside and feet high their wells feet deep are lined with concrete nearly a yard thick to ensure absolute watertightness inside the stout iron casings which rise feet above the bottom in view of the immense weight which they have to carry the piers under the screwspindles are extremely solid at its base each measures feet by feet inches and tapers upwards for feet till these dimensions have contracted to feet inches by feet inches the spindles feet long and inches in diameter must be four of the largest screws in existence to make it absolutely certain that they contained no flaws a inch central hole was drilled through them longitudinallyanother considerable workshop feat if shafts of such length were left unsupported when the trough was at its highest point there would be danger of their bending and breaking; and they are therefore provided with four sliding collars each connected each to its fellow by a rod when the trough has risen a fifth of its travel the first rod lifts the first collar which moves in the guidepillars this in turn raises the second; the second the third; and so on so that by the time the trough is fully raised each spindle is kept in line by four intermediate supports the trough feet long by feet wide will receive a vessel feet long between perpendiculars it has a rectangular section and is built up of stout plates laid on strong crossgirders all carried by a single huge longitudinal girder resting on the float columns one of the most difficult problems inseparable from a structure of this kind is the provision of a watertight joint between the trough and the upper and lower reaches of the canal at each end of the trough is a sliding door faced on its outer edges with indiarubber which the pressure of the water inside holds tightly against flanges when pressure on the outside is removed the termination of the canal reaches have similar doors; but as it would be impossible to arrange things so accurately that the two sets of flanges should be watertight a wedge shaped like a big u and faced on both sides with rubber is interposed the wedge at the lower reach gate is thickest at the bottom; the upper wedge the reverse; so that the trough in both cases jams it tight as it comes to rest the wedges can be raised or lowered in accordance with the fluctuations of the canals after thus briefly outlining the main constructional features of the lift let us watch a boat pass through from the lower to the upper level it is a steamer of tons burden quite a formidable craft to meet so far inland; while some distance away it blows a warning whistle and the motorman at his post moves a lever which sets the screw in motion the trough sinks until it has reached the proper level when the current is automatically broken and it sinks no further its travel is thus controllable to within of an inch an interlocking arrangement makes it impossible to open the trough or reach gates until the trough has settled or risen to the level of the water outside on the other hand the motor driving the lifting screws cannot be started until the gates have been closed so that an accidental flooding of the countryside is amply provided against a man now turns the crank of a winch on the canal bank and unlocks the canal gate a second twist couples the gates between the canal and the trough together and starts the liftingmotors overhead which raise the twentyeight ton mass twentythree feet clear of the

world and the novelty of its design will it is hoped render the above account acceptable to the reader before leaving the subject another canal lift may be noticedthat on the grand junction canal at foxton leicestershirewhich has replaced a system of ten locks to raise barges through a height of feet the new method is the invention of messrs g and c b j thomas in principle it consists of an inclined railway having eight rails four for the up and as many for the down traffic on each set of four rails runs a tank mounted on eight wheels which is connected with a similar tank on the other set by inch steelwire ropes passing round winding drums at the top of the incline the tanks are thus balanced at the foot of the incline a barge which has to ascend is floated into whichever tank may be ready to receive it and the end gate is closed an engine is then started and the laden tank slides broadside on up the foot slope the summit being reached the tank gates are brought into register with those of the upper reach and as soon as they have been opened the boat floats out into the upper canal boats of tons can be thus transferred in about twelve minutes at a cost of but a few pence

of lift for raising ships out of the waterthe floating dry dockelsewhere so his remarks in this place will be confined to mechanism which having its foundations on mother earth heaves mighty vessels out of their proper element by the force of hydraulic pressure looking round for a good example of an hydraulic shiplift we select that of the union ironworks san francisco some years ago the works were moved from the heart of the city to the edge of mission bay with the object of carrying on a large business in marine engineering and shipbuilding for such a purpose a dry dock which in a short time will lift a vessel clear of the water for cleaning or repairs is of great importance to both owners and workmen by the courtesy of the proprietors of cassier's magazine we are allowed to append the following account of this interesting lift the site available for a dock at the union ironworks was a mudflat the depth of soft mud being from to feet would render the working of a graving dock ie one dug out of the ground and pumped dry when the entrance doors have been closed very disagreeable; as such docks where much mud is carried in with the water require a long time to be cleaned and to dry out plans were therefore prepared by mr george w dickie for an hydraulic dock including an automatic control which the designer felt confident would meet all the requirements of the situation and which after careful consideration the union ironworks decided to build work was begun in january and the dock was opened for business on june th a very fine record this dock consists of a platform built of cross and longitudinal steel girders feet wide and feet long having keel blocks and sliding bilge blocks upon which the ship to be lifted rests the lifting power is generated by a set of four steamdriven singleacting horizontal plunger pumps the diameter of the plungers being inches and the stroke inches forty strokes per minute is the regular speed there is a weighted accumulator or regulator connected with the pumps the throttle valve of the engines being controlled by the accumulator the load on the accumulator consists of a number of flat discs of metal the first one about inches thick and the others about inches thick the diameter being about feet the first disc gives a pressure of lbs per square inch this is sufficient to lift the dock platform without a ship and is always kept on in lifting a ship as she comes out of the water and gets heavier on the platform additional discs are taken on by the accumulator ram as required the discs are suspended by pins on the side catching into links of a chain the engineer to take on another disc unhooks the throttle from the accumulator rod runs the engine a little above the normal speed the accumulator rises and takes the weight of the disc to be added; the link carrying that disc is thus relieved and is withdrawn the engineer again hooks the accumulator rod to the engine throttle and the whole is selfacting again until another weight is required when all the discs are on the ram the full pressure of lbs per square inch is reached which enables a ship of tons weight to be raised there are eighteen hydraulic rams on each side of the dock these rams are each inches in diameter and have a stroke of feet; and as the platform rises feet for foot movement of the rams the total vertical movement of the platform is feet when lowered to the lowest limit there are feet of water over the keel blocks at high tide the foundations consist of seventytwo cylinders of iron which extend from the top girders to several feet below the mud line these cylinders are driven full of piles no pile being shorter than feet the cylinders are to protect the piles from the teredo the timberboring worm which is very destructive in san francisco harbour a heavy castiron cap completes each of the foundation piers and two heavy steel girders extend the full length of the dock on each side resting on the foundation piers and uniting them all longitudinally the hydraulic cylinders are carried by large castings resting on the girders each having a central opening to receive a cylinder which passes down between the piers there are thirtysix foundation piers and eighteen hydraulic cylinders on each side of the dock on the top of each hydraulic ram is a heavy sheave or pulley feet in diameter over which pass eight steel cables inches in diameter making in all cables one end of each cable is anchored in the bedplates supporting the hydraulic cylinders while the other end is secured to the side girders of the platform each of the cables has been tested with a load of tons so that the total test load for the ropes has been tons in lifting a ship the load is never evenly distributed on the platform there is in fact often more than one ship on the platform at once some rams therefore may have a full load and others much less under these conditions to keep the platform a true plane irrespective of the irregular distribution of the load mr dickie designed a special valve gear to make the action of the dock perfectly automatic down each side of the dock a shaft is carried operated by a special engine in the power house at each hydraulic ram this shaft carries a worm gearing with a wormwheel on a vertical screw extending the full height reached by the stroke of the ram this screw works in a nut on the end of a lever the other end of which is attached to the ram between the two points of support a rod working the valvesalso carried by the ramengages with the lever if at a given moment the screwend is raised say six inches the lever opens the valve as the ram rises the lever having its other end similarly lifted by the rise gradually assumes a horizontal position and the valve closes to lift the dock the engine working the valve shaft is started and with it the operating screws these through the levers open the inlet valves the rams now begin to move up if any one has a light load it will move up ahead of the other but in doing so it lifts the other end of the lever and closes the valve in fact the screws are continually opening the valves while the motion of the rams is continually closing them so that no ram can move ahead of its screw and the speed of the screw determines the rate of movement of the lifting platform to lower the dock the engine operating the valve shaft is reversed and the screws and levers then control the outlet valves as they controlled the inlet valves in raising when the platform has reached the limit of its movement a line of locks on top of the foundation girders thirtysix on each side are pushed under the platform by an hydraulic cylinder and the platform is lowered on to them where it rests until the work is done on the ship; then the platform is again lifted the locks are drawn back and the platform with its load is lowered until the ship floats out all the operations are automatic since the dock was opened well over a thousand ships have been lifted in it without any accident whatever; the total register tonnage approaching the great favour in which the dock is held by shipowners and captains is partly due to the fact already mentioned that the ship is lifted above the level of tide water where the air can circulate freely under the bottom thus quickly taking up all the moisture and where the workmen can carry on operations with greater comfort when extensive repairs have to be undertaken on iron or steel vessels the fact that this dock forms part of an extensive shipbuilding plant and is located right in the yard enables such repairs to be executed with despatch and economy several large steamships have had the underwater portions of their hulls practically rebuilt in this dock the steamship columbia of the oregon line had practically a new bottom including the whole of the keel completed in twentysix days this is possible because every facility is alongside the dock and the bottom of the vessel is on a level with the yard this being the only hydraulic dock controlled automatically in it has attracted a large amount of attention from engineering experts in this class of work english french german and russian engineers have visited the union iron works to study its working and their reports have done much to bring the facilities offered to shipping for repairs by the union iron works to the notice of shipowners all the world over footnotes  the romance of modern engineering pp foll  for explanation of the accumulator see the chapter on hydraulic tools p chapter xxi a selfmoving staircase  at the american exhibition held in the crystal palace in there was shown a staircase which on payment of a penny transported any sufficiently daring person from the groundfloor to the gallery above all that the experimenters had to do was to step boldly on take hold of the balustrade which moved at an equal pace with the stairs and step off when the upper level was reached the escalator latin scalae = flight of stairs hails from the united states where it is proving a serious rival to the elevator in principle it is a continuously working lift the slow travel of which is more than compensated by the fact that it is always available the ordinary elevator is very useful in a large business or commercial house where it saves the legs of people who if they had to tramp up flight after flight of stairs would probably not spend so much money as they would be ready to part with if their vertical travel from one floor to another was entirely free of effort but the ordinary lift is like a railway intermittent we all know what it means to stand at the grille and watch the cage slide downwards on its journey of perhaps four floors when we want to go to a floor higher up rather than face the delay we use our legs theoretically therefore a large emporium should contain at least two lifts if the number be further increased the wouldbe passenger will have a still better chance of getting off at once thus at the station of the central london railway we have to wait but a very few seconds before a grille is thrown back and an attendant invites us to hurry up there please! yet there is delay while the cage is being filled the actual journey occupies but a small fraction of the time which elapses between the moment when the first passenger enters the lift at the one end of the trip and the moment when the last person leaves it at the other end in a building where the lift stops every fifteen feet or so to take people on or put them off the waste of time is still more accentuated the escalator is always ready you step on and are transported one stage a second staircase takes you on at once if you desire it there is no delay furthermore the room occupied by a single escalator is much less than that occupied by the number of lifts required to give anything like an equally efficient service in large american stores then it is coming into favour and also on the manhattan elevated railway of new york when once the little nervousness accompanying the first use has worn off it eclipses the lift a writer in cassier's magazine says in one large retail store during the holiday season more than persons per hour have been carried upon the escalator for five hours of the day and the aggregate for an entire day is believed to be in the same store on an ordinary day the passengers alighting at the second floor from the eight large lifts which run from the basement to the fifth floor were counted likewise the number at the escalator this latter was found to be per cent of the number delivered by the eight lifts in another establishment in a very busy hour the number taken from the first floor by the escalator was four times the number taken from the first floor by the fourteen lifts which were running at their maximum capacity to the merchant this spells opportunity for business the experience at the twentythird street and sixth avenue station of the manhattan elevated railway in new york during a recent shutdown of the escalator which has been in service for some time is interesting as showing the attitude of the public of which many millions have been carried by the installation during the several years of its operation the daily traffic receipts of this station for a period beginning several weeks before the shutdown and extending as many after for the years and and receipts of the adjacent stations for the same period were carefully plotted and the loss area during the period of shutdown was determined the loss area was found to embrace fares it was furthermore daily a matter of observation that numbers of people finding that the escalator was not running refused to climb the stairs and turned away from the station in the case of a great store the escalator may be constructed as one continuous machine with landings at each floor and so arranged that steps which carry passengers up may perform a like service in carrying others down; or separate machines may be installed in various locations affording the best opportunity for displaying merchandise to the customer who may be proceeding from the lower to the upper floor in the case of a sixstorey building so equipped with escalator service in both directions or in all ten escalator flights it is obvious that the facilities are equal to an impossible number of elevators; and as facility of access has a direct bearing upon opportunities for business it may well be argued that the relative value measured by rent of the main and upper floors is greatly changed each step in a staircase has two partsthe tread or horizontal board on which the foot is placed and the vertical riser which acts both as a support to the tread above and also prevents the foot from slipping under the tread in the escalator each tread is attached rigidly to its riser and the two together form an independent unit for the convenience of passengers in stepping on or off at the upper and lower landings the treads in these places are all in the same horizontal plane as they approach the incline the risers gradually appear and the treads separate vertically at the top of the incline the process is gradually reversed the risers disappearing until the treads once more form a horizontal belt the means of effecting this change is most ingenious each tread and its riser is carried on a couple of vertical triangular brackets one at each side of the staircase the base of the bracket is uppermost to engage with the tread and its apex has a hole through which passes a transverse bar which in its central part forms a pin in the linkchain by which power is transmitted to the escalator naturally the step would tip over this is prevented by a yoke attached to each end of the bar at right angles to it and parallel to the tread the yoke has at each extremity a small wheel running on its own railthere being two rails for each side of the staircase since step brackets bar and yoke are all rigidly joined together the step is unable to leave the horizontal but its relation to the steps above and below is determined by the arrangement of the rails on which the yoke wheels run when these are in the same plane all the yokes and consequently the treads will also be in the same plane but at the incline where the inner rail gradually sinks lower than its fellow the front wheel of one tread is lower than the front wheel of the next and the risers appear it may be added that owing to the double track at each side of the staircase the back wheel of one tread does not interfere with the front wheel of that below; and that on the level they come abreast without jostling as the yoke is bent the chain of which the stepbars form pins travels under the centre of the staircase it is made up of links eighteen inches long having in addition to the bars a number of steel crosspins inches in diameter their axes three inches apart so that the chain as a whole has a threeinch pitch the hubs of the links are bushed with bronze and have a graphite inlay which makes them selflubricating every joint is turned to within inch of absolute accuracy the tracks are of steel and hardwood insulated from the ironwork which supports them by sheets of rubber the wheels are so constructed as to be practically noiseless so that as a whole the escalator works very quietly it has been observed says the authority already quoted that beginners take pains to step upon a single tread and that after a little experience no attention whatever is given to the footing owing to the facility of adapting oneself to the situation the upper landing is somewhat longer thereby affording an interval for stepping off at either side of sufficient duration to meet the requirements of the aged and infirm the sole function of the travelling landing is to provide a time interval to meet the requirements of the slowestacting passenger and not of the alert the terminal of the exit landing be it top or bottom for the escalator operates equally well for either ascent or descent is a barrier called the shunt of which the lower member travels horizontally in a plane oblique to the direction of movement of the steps and at a speed proportionately greater thereby imparting a rightangle resultant to the person or obstacle on the step which may come in contact with the shunt by reason of this resultant motion the person or obstacle is gently pushed off the end of the step upon the floor without shock or injury in the slightest degree the motion of the escalator is so smooth and constant that it does not interpose the least obstacle to the free movement of the passenger who may walk in either direction or assume any attitude to the same degree as upon a stationary staircase at cleveland usa there has been erected a rolling roadway consisting of an inclined endless belt and platform made of planks eight feet long placed transversely across the roadway the timbers are fastened together in trucks of two planks each adjoining trucks being joined by heavy links to form a moving roadway which runs on small wheels at each end the roadway which is continuous passes round enormous rollers its total length is feet and the rise feet four electric motors placed at regular intervals along its length and all controlled by one man at the head of the incline drive it at three miles an hour it can accommodate six wagons at a time chapter xxii pneumatic mail tubes  you put your money on the counter the shop assistant makes out a bill; and you wonder what he will do with it next these large stores know nothing of an open till yet there are no cashiers' desks visible; nor any overhead wires to whisk a carrier off to some corner where a young lady enthroned in a box controls all the pecuniary affairs of that department while you are wondering the assistant has wrapped the coin in the bill and put the two into a dumbbellshaped carrier which he drops into a hole a few seconds later flop! and the carrier has returned into a basket under another opening there is something so mysterious about the operation that you ask questions and it is explained to you that there are pneumatic tubes running from every counter in the building to a central paydesk on the first or second floor; and that an engine somewhere in the basement is hard at work all day compressing air to shoot the carriers through their tubes certainly a great improvement on those croquetball receptacles which progressed with a deliberation maddening to anyone in a hurry along a wooden suspended railway! now imagine tubes of this sort only of much larger diameter in some cases passing for miles under the streets and houses and you will have an idea of what the pneumatic mail despatch means the cash and bill being replaced by letters telegrams and possibly small parcels swift as the wind is a phrase often in our mouths when we wish to emphasise the celerity of an individual an animal or a machine in getting from one spot of the earth's surface to another mercury the messenger of uncertaintempered jove was pictured with wings on his feet to convey symbolically the same notion of speed the modern human messenger is so poor a counterpart of the god and his feet are so far from being winged that for certain purposes we have fallen back on elemental aircurrents not unrestrained like the breezes but confined to the narrow and certain paths of the metal tube the pneumatic despatch which at the present day is by no means universal has been tried in various forms for several decades its first public installation dates from when a tube three inches in diameter and yards long was laid in london to connect the international telegraph company with the stock exchange a vacuum was created artificially in front of the carrier which the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere forced through the tube soon after this the postoffice authorities took the matter up as the pneumatic system promised to be useful for the transmission of letters; but refused to face the initial expense of laying the tube lines when in mr c f varley introduced the high pressure method pneumatic despatch received an impetus comparable to that given to the steamengine by the employment of highpressure steam it was now possible to use a double line of tubes economically the air compressed for sending the carriers through the one line being pumped out of a chamber which sucked them back through the other tubes for postal work were soon installed in many large towns in great britain europe and the united states; including the thirtyinch pneumatic railway between the northwestern district post office in eversholt street and euston station which for some months of transported the mails between these two points the air was exhausted in front of the carriage by a large fan encouraged by its success the company built a much larger tube nearly feet in diameter to connect euston station with the general post office this carried fourteen tons of postoffice matter from one end to the other in a quarter of an hour there was an intermediate station in holborn where the engines for exhausting had been installed but owing to the difficulty of preventing air leakage round the carriages the undertaking proved a commercial failure and for years the very route of this pneumatic railway could not be found; so quickly are failures forgotten! the more useful small tube grew most vigorously in america and france in or about the year the western union telegraph company laid tubes in new york to despatch telegrams from one part of the city to the other because they found it quicker to send them this way than over the wires eighteen years later fifteen miles of tubes were installed in chicago to connect the main offices of the same company with the newspaper offices in the town and with various important public buildings messages which formerly took an hour or more in delivery are now flipped from end to end in a few seconds the philadelphia people meanwhile had been busy with a double line of sixinch tubes feet long laid by mr b c batcheller between the bourse and the general post office for the carriage of mails the first thing to pass through was a bible wrapped in the stars and stripes a horsepower engine is kept busy exhausting and compressing the air needed for the service which amounts to about cubic feet per minute philadelphia can also boast an eightinch service connecting the general post office with the union railway station a mile away one and a half minutes suffice for the transit of the large carriers packed tightly with letters and circulars nearly half a million of which are handled by these tubes daily new york is equally well served tubes run from the general post office to the produce exchange to brooklyn and to the grand central station the last is miles distant; but seven minutes only are needed for a tube journey which formerly occupied the mail vans for nearly threequarters of an hour paris is the city of the petit bleu so important an institution in the gay capital here a network of tubes connects every post office in the urban area with a central bureau acting the part of a telephone exchange if you want to send an express message to a friend anywhere in paris you buy a petit bleu ie a very thin lettercard not exceeding oz in weight at the nearest post office and post it in a special box it whirls away to the exchange and is delivered from there if its destination be close at hand; otherwise it makes a second journey to the office most conveniently situated for delivery everybody uses the voie pneumatique of paris so much cheaper than and quite as expeditious as the telegraph; with the additional advantage that all messages are transmitted in the sender's own handwriting the system has been instituted for a quarter of a century and the parisians would feel lost without it london is by no means tubeless for it has over forty miles of  and inch lines radiating from the postal nervecentre of the metropolis of lengths ranging from to yards the tubes are in all cases composed of lead enclosed in a protecting iron piping to make a joint great care must be exercised so as to avoid any irregularity of bore when a length of piping is added to the line a chain is first passed through it which has at the end a bright steel mandrel just a shade larger than the pipe's internal diameter this is heated and pushed halfway into the pipe already laid; and the new length is forced on to the other half till the ends touch a plumber's joint having been made the mandrel is drawn by the chain through the new length obliterating any dents or malformations in the interior the main lines are doubledan up and a down track; short branches have one tube only to work the inward and the outward despatches the carriers are made of guttapercha covered with felt one end is closed by felt discs fitting the tube accurately to prevent the passage of air the other is open for the introduction of messages as they fly through the tube the carriers work an automatic signalling apparatus which tells how far they have progressed and when it will be safe to despatch the next carrier the london postoffice system is worked by six large engines situated in the basement of the general post office so useful has the pneumatic tube proved that a bill has been before parliament for supplying london with a inch network of tubes totalling miles of double line in a letter published in the times april  the promoters of the scheme give a succinct account of their intentions and of the benefits which they expect to accrue from the scheme if brought to completion the batcheller system they write with which it is proposed to equip london is not a development of the miniature systems used for telegrams or single letters here or in paris berlin and other cities such systems deal with a felt carrier weighing a few ounces which is stopped by being blown into a box the batcheller system deals with a loaded steel carrier weighing seventy pounds travelling with a very high momentum the difference is fundamental in this sense pneumatic tubes are a recent invention and absolutely new to europe the batcheller system is the response to a pressing need careful observations show that more than per cent of the street traffic is occupied with parcels and mails these form a distinct class differentiated from passengers on the one hand and from heavy goods on the other the batcheller system will do for parcels and mails what the underground electric railways do for passengers it has been in use for twelve years in america for mail purposes and where used has come to be regarded as indispensable the plan for london provides for nearly one hundred miles of double tubes with about twice that number of stations for receiving and delivery the system will cover practically the county of london and no point within that area can be more than onequarter of a mile from a tube station beyond the county of london deliveries will be made by a carefully organised suburban motorcart service thirty of the receiving stations are to be established in the large stores the diameter of the tube is to be of a size that will accommodate per cent of the parcels as now wrapped and per cent with slight adaptation the remaining per centfurniture pianos and other heavy goodsare to be dealt with by a supplementary motor service if the tubes were enlarged their object would be partially defeated for with the increased size would go increased cost great surplus of capacity less frequent despatch and lower efficiency generally the unsuccessful euston tunnel of forty years agopractically an underground railwayis an extreme illustration of this point though in that case there were grave mechanical defects as well from a mechanical point of view the system has been brought to such perfection that it is no more experimental than a locomotive or an electric tramcar the unique value of tube service is due to immediate despatch high velocity of transit immunity from traffic interruption and economy the greatest obstacle to rapid intercommunication is the delay resulting from accumulations due to time schedules the function of tube service is to abolish time schedules and all consequent delays the number of trades parcels annually delivered in london is estimated at more than a careful canvass has been made of shops only which represent a very small fraction of the total number in the county as a result it has been ascertained that these shops deliver no fewer than parcels yearly a fact that seems to more than justify the foregoing estimate; on the other hand it is known from official data that the parcel post in london is represented by less than or oneninth of the total parcel traffic with a tube system in operation every parcel instead of waiting for the next delivery would leave the shop immediately after being despatched by the tube it would be delivered at a tube station within a quarter of a mile at least of its destination and thence by messenger the entire time consumed for an ordinary parcel would be not over an hour and for a special parcel fifteen to twenty minutes they require from three to six hours or longer at present the advantages of the tube system to the public would be manifold customers would find their purchases at home upon their return or if they preferred could do their shopping by telephone making their selections from goods sent on approval by tube the shopman would find himself relieved from a vast amount of confusion and annoyance less of his shop space given up to delivery and his expenses reduced small shops would be able to draw upon wholesale houses for goods not in stock while the customer waited such delay and confusion as are frequently occasioned by fogs would be reduced to a minimum while the success of the project is not dependent on post office support the post office should be one of the greatest gainers by it the time of delivery of local letters would be reduced from an average of three hours and six minutes to one hour express letters would be delivered more quickly than telegrams this has been demonstrated conclusively again and again in new york and other american cities where the tubes have been in operation for years the latest time of posting country letters would be deferred from onehalf to one hour and incoming letters would be advanced by a similar period the parcels post would gain in precisely the same way but to an even larger extent if the post office choose to avail themselves of the opportunity every post office will become a tube station and every tube station a post office thus the same number of postmen covering but a tithe of the present distances could make deliveries without time schedules at intervals of a few minutes with a handful instead of a bagful of letters the sorting of mails would be performed at every station instead of at a few incoming country mails would be taken from the bags at the railway termini and the same bags refilled with outgoing country mails thus avoiding needless carriage to the post office and back no bags at all would be used for local mails the steel carriers themselves answering that purpose at every tube terminal a postoffice clerk would be stationed so that the mails would never for an instant be out of postoffice control its absolute security would be further ensured by a system of locking so that the carriers could only be opened by authorised persons at the station to which they were directed these safeguards offer a striking contrast to the present method that entrusts mail bags to the sole custody of van drivers in the employ of private contractors if the mails were handled by tube business men would be able to communicate with each other and receive replies several times in one day and country and foreign letters could always be answered upon the day of receipt the effect would be felt all over the empire would the laying of the tubes seriously impede traffic? the promoters assure us that the inconvenience would not be comparable to that caused by laying a gas water or telephone system when one of those has been laid the annoyance they urge has only begun the streets must be periodically reopened for the purpose of making thousands of house connections extensions and repairs when a pneumatic tube is once down it is good for a generation at least it is not subject to recurrent alterations incidental to house connections and repairs in three american cities the tubes have been touched but three times in twelve years and in those cases the causes were a bursting water main and faulty adjacent electric installations the repairs were effected in a few hours from a general consideration of the scheme we may now turn to some mechanical details the pipes would be of foot internal diameter made in foot lengths straight sections writes an engineering correspondent of the times would be of castiron bored counterbored and turned to a slight taper at one end to fit a recess at the other end of the next tube to form the joints which could be caulked joints made in this way are estimated to permit of a deflection of inches from the straight so that the laying and bedding need not be exact bent sections are to be of seamless brass; these are bored true before bending the permissible curvature is determined upon the basis of a maximum bend of foot radius for every inch of diameter; the foot diameter of the london tubes would consequently be allowed a maximum curvature of foot radius measured at the enlarged end the overall diameter of each pipe is inches and as two such pipes are to be laid side by side with inches between centres the clear width will be inches the trenches are therefore to be cut inches wide and in order to have a comparatively free run for the sections it is proposed to cut the trenches feet deep when the hundred miles of piping have been laid the entire system will be tested to a pressure of lbs to the square inch or about two and a half times the working pressure engines of hp will be required to feed the lines with air for the propulsion of the carriers each feet inches long and weighing lbs in order to ensure the delivery of a carrier at its proper destination whether a terminus or an intermediate station mr batcheller has made a most ingenious provision on the front of a carrier is fixed a metal plate of a certain diameter at each station two electric wires project into the tube and as soon as a plate of sufficient diameter to shortcircuit these wires arrives the current operates delivery mechanism and the carrier is switched off into the station box the despatcher knowing the exact size of disc for each station can therefore make certain that the carrier shall not go astray it may occur to the reader that should a carrier accidentally stick anywhere in the tubes it would be a matter of great difficulty to locate it evidently one could not feel for it with a long rod in half a mile of tubingthe distance between every two stationswith much hope of finding it but science has evolved a simple and at the same time quite reliable method of coping with the problem m bontemps is the inventor he located troubles in the paris tubes by firing a pistol and exactly measuring the time which elapsed between the report and its echo as the rate of sound travel is definitely known instruments of great delicacy enable the necessary calculations to be made with great accuracy when a breakdown occurred on the philadelphia tube line mr batcheller employed this method with great success for a street excavation made on the strength of rough measurements with the timing apparatus came within a few feet of the actual break in the pipe caused by a subsidence while the carriers themselves were found almost exactly at the point where the workmen had been told to begin digging there is no doubt that were such a system as that proposed established an enormous amount of time would be saved to the community a letter from charing cross to liverpool street says the world's work occupies by post three hours; by tube transit it would occupy twenty to forty minutes or by an express system of tube transit ten to fifteen minutes express messages carried by the post office in london last year numbered about a million and a half but the cost sometimes seems very heavy to send a special message by hand from hampstead to fleet street for example costs s d and takes about an hour it is claimed that it could be sent by pneumatic tube at a cost of d in from fifteen to twenty minutes and that for local service the tube would be far quicker than the telegraph and many times cheaper it has been calculated that from onesixth to onequarter of the wheeled traffic of london is occupied with the distribution of mails and parcels; and if the tubes relieved the streets to this extent this fact alone would be a strong argument in their favour it is impossible to believe that tube transmission on a gigantic scale will not come hitherto its development has been hindered by mechanical difficulties but these have been mostly removed in the united states where the adage time is money is lived up to in a manner scarcely known on this side of the atlantic the device has been welcomed for public libraries warehouses railway depôts factoriesin short for all purposes where the employment of human messengers means delay and uncertainty twenty years ago berlier proposed to connect london and paris by tubes of a diameter equal to that of the pipes contemplated in the scheme now before parliament our descendants may see the tubes laid; for when once a system of transportation has been proved efficient on a large scale its development soon assumes huge proportions and even the present generation may witness the tubes of our big cities lengthen their octopus arms till town and town are in direct communication after all it is merely a question of will it pay? we have the means of uniting edinburgh and london by tube as effectually as by telephone or telegraph and since the general trend of modern commerce is to bring the article to the customer rather than to give the customer the trouble of going to select the article in situthis applies of course to small portable things onlyshopping from a distance will come into greater favour and the pneumatic tube will be recognised as a valuable ally we can imagine that mrs robinson of say reading will be glad to be spared the fatigue of a journey to regent street when a short conversation over the telephone wires is sufficient to bring to her door within an hour a selection of silver ware from which to choose a wedding present and her husband whose car has perhaps broken a rod at newbury will be equally glad of the quick delivery of a duplicate part from the makers these are only two possible instances which do not claim to be typical or particularly striking if you sit down and consider what an immense amount of time and expense could be saved to you in the course of a year by a lightning despatch you will soon come to the conclusion that the pneumatic tube has a great future before it footnote  cassier's magazine xiii chapter xxiii an electric postal system  far swifter than the movements of air are those of the electric current which travels many thousands of miles in a second of time thirty miles an hour is the speed proposed for the pneumatic tube system mentioned in our last chapter an italian count roberto taeggi piscicelli has elaborated an electric post which if realised will make such a velocity as that seem very slow motion indeed cable railways for the transmission of minerals are in very common use all over the world at hongkong and elsewhere they do good service for the transport of human beings the car or truck is hauled along a stout steel cable supported at intervals on strong poles of wood or metal by an endless rope wound off and on to a steamdriven drum at one end of the line or motion is imparted to it by a motor which picks up current as it goes from the cable itself and other wires with which contact is made count piscicelli's electric post is an adaptation of the electric cableway to the needs of parcel and letter distribution at present the mail service between towns is entirely dependent on the railway for considerable distances and on motors and horsed vehicles in cases where only a comparatively few miles intervene london and birmingham to take an instance are served by seven despatches each way every twentyfour hours a letter sent from london in the morning would under the most favourable conditions not bring an answer the same dayat least not during business hours so that urgent correspondence must be conducted over either the telephone or the telegraph wires count piscicelli proposes a network of light cablewaysfour lines on a single set of supportsbetween the great towns of britain each lineor rather trackconsists of four wires two above and two below each pair on the same level the upper pair form the runway for the two main wheels of the carrier; the lower pair are for the trailing wheels three of the wires supply the threephase current which drives the carrier; the fourth operates the automatic switches installed every three or four miles for transforming the hightension volt current into lowtension volt current in the section just being entered the carriers would be suitable for letters bookparcels and light packages the speed at which they would move miles per hour to begin withwould render possible a tenminute service between say the towns already mentioned the inventor has hopes of increasing the speed to mph a velocity which would appear visionary had we not already before us the fact that an electric car weighing many tons has already been sent over the berlinzossen railway at miles per hour at any rate the electric post can reasonably be expected to outstrip the ordinary express train should such speeds as count piscicelli confidently discusses says the world's work be attained they would undoubtedly confer immense benefits upon the mercantile and agricultural communityupon the agricultural community because in this system is to be found that avenue of transmission to big centres of population of the products of la petite culture in which mr rider haggard for example in his invaluable book on rural england sees help for the farmer and for all connected with the cultivation of the soil count piscicelli proposes to obviate the delays at despatching and receiving towns by an interurban postal system in which the principal offices of any city would be connected with the headoffice and with the principal railway termini from each of the suboffices would radiate further lines along which postcollecting pillars are erected and over which lighter motors and collecting boxes similar to the despatch boxes travel the letter is put in through a slot and the stamp cancelled by an automatic apparatus with the name of the district number of the post and time of posting the letter then falls into a box at the foot of the column on the approach of a collectingbox the letter slot would be closed and by means of an electric motor the receptacle containing the letters lifted to the top of the column and its contents deposited in the collectingbox which travels alone past other postcollecting poles taking from each its toll and so on to the district office here in a mercantile centre a first sorting takes place local letters being retained for distribution by postmen and other boxes carry their respective loads to the different railway termini or central office were such an order of things established there would be a good excuse for the old country woman who sat watching the telegraph wire for the passage of a pair of boots she was sending to her son in far away lunnon! chapter xxiv agricultural machinery ploughsdrills and seedersreaping machinesthreshing machinespetroldriven field machineryelectrical farming machinery  agriculture is at once the oldest and most important of all national industries man being a graminivorous animalwitness his molar or grinding double teethhas since the earliest times been obliged to observe the seasons planting his crops when the ground is moist and reaping them when the weather is warm and dry apart from the nomad races of the deserts and steppes who find their chief subsistence in the products of the datepalm and of their flocks and herds all nations cultivate a large portion of the country which they inhabit ancient monuments the oldest inscriptions and writings bear witness to the prime importance of the plough and reapinghook; and it may be reasonably assumed that the progress of civilisation is proved by the increased use of cereal foods and better methods of garnering and preparing them for thousands of years the sickle which greek and roman artists placed in the hand of their goddess of the harvest and the rude plough consisting of perhaps only a crooked bough with a pointed end were practically the only implements known to the husbandman besides his spade and mattock where labour is abundant and each householder has time to cultivate the little plot which suffices for the maintenance of his own family and while there is little inducement to take part in other than agricultural industriestedious and timewasting methods have held their own but in highly civilised communities carrying on manufactures of all sorts it is difficult for the farmer to secure an abundance of human help and yet it is recognised that a speedy preparation and sowing of the land and a prompt gathering and threshing of the harvest is all in favour of producing a successful and wellconditioned crop in england eighty years ago three men lived in the country for every one who lived in the town now the proportion has been reversed; and that not in the british isles alone the world does not mean to starve; but civilisation demands that as few people as possible should be devoted to procuring the staff of life for both man and beast we should reasonably expect therefore that the immense advance made in mechanical science during the last century should have left a deep mark on agricultural appliances such an expectation is more than justified; for are there not many among us who have seen the sickle and the flail at work where now the selfbinder and threshing machine perform the same duties in a fraction of the time formerly required? the ploughman plodding sturdily down the furrow behind his clever team is indeed still a common sight; but in the tilling season do we not hear the snort of the steamengine as its steel rope tears a sixfurrow plough through the mellow earth? when the harvest comes we realise even more clearly how largely machinery has supplanted man; while in the processes of separating the grain from its straw the human element plays an even smaller part it would not be too much to say that were we to revert next year to the practices of our grandfathers we should starve in the year following this chapter will be confined to a consideration of machinery operated by horse steam or other power which falls under four main headingsploughs drills reapers and threshers  ploughs the firm of messrs john fowler and company of leeds is most intimately connected with the introduction of the steam plough and cultivator their first type of outfit included one engine only the traversing of the plough across the field being effected by means of cables passing round a pulley on a low fourwheeled truck moved along the opposite edge of the field by ropes dragging on an anchor another method was to have the engine stationary at one corner of the field and an anchor at each of the three other corners the two at the ends of the furrow being moved for every journey of the plough in or about the year this arrangement succumbed to the simple and as it now seems to us obvious improvement of introducing a second engine to progress visàvis with the first and do its share of the pulling the modern eightfurrow steam plough will turn ten acres a day quite easily at a much lower cost than that of horse labour for tearing up land after a crop cultivators are sometimes used they have arrowheadshaped coulters which cut very deep and bring large quantities of fresh earth to the surface the ground is now pulverised by harrows of various shapes according to the nature of the crop to be sown english farmers generally employ the spike harrow; but yankee agriculturists make great use of the springtooth form which may best be described as an arrangement of very strong springs much resembling in outline the springs of house bells the shorter arm is attached to the frame while the longer and pointed arm tears the earth  drills and seeders in highly civilised countries the man carrying a basket from which he flings seeds broadcast is a very rare sight indeed the primitive method may have been effectivea good sower could cover an acre evenly with half a pint of turnip seedbut very slow we now use a long bin mounted on wheels which revolves discs inside the bin furnished with tiny spoons round the periphery to scoop small quantities of seed into tubes terminating in a coulter the farmer is thus certain of having evenly planted and parallel rows of grain which in the early spring when the sprouting begins make so pleasant an addition to the landscape the corn or maize crop of the united states is so important that it demands special sowing machinery which plants single grains at intervals of about eighteen inches a somewhat similar device is used for planting potatoes passing over the weeding machines which offer no features of particular interest we come to the  reaping machines on which a vast amount of ingenuity has been expended at the beginning of the nineteenth century the royal agricultural society of great britain offered a prize for the introduction of a really useful machine which should replace the scythe and sickle several machines were brought out but they did not prove practical enough to attract much attention cyrus h mccormick invented in the reaper which with very many improvements added is today employed in all parts of the world the most noticeable point of this machine was the bar furnished with a row of triangular blades which passed very rapidly to and fro through slots in an equal number of sharp steel points against which they cut the grain the toandfro action of the cutterblade was produced by a connectingrod working on a crank rotated by the wheels carrying the machine illustration a wheatcutter a heading reaper being pushed over a wheat crop by six mules it cuts off the ears only leaving the straw standing the largest machines of this type used in california take swathes feet broad the first mccormick reaper did wonders on a virginian farm; other inventors were stimulated; and in there appeared the hussey reaper built on somewhat similar lines for twelve years or so these two machines competed against one another all over the united states; and then mccormick added a raker attachment which when sufficient grain had accumulated on the platform enabled a second man on the machine to sweep it off to be tied up into a sheaf at the great exhibition held in london in the judges awarded a special medal to the inventor reporting that the whole expense of the exhibition would have been well recouped if only the reaper were introduced into england from france mccormick received the decoration of the legion of honour for having done more for the cause of agriculture than any man then living it would be reasonable to expect that after this public recognition the mechanical reaper would have been immediately valued at its true worth yet no man had more difficulty in introducing his machines than that pioneer inventor of agricultural implements farmers everywhere were slow to accept it and manufacturers were unwilling to undertake its manufacture even after the value of the machine had been demonstrated everyone seemed to fear that it would break down on rocky and uneven fields; and the inventor had to demonstrate in person to the farmers the practicability of the reapers and then even guarantee them before the money could be obtained through all these trying discouragements the persistent inventor passed before he saw any reward for the work that he had spent half a lifetime in perfecting the ultimate triumph of the inventor may be sufficient reward for his labours and discouragements but those who would begrudge him the wealth that he subsequently made from his invention should consider some of the difficulties and obstacles he had to overcome in the beginning in an attachment was fitted to replace the second passenger on the machine four men followed behind to tie up the grain as it was shot off the machine inventors tried to abolish the need for these extra hands by means of a selfbinding device a practical method employing wire appeared in ; but so great was the trouble caused by stray pieces of the wire getting into threshing and other machinery through which the grain subsequently passed that farmers went back to hand work until the appleby patent of replaced wire by twine words alone would convey little idea of how the corn is collected and encircled with twine; how the knot is tied by an ingenious shuttle mechanism; and how it is thrown out into a set of arms which collect sufficient sheaves to form a stook before it lets them fall so we would advise our readers to take the next chance of examining a modern selfbinder and to persuade the man in charge to give as lucid an explanation as he can of the way in which things are done popular prejudice having once been conquered the success of the reapers was assured the year saw in use; by the output had increased to ; and today the manufacture of agricultural laboursaving machines gives employment to over people; an equal number being occupied in their transport and sale in all parts of the globe in california perhaps more than in any other country power agricultural machinery is seen at its best great tractionengines here take the place of human labour to an extraordinary extent the largest of hp and upwards with drivingwheels inches in diameter and flanges of generous width travel over the uneven surface of the grain fields crossing ditches and low places and ascending the sides of steep hills with as much apparent ease as a locomotive rolls along its steel rails such powerful tractionengines or 'automobiles' as they are commonly called by the american farmers are capable of dragging behind them sixteen inch ploughs four foot harrows and a drill and seeder the land is thus ploughed drilled and seeded all at one time from fifty to seventyfive acres of virgin soil can thus be ploughed and planted in a single day when the harvest comes the engines are again brought into service and the fields that would ordinarily defy the best efforts of an army of workmen are garnered quickly and easily the giant harvester is hitched to the tractionengine in place of the ploughs and harrows and cuts binds and stacks the golden wheat from seventyfive acres in a single day the cutters are feet wide and they make a clear swathe across the field some of them thresh clean and sack the wheat as fast as it is cut and bound other tractionengines follow to gather up the sacked wheat and whole trainloads of it thus move across the field to the granaries or railways of the seaboard or interior for dead ripe crops the header is often used in california instead of being pulled it is pushed by mules and merely cuts off the heads leaving the straw to be trampled down by the animals since it has no value swathes as wide as feet are thus treated the grain being threshed out while the machine moves one of the most beautiful and at the same time useful crops in the world is that of maize which feeds not only vast numbers of human beings but also countless flocks and herds the latter eating the green stalks as well as the ripened grain the united states alone produced no less than bushels of this cereal in as against bushels of wheat and bushels of barley now maize has a very tough stalk often feet high and an inch thick which cannot be cut with the ease of wheat or barley so a special machine has been devised to handle it the row of corn is picked up if fallen by chains furnished with projecting spikes working at an angle to the perpendicular so as to lift and simultaneously pull back the stalks which pass into a horizontal vshaped frame this has a broad opening in front but narrows towards its rear end where stationary sickles fixed on either side give the stalk a drawing cut before it reaches the single knife moving to right and left in the angle of the v which severs the stalk completely the mccormick machine gathers the corn in vertical bundles and ties them up ready for the shockers  threshing machines in principle these are simple enough the straw and grain is fed into a slot and pulled down between a toothed rotating drum and a fixed toothed concave these tear out the grain from the ear the former falls into the hopper of a winnowing and riddling machine which clears it from dust and husks and allows it to pass to a hopper an endless chain of buckets carries it to the delivery bins holding just one sackful each which when full discharge the grain through spouts into the receptacles waiting below their mouths an automatic counter records the number of sackfuls of corn that have been discharged so that dishonesty on the part of employés becomes practically an impossibility while the grain is thus treated oscillating rakes have arranged the straw and shaken it out behind in a form convenient for binding and the chaff has passed to its proper heap to be used as fuel for the engine or as food for cattle  petroldriven field machinery on water rail and road the petrol engine has entered into rivalry with steamvery successfully too and now it bids fair to challenge both steamengine and horse as the motive power for agricultural operations probably the bestknown english petroldriven farmer's help is that made by mr dan albone of biggleswade who in past times did much to introduce the safety bicycle to the public the ivel motor is not beautiful to look upon; its sides are slab its outlines rather suggestive of an inverted punt but it is a willing and powerful worker; requires no feeding in the early hours of the morning; no careful brush down after the day's work; no halts to ease wearied muscles in one tank is petrol in another lubricating oil in a third water to keep the cylinders cool a doublecylinder motor of hp transmits its energy through a large clutch and train of cogs to the road wheels made

motor does at least twice the work for the same money we may quote a paragraph from the pen of home counties a wellknown and perspicacious writer on agricultural topics it is because motorfarming is likely to result in a more thorough cultivation of the land and a more skilful and more enlightened practice of agriculture and not in a further extension of those deplorable landscratching and acregrasping methods of which so many pitiful examples may be seen on our clay soils that its beginnings are being sympathetically watched by many people who have the best interests of the rural districts and the prosperity of agriculture at heart will our farmers give the same welcome to the agricultural motor that was formerly accorded to the mechanical reaper? prophecy is risky but if before a decade has elapsed the horse has not been largely replaced by petrol on large farms and light land the writer of these lines will be much surprised  electrical farming machinery in france germany austria and the united states the electric motor has been turned to agricultural uses where waterpower is available it is peculiarly suitable for stationary work such as threshing chaffcutting rootslicing grinding etc the current can be easily distributed all over a large farm and harnessed to portable motors even ploughing has been done with electricity the energy being derived either from a steamengine placed near by or from an overhead supply passing to the plough through trolley arms similar to those used on electric trams the great advances made recently in electrical power transmission and in the efficiency of the electric motor bring the day in sight when on large properties the fields will be girt about by cables and poles as permanent fixtures all the usual agricultural operations of ploughing drilling and reaping will then be independent of horses or of steamengines panting laboriously on the headlands in fact the experiment has been tried with success in the united states whichever way we look giant steam is bowing before a superior power footnotes  cassier's magazine  the world's work vol iii chapter xxv dairy machinery milking machinescream separatorsa machine for drying milk  milking machines the farm labourer perched on a threelegged stool his head leaning against the soft flank of a cow as he squirts the milk in snowy jets into the frothing pail is like the blacksmith's forge throwing out its fiery sparkshower one of those sights which from childhood up exercise a mild fascination over the onlooker possibly he or she may be an interested person in more senses than one if the contents of the pail are ultimately to provide a refreshing drink for milk never looks so tempting as when it carries its natural froth modern methods of dairying demand the most scrupulous cleanliness in all processes pails pans and churns should be scoured until their shining surfaces suggest that on them the tiniest microbe could not find a footing buildings must be well aired scrubbed and treated occasionally with disinfectants even then danger may lurk unseen and the milk is therefore for certain purposes sterilised by heating it to a temperature approaching boilingpoint and simultaneously agitating it mechanically to prevent the formation of a scum on the surface it is then poured into sealed bottles which bid defiance to exterior noxious germs the human hand even if washed frequently is a difficult thing to keep scientifically clean the milkman has to put his hand now on the cow's side now on his stool; in short he is constantly touching surfaces which cannot be guaranteed germless he may therefore infect the teats which in turn infect the milk so that for health's sake as well as to minimise the labour and expense of milking various devices have been tried for mechanically extracting the fluid from the udder many of these have died quick deaths on account of their practical imperfections but one at least may be pronounced a successthe lawrencekennedy cowmilker which is worked by electricity and supplies another proof of the adaptability of the mysterious fluid to the service of man on the isle de la loge in the seine is a dairy farm which is most uptodate in its employment of laboursaving appliances including that just mentioned here a turbine generates power to work vacuum pumps of large capacity the pumps are connected to tubes terminating in coneshaped rubber caps that can be easily slipped on to the teat; four caps branching out from a single suction chamber as soon as they have been adjusted the milkmannow shorn of a great part of his rights to that titleturns on the vacuum cock and the pulsator a device to imitate the periodic action of hand milking commences to work the number of pulsations per minute can be regulated to a nicety by adjusting screws on its way to the pail the milk passes through a glass tube so that the operator may see when the milking is completed this method eliminates the danger of hand contamination it also protects the milk entirely from the air and it has been stated that when thus extracted milk keeps sweet for a much longer time than under the old system the cows apparently do not object to machinery replacing man not even the jersey breed which are the most fidgety of all the tribe under the heading of economy the user scores heavily for a single attendant can adjust and watch a number of mechanical milkers whereas one man one cow must be the rule where the hand is used from the point of romance the world may lose; the vacuum pump cannot vie with the pretty milkmaid of the songs practical people will however rest content with pure milk minus the beauty in preference to milk plus the microbe and the milkmaid whoespecially when she is a manis not always so very beautiful after all  cream separators in the matter of separating the fatty from the watery elements of milk machinery also plays a part the custom of allowing the cream to rise in open pans suffices for small dairies where speed and thoroughness of separation are not of primary importance but when cream is required in wholesale quantities for the markets of large towns or for conversion into butter much greater expedition is needed the mechanical cream separator takes advantage of the laws of centrifugal force milk is poured into a bowl rotating at high speed on a vertical axis the heavierwateryportions climb up the sides of the bowl in their endeavour to get as far away as possible from the centre of motion; while the lighter particles of cream not having so much momentum are compelled to remain at the bottom by a simple mechanical arrangement theveryskim milk is forced out of one tube and the cream out of another an efficient separator removes up to per cent of the butter fat small sizes worked by hand treat from to gallons of milk per hour; while the large machines extensively used in creameries and turned by horse steam electric or other power have a capacity of gallons per hour the saving effected by mechanical methods of separation is so great that dairyfarmers can now make a good profit on butter which formerly scarcely covered outofpocket expenses incurred in its manufacture  a machine for drying milk milk contains per cent of water and about per cent of nutritive matter milk which has had the water evaporated from it becomes a highly concentrated food very valuable for many purposes which could not be served by the natural fluid until lately the process of separating the solid and liquid constituents was too costly to render the manufacture of dried milk a profitable industry but now there is on the market a drying apparatus manufactured by messrs james milnes and son of edinburgh which almost instantaneously drives off the water the machine used for thisthe justhatmakerprocess is simple it consists of two large metal drums inches in diameter and feet long mounted horizontally in a framework with a space of about oneeighth of an inch between them highpressure steam admitted to the drums through axial pipes raises their surfaces to a temperature of ° fahr the milk is allowed to flow in thin streams over the revolving drums the heat of which quickly evaporates the water a coating of solid matter gradually forms and this is scraped off by a knife and falls into a receptacle the milk is not boiled nor chemically altered in any way though completely sterilised by the heat this machine promises to revolutionise the milk trade as farmers will now be able to convert the very perishable product of their dairies into an easily handled and imperishable powder of great use for cooking and the manufacture of sweetmeats explorers and soldiers can have their milk supply reduced to tabloid form and a pound tin of the lozenges will temper their tea or coffee over many a camp fire far removed from the domestic cow chapter xxvi sculpturing machines  the savage who with a flint point or bone splinter laboriously scratched rude figures on the walls of his cave dwelling did the best he was capable of to express the emotions which affect the splendidly equipped sculptor of today; he wished to record permanently some shape in which for the time he was interested religiously or otherwise the sun moon and stars figure largely in primitive religions as objects of worship they could be easily suggested by a few strokes of a tool but when mortals turned from celestial to terrestrial bodies and to the worship of human or animal formsthe graven images of the biblea much higher level of art was reached by the sculptor who endeavoured to give faithful representations in marble of the great men of the time and of the gods which his nation acknowledged the egyptians whose colossal monuments strew the banks of the nile worked in the most stubborn materialsbasalt porphyry and granitewhich would turn the edge of highly tempered steel and therefore raise wonder in our minds as to the nature of the tools which the subjects of the pharaohs must have possessed only one chisel of a bronze so soft that its edge turned at the first stroke against the rock under which it was found has so far come to light of steel tools there is no trace and we are left to the surmise that the ancients possessed some forgotten method of hardening other metalsincluding bronzeto a pitch quite unattainable today whatever were their implements they did magnificent work; witness the splendid sculptures of vast proportions to be found in the british museum; and the yet huger statues such as those of memnon and those at karnak which attract tourists yearly to egypt the egyptians admired magnitude; the greeks perfection of outline the human form in its most ideal development so often found among a nation with whom athleticism was almost a religion inspired many of the great classical sculptors whose work never has been and probably never will be surpassed great honour awaited the winner in the olympian games; but the most coveted prize of all was the permission given himthis after a succession of victories onlyto erect a statue of himself in the sacred grove near the shrine of olympian jove happy the man who knew that succeeding generations would gaze upon a marble representation of some characteristic attitude assumed by him during his struggle for the laurel crown until recently the methods of sculpture have remained practically unaltered for thousands of years the artist first models his idea in clay or wax on a small scale he then if he designs a lifesize or colossal statue erects a kind of iron skeleton to carry the clay of the fullsized model copied proportionately from the smaller one when this is finished a piecemould is formed from it by applying wet lumps of plaster of paris all over the surface in such a manner that they can be removed piecemeal and fitted together to form a complete mould into this liquid plaster is run for a hollow cast of the whole figure which is smoothed and given its finishing touches by the master hand this cast has next to be reproduced in marble both the cast and the block of marble are set up on scalestones revolving on vertical pivots an ingenious instrument called a pointing machine now comes into play it has two arms ending in fine metal points movable in ballandsocket joints these arms are first applied to the model the lower being adjusted to touch a mark on the scalestone the upper to just reach a mark on the figure the operator then clamps the arms and revolves the machine towards the block of marble the scalestone of which has been marked similarly to its fellow the bottom arm is now set to rest on the corresponding mark of the scalestone; but the upper which can slide back telescopically is prevented from assuming its relative position by the unremoved portions of the block the workman therefore merely notices the point on the block at which the needle is directed and drills a hole into the marble on the line of the needle's axis to a depth sufficient to allow the arm to be fully extended this process is repeated in some cases many thousands of times until the block has been honeycombed with small holes the carver can now strike off the superfluous marble never going beyond the depth of a hole; and a rough outline of the statue appears a more skilled workman follows him to shape the material to a close copy of the cast; and the sculptor himself adds the finishing touches which stamp his personality on the completed work only a select few of the world's greatest sculptors have ventured to strike their statues direct from the marble without recourse to a preliminary model such a one was michelangelo who as though seized by a creative frenzy would hew and hack a block so furiously that the chips flew off like a shower continuing his attack for hours yet never making the single false stroke that in the case of other masters has ruined the work of months he truly was a genius and must have possessed an almost supernatural faculty of knowing when he had reached the exact depth at any point in the great block of marble from which his design gradually emerged the formation of artistic models will always require the master's hand; but the reproduction of the cast in marble or stone can now be performed much more expeditiously than is possible with the pointing machine we have already two successful mechanisms which in an almost incredibly short time will eat a statue out of a block in faithful obedience to the movement of a pointer over the surface of a finished design they are the wenzel machine sculptor and signor augusto bontempi's meccaneglofo  the wenzel sculpturing machine in the basement of a large london business house we found one dark november afternoon two men at work with curiouslooking frameworks which they swayed backwards and forwards up and down to the accompaniment of a continuous clattering of metal upon stone approaching nearer we saw lying horizontally in the centre of the machine a small marble statue its feet clamped to a plate with deep notches in the circumference on either side at equal distances were two horizontal blocks of marble similarly attached to similar plates the workman had his eyes glued on a bluntnosed pointer projecting from the middle of a balanced frame this he passed slowly over the surface of the statue and simultaneously two whirring drills also attached to the frame ate into the stone blocks just so far as the movement of the frame would permit the drills were driven by electric power and made some thousands of revolutions per minute throwing off the stone they bit away in the form of an exceedingly fine white dust it was most fascinating to watch the almost sentient performance of the drills just as a pencil in an artist's hands weaves line into line until they all suddenly spring into life and show their meaning so did the drills chase apparently arbitrary grooves which united spread and finally revealed the roughhewn limb every now and then the machinist twisted the footplates round one notch and snicked the retaining bolts into them this exposed a fresh area of the statue and of the blocks to the pointer and the drills the large coarse drills used to clear away the superfluous material during the earlier stages of the work were replaced by finer points the low relief was scooped out the limbs moulded the delicate curves of cheek and the pencilling of eyebrows and lips traced and in a few hours the copies were ready for the usual smoothing and finishing at the hands of the human sculptor according to the capacity of the machine two four or six duplicates can be made at the cost of a little more power and time nor is it necessary to confine operations to stone and marble for we were shown some admirable examples of wooden statues copied from a delicate little bronze and were special drills provided the relations could be reversed bronze becoming passive to motions controlled by a wooden original sculpturing made easy would be a tempting legend to write over the wenzel machine but it would not represent the truth after all the mechanism only copies it cannot originate which is the function of the sculptor it stands to sculpturing in the same relation as the printer's process block to the artist's original sketch or the lithographic plates to the painter's coloured picture therefore prejudice against machinemade statues is as unreasonable as objection to the carefullyexecuted replica of a celebrated painting the sculptor himself has not produced it at first hand yet his personality has been stamped even on the copy for the machine can do nothing except what has already been done for it the machine merely displaces the old and imperfect pointing by hand substituting a method which is cheaper quicker and more accurate in its interpretation of the model it is obvious that apart from sculpture proper the industrial arts afford a wide field for this invention in architecture for instance carved wood and stonework for interiors and exteriors of buildings have been regarded hitherto as expensive luxuries yet in spite of their cost they are increasingly indulged in the architect now has at his disposal an economical method of carving which will enable him to utilise ornamental stonework to almost any degree sculptured friezes cornices and capitals which under the old régime would represent months of highly paid hand labour may now be reproduced rapidly and in any quantity by the machine which could be adapted to work on the scaffolding itself what will become of the stonemasons? won't they all be thrown out of work or at least a large number of them? the best answer to these questions will be found in a consideration of industries in which machinery has replaced hand work has england as a cottonspinning nation benefited because the powerloom was introduced? does she employ more operatives than she would otherwise have done and are these better paid than the old hand weavers? all these queries must have yes! written against them in like manner if statuary and decoration becomes inexpensive twenty people will be able to afford what hitherto was within the reach of but one; and an industry will arise beside which the output of the presentday monumental mason will appear very insignificant the sculpturing machine undoubtedly brings us one step nearer the universal house beautiful a complete list of the things which the versatile wenzel can perform would be tediously long let it therefore suffice to mention bootlasts gunstocks moulds engineering patterns numeral letters and other articles of irregular shape as some of the more prosaic productions which grow under the buzzing metal points some readers may be glad to hear that the wenzel promises another hobby for the individual who likes to use his hands since miniature machines are purchasable which treat subjects of a size not exceeding six inches in diameter no previous knowledge of carving is necessary and as soon as the elementary principles have been mastered the possessor of a small copier can take advantage of wet days to turn out statuettes busts and ornamental patterns for his own or friends' mantelpieces and surely a carefully finished copy in white marble of some dainty classic figure or group will be a gift well worth receiving! the amateur photographer the fretsawyer and the chipcarver will have to write ichabod over their workshops! the wenzel has left its experimental stage far behind the german emperor after watching the creation of a miniature bust of beethoven expressed his delight in a machine that could call a musician from lifeless stone the whole of the interior decoration of the magnificent rathaus charlottenburg offers a splendid example of mechanical wood carving which tourists would do well to inspect we may now pass to  the bontempi sculpturing machine for such is the translation of the formidable word meccaneglofo this machine is the invention of signor augusto bontempi a native of parma who commenced life as a soldier in the italian army and while still young has won distinction as a clever engineer his machine differs in most constructional details from the wenzel to begin with the pressure of the drills on the marble is imparted by water instead of by the hand; secondly the block to be cut is arranged vertically instead of horizontally; thirdly the indexpointer is not rigidly connected to the drill frame but merely controls the valves of hydraulic mechanism which guides the drills in any required direction the drills are rotated by electricity but all their other movements come from the pressure of water illustration a small wenzel automatic sculpturing machine this cuts statuettes two at a time out of stone or wood the cutters being guided by a pointer passed over the surface of the model by the girl undoubtedly the most ingenious feature of the bontempi apparatus is the pointer's hydraulic valve which gives the drills a forward lateral or upward movement or a compound of two or three movements when the pointer is not touched all the valve orifices remain closed and the machine ceases to work should the operator pull the pointer forwards a waterway is opened and the liquid passes under great pressure to a cylinder which pushes the drill frame forward if the pointer be also pressed sideways a second channel opens and brings a second cylinder into action and the frame as a whole is moved correspondingly while an upward twist operates yet a third set of cylinders and the workman himself rises with the drills as soon as the sensitive tip of the pointer touches an object it telescopes and immediately closes the valves so that the drills bore no further in that direction the original and copies are turned about from time to time on their bases in a manner similar to that already described in treating the wenzel as many as twenty copies can be made on the largest machines quite recently there has been installed in southwark london a gigantic bontempi which stands feet high and handles blocks feet inches square by feet high and some tons in weight owing to the huge masses to be worked only one copy can be made at a time; though doubtless if circumstances warranted the expense a machine could be built to do double triple or quadruple duty the proprietors have discovered an abrasive to grind graniteordinary steel chisels would be uselessand they expect a great demand for columns and monumental work in this stubborn material as their machines turn out finished stuff a dozen times faster than the mason an interesting story is told about the early days of signor bontempi's invention when he set up his experimental machine at florence the workmen following the example of the luddites rose in a body and threatened both him and his apparatus with destruction the police had to be called in to protect the inventor who thought it prudent to move his workshop to naples where the populace had broaderminded views the florentines are now sorry that they drove signor bontempi away for they find that instead of depressing the labour market the mechanical sculptor is a very good friend to both proprietor and employé notefor information and illustrations the author has to thank mr w hanson boorne of the machine sculpture company aldermary house london ec and mr e w gaz secretary of the automatic sculpture syndicate sumner street southwark chapter xxvii an automatic rifle  while science works ceaselessly to cure the ills that human flesh is heir to invention as persistently devises weapons for man's destruction yesterday it was the discoveries of pasteur and the maxim gun; today it is the finsen rays and the rexer automatic rifle though one cannot restrain a sigh on examining a new contrivance the sole function of which is to deal out death and desolationsadly wondering why such ingenuity might not have been directed to the perfecting of a machine which would render life more easy and more pleasant; yet from a book which deals with modern mechanisms we may not entirely exclude reference to a class of engines on which man has expended so much thought ever since gunpowder first entered the arena of human strife we therefore choose as our subject for this chapter a weapon hailing from denmark a country which though small in area contains many inventors of no mean repute in a london office within sight of the monument raised to england's great sailor hero the writer first made acquaintance with the rexer gun which venomous device that it is can spit forth death times a minute though it weighs only about lbs its form is that of an ordinary rifle of somewhat clumsy build the eye at once picks out a pair of supports which project from a ring encircling it near the muzzle even a strong man would find lbs too much to hold to his shoulder for any length of time; so the rexer is primarily intended for stationary work the user lies prone rests the muzzle on its supports presses the butt to his shoulder and blazes away history repeats itself in the chronicles of firearms though it is a very long way from the old matchlock supported on a forked stick to the latest thing in rifles propped up by two steel legs machineguns such as the maxim and hotchkiss weigh lbs and upwards and have to be carried on a wheeled carriage drawn either by horses or by a number of men in very rough country they must be loaded on packhorses or mules when required for action the gun its supports and appliances separated for packing must be hurriedly reassembled this means loss of valuable time the rexer rifle can be carried almost as easily as a leemetford or mauser and fires the ordinary smallbore ammunition wherever infantry or cavalry can go it can go too without entailing any appreciable amount of extra haulage before dealing with its actual use as a fighting arm we will notice the leading features of its construction the gun comprises the stock the casing and triggerplate which enclose the breech mechanism the barrel and the perforated barrel cover to which are attached the forked legs on which the muzzle end is supported when firing and which fold up under the cover when not in use the power for working the mechanism is obtained from the recoil which when the gun is fired drives the barrel together with the breech and the other moving parts some two inches backwards thus compressing the powerful recoilspring which lies behind the breech enclosed in the front part of the stock and which after the force of the recoil is spent expands and thus drives the barrel forward again into the firing position the recoil and return of the breech operate a set of levers and other working parts within the casing which by their combined actions following one another in fixed order open the breech eject the empty cartridgecase insert a new cartridge into the chamber and close the breech; and when the gun is set for automatic action and the gunner keeps his finger pressed on the trigger the percussion arm strikes the hammer and the cartridge is fired; the round of operations repeating itself till the magazine is emptied or until the gunner releases the trigger and thereby interrupts the firing a noticeable feature is the steel tube surrounding the barrel it is pierced with a number of openings to permit a circulation of air to cool the barrel which is furnished with fins similar to those on the cylinder of an aircooled petrol motor to help dissipate the heat caused by the frequent explosions near the ends of the cover are the guides in which the barrel moves backwards and forwards under the influence of the recoil and the recoilspring the supports are attached to the casing in such a way that the stock of the gun can be elevated or depressed and traversed through considerable angles without altering the position of the supports on the ground the rear end of the barrel cover is firmly fixed to the casing of the breech mechanism and forms with this and the stock the rigid part of the gun in which the moving portions work their motions being guided and controlled by cams and studs working in grooves and notches and on blocks attached to the rigid parts without the aid of special diagrams it is rather hard to explain the working of even a simple mechanism; but the writer hopes that the following verbal description for which he has to thank the rexer company will at least go some way towards elucidating the action of the breech components inside the casing is the breech the front end of which is attached rigidly to the barrel the rear end being in contact with the recoil arm which is directly operated by the recoil spring lying in a recess in the stock in the breech is the breechblock which has three functions first to guide the new cartridges from the distributer which passes them from the magazine one by one into the casing to the firing position in the chamber ie the expanded part of the bore at the rear end of the barrel; secondly to hold the cartridge firmly fixed in the chamber and to act as an abutment or support to the back of the cartridge when it is fired and thus transmit the backward force of the explosion to the recoil spring; thirdly to allow the spent cartridges to be discharged from the chamber by the extractor and to direct them by means of a guide curved downwards from the chamber so that they may be flung through an opening provided for that purpose in the triggerplate in front of the trigger and out of the way of the gunner this opening is closed by a cover when the gun is not in use and opens automatically before the shot can be fired in order to effect this threefold object the breechblock is pivoted in the rear to the rear of the breech and has a vertical angular motion within it so that the fore end of the block can move into three different positions in relation to the chamber one below the chamber to guide the cartridge into it; one directly in line with the chamber to back the cartridge; and one above the chamber to allow the ejection of the spent cartridgecase by the extractor the cartridge is fired by a long pin through the breechblock struck behind by a hammer operated by a special spring the first function of the breechblock is as we have said to act as a guide for the cartridge into the chamber ready for firing after the fashion of the old martinihenry breechblock the actual pushing forward of the cartridge is performed by a lever sliding on the top of the block after the explosion a small vertical lever jerks out the cartridgecase against the block and causes it to cannon downwards through the aperture in the triggerplate already mentioned on the lefthand side of the breech casing is a small chamber open at the top and on the side next the breech to the top is clipped the magazine filled with twentyfive cartridges the magazine is shaped somewhat like a slice of melon only that the curved back and front are parallel the sides converge towards the inner edge it is closed at the lower end by a spring secured by a catch when a magazine is attached to the open top of the chamber the catch is released so as to put chamber and magazine in direct communication the cartridges would then be able to drop straight into the breech chamber through the side slot were the latter not protected by a curved horizontal shutter called the distributer its action is such that when a cartridge is being passed through into the breech casing the shutter closes and holds the remaining cartridges in the magazine; and when the cartridge has passed it opens and lets the next into position in the side casing as soon as a cartridge enters the breech it is pushed forward into the chamber ready for firing by the feeder lever the magazine and the holder are so arranged that when the last cartridge has passed from the magazine to the distributer the motion of the moving parts of the gun is arrested till the magazine is removed when the motion is resumed so far as to push the remaining cartridge into the chamber and bring the breechblock into the firing position when another magazine has been fixed in the holder firing can be resumed by pulling the trigger; but if another magazine is not fixed in the holder the last cartridge cannot be fired by pulling the trigger and only by pulling a handle which will be presently described this arrangement secures the continuance of the automatic firing being interrupted only by the very brief interval required for charging the apparatus the gun is fired as usual by pulling a trigger if a steady pull be kept on the trigger the whole contents of the magazine will be fired automatically the last cartridge excepted; but if such continuous firing is not desired a few shots at a time may be fired automatically by alternately pulling and releasing the trigger if it is desired to fire shot by shot from the magazine a small swivel on the triggerguard is moved so as to limit the movement of the trigger by moving this swivel out of the way automatic firing is resumed the gun may also be fired without a magazine by simply feeding cartridges by hand into the magazine holder in front of the triggerguard is a safety catch and if this is set to safe the gun cannot be fired until the catch is moved to fire it is obvious that the recoil cannot come into action until a shot has been fired a handle is therefore provided on the righthand side outside the casing by means of which the bolt forming the axis of the recoil and percussion arms may be turned so as to imitate the action of the recoil this handle must be turned to bring the first cartridge into the chamber but this having been done the handle returns to its normal position and need not be moved again we may now watch a gunner at work he chooses his position opens out the supports and pushes them into the ground so as to give the muzzle end a firm bearing he then takes a magazine from the box he carries with him and fixes it by a rapid motion into the magazine holder then resting his left hand on the stock to steady it he pulls over the handle with his right so as to bring the barrel and all the moving mechanism into the backward position he then releases the handle and the recoil spring comes into action and drives the breech forward when the controlling gear brings the front end of the breechblock into its downward position admits the first cartridge into the breech and pushes it forward by the cartridgefeeder into the barrel chamber the breechblock then rises to its central position at the back of the cartridge and the gun is ready for firing if automatic firing is required the gunner sets the swivel at the back of the trigger in the right position sights the object at which he has to fire and pulls the trigger thereby exploding the first cartridge the recoil then drives back the barrel and the breech the breechblock is moved into its highest position making room for the ejection of the empty cartridgecase which is then ejected by the extractor at the end of the recoil the block falls into its lowest position the cartridgefeeder having then arrived at the back of the breechblock the recoilspring now drives the breech forward admits the new cartridge on to the breechblock and drives it forward by the feeder into the chamber the breechblock rises to its position behind the cartridge and is locked in that position the percussion arm is then released automatically strikes the hammer and fires the second cartridge the cycle of operations repeating itself till the last cartridge but one has been fired when the magazine is charged and the cycle of operations is again renewed and continued till the second set of cartridges has been fired the operations follow one another with such rapidity that the twentyfive cartridges contained in the magazine can be fired in less than two seconds at the same time the rate of firing remains under the control of the gunner who can interrupt it at any moment by simply releasing the trigger he can also alter his aim at any time and keep it directed on a moving object and fire at any suitable moment illustration the rexer automatic machine gun it only weighs lb and can fire shots per minute the crescentshaped clips hold cartridges each and as soon as one has been emptied another can be affixed in a moment in service it is not intended that every man should be armed with a rexer but only to per cent constituting a separate detachment which would act independently of the artillery and other machineguns the latter would as at present cover the infantry's advance up to within some yards of the enemy but at this point would have to cease firing for fear of hitting their own men this period when the artillery can neither shoot over the heads of their infantry nor bring up the guns for fear of losing the teams affords the golden opportunity for the rexer which is advanced with the firing line if the fire of the detachment were concentrated on a part of the enemy's line that portion would be unable to reply while the attacking force rushed up to close quarters one hundred men armed with rexers would be as valuable as several hundred carrying the ordinary service weapon while they would be much more easily disposed advanced or withdrawn a squadron of cavalry would be accompanied by three troopers armed with rexers and by one leading a packhorse laden with extra magazines each gunner would have on his horse cartridges and the packhorse rounds distributed in leather cases over a specially designed saddle when a squadron not provided with machineguns has to open a heavy fire a considerable proportion must remain behind the firing line to hold the horses of the firing party when on the other hand rexers are present only a few men would dismount leaving the main body ready to charge at the opportune moment; and should the attack fail they could cover the retreat a use will also be found for the rexer in fortresses and on war vessels; in fact everywhere where the machinegun can take a part after exhaustive trials the danish government has adopted this weapon for both army and navy; and it doubtless will presently be included in the armament of other governments there are signs that the most deadly arm of the future will be the automatic rifle perhaps a pattern even lighter than the rexer may appear if every unit of a large force could fire rounds a minute and ammunition were plentiful we could hardly imagine an assault in which the attacking party would not be wiped out even if similarly armed; for with the perfection of firearms the man behind cover gets an everincreasing advantage over his adversary advancing across the open  a ballbearing rifle rapidity of fire is only one of the desirable features in a firearm its rangeor perhaps we had better say its muzzle velocityis of almost equal importance the greater this is the flatter is the trajectory or curve described by the bullet and the more extended the point blank range and the danger zone take the case of two rifles capable of flinging a bullet one mile and two miles respectively riflemen seldom fire at objects further off than say yards; so that you might think that given correct sighting in the weapon and a positive knowledge of the range both rifles would have equal chances of making a hit this is not the fact however for the more powerful rifle sends its bullet on a course much more nearly parallel to the ground than does the other therefore an object six feet high would evidently run greater risks of being hit somewhere by the twomile rifle than by the onemile thus if at yards the bullet had fallen to within six feet of the ground it might not actually strike earth till it had travelled yards; whereas with a lesser velocity and higher curve the point of impact might be only fifty yards behind evidently a sixfoot man would be in danger anywhere in a belt yards broad were the highvelocity rifle in operation though the danger zone with the other weapon would be contracted to fifty yards at close quarters a flat trajectory is even more valuable since it diminishes the need for altering the sights if a rifle's pointblank range is up to yards you can fire at a man's head anywhere within that distance with a good chance of hitting him the farther he is away the lower he will be hit a high trajectory would necessitate an alteration of the sights for every fifty yards beyond say two hundred the velocity of a projectile is increased by increasing the weight of the driving charge; by decreasing the friction between the barrel and the projectile an american inventor mr orlan c cullen has adopted a means already well tried in mechanical engineering to decrease friction he has produced a rifle the barrel of which has in its walls eight spiral grooves of almost circular section a small arc of the circle being cut away so as to put the groove in continuous communication with the bore of the barrel these grooves are filled with steel balls onetenth of an inch in diameter which are a good fit and on the slot side of the groove project a very tiny distance into the barrel the bulletof hard steelas it is driven through the barrel does not come into contact with the walls but runs over the balls which grip it with sufficient force to give it a spinning motion the inventor claims that there is no appreciable escape of gas round the bullet as the space between it and the barrel is so minute the ball races or grooves extend back to the powder chamber and forward to the muzzle their twist ceases a short distance from the muzzle to permit the insertion of recoil cushions which break the forces of the balls as they are dragged forward by the bullet mr cullen holds that a rifle built on this principle gives per cent greater velocity than one with fixed riflingto be exact has a pointblank range of yards as compared with yards of the leemetford and will penetrate planks inch thick each the absence of friction brings absence of heat which in the case of machineguns has always proved a difficulty it also minimises the recoil and reduces the weight of mountings for large guns whether these advantages sufficiently outweigh the disadvantages of complication and cleaning difficulties to render the weapon acceptable to military authorities remains to be seen we can only say that if the ball bearing proves as valuable in ballistics as it has in machinery then its adoption for firearms can be only a matter of time
