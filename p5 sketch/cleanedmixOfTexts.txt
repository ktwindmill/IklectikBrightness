migration guide learn the changes between version of the oracle java me embedded and the current instance version  if you need to port earlier applications to the latest version of the oracle java me embedded runtime you can safely skip this chapter if you have not developed imlets using version or earlier of the oracle java me embedded platform topics • overview • modified permission model • device io namespace • generic connection framework changes overview java me is an umbrella terms for two new jsrs cldc and meep cldc is a major evolution of cldc while meep is a major evolution of impng java me also includes support for the new device io api cldc is backwards compatible with cldc but includes alignment with the java se and language core apis and vm functionality java sestyle classbased finegrain permissions as well as a significantly enhanced generic connection framework gcf meep allows execution of most impng applications and includes significant enhancements by leveraging the cldc features improvements in the application platform improved software provisioning and management footprint scalability through optional apis improved connectivity options and more flexible authentication and authorization mechanisms the device io api defines an api that allows java applications running on small embedded devices to access peripheral devices from a peripheral device external to the host device to a peripheral chip embedded in the host device it is strongly recommended that developers familiarize themselves with the cldc specification and api the meep specification and api and the device io api modified permission model there are a number of new permissions that object methods must obtain before they can successfully access peripherals these permissions are covered in more detail in chapter however developers should be aware of the following • java me now uses java sestyle classbased finegrain permissions developer migration guide • applications should request the jdkdiodevicemgmtpermission permission when accessing any devices connected to the board through protocols such as gpio ic spi or mmio in addition to the permissions required by the communication bus they are using • the syntax for the permissions request has changed the request now includes the device identifier and any specific actions that are requested if applicable device identifiers eg gpio spi are listed in the appropriate appendix of the getting started guide for that development board • a single request cannot be used for multiple devices; each permissions must be listed separately for example you cannot do the following midletpermission jdkdiogpiopinpermission gpiogpio open instead you must do this midletpermission jdkdiogpiopinpermission gpio open midletpermission jdkdiogpiopinpermission gpio open in some cases you can use an asterisk as a wildcard device io namespace the device access api of the oracle java me embedded platform is now referred to as the device io api and is no longer part of the comoracledeviceaccess package instead all classes now use the jdkdio namespace in addition • classes that contain peripheral have been changed to device so for example peripheralmanager has been replaced by devicemanager and peripheralpermission has been replaced by devicepermission • support now exists for pulse width modulation pwm on all platforms • almost all of the individual class methods are unchanged generic connection framework changes the impng javaxmicroedition classes are now replaced by the generic connection framework gcf with jsr and java me embedded profile classes meep with jsr there are a large number of changes that are included in these new profiles see the specification pages online for more information on each of these classes device io namespace developer’s guide java embedded vm proxy and console starting from version the oracle java me embedded software moves as much cpu intensive processing away from the embedded java vm as possible instead a separate application running on the host side interacts across the network with the internals of the java vm with this design the vm only sends lowlevel events to the host application such as state change information methods transition and objects information the information is then stored and analyzed on host side and the host application in turn provides the information to all external profilers monitors and managers external tools can treat the java se host application as if it was the vm itself besides performance and footprint goals this approach minimizes development efforts on porting different component communications to new physical transport such as usb serial or bluetooth instead this vm proxy application also known as the developer agent and the vm proxy channel becomes the intercomponent tool and javacall cldc meep jsrs and sdk components can all take advantage of it topics • design • starting the vm proxy on the desktop • vm proxy options • using the command line interface design the vm proxy uses a single transport connection to transmit all data for any subsystem see figure for an illustration of this design; the vm proxy is the middle component java embedded vm proxy and console figure vm proxy and agent design for java embedded be sure not to confuse the vm proxy with the vm agent the vm agent consists of native code and is located on the embedded device the vm proxy is written in java se and is launched on the desktop host the proxy also provides a software management swm api similar to the javaxmicroeditionswm package as declared in the java me embedded profile meep specification this api is an extension of the previous application management system ams api of previous versions of the oracle java me embedded platform and can be leveraged by me sdk ides and the cli to manage applications with any connected device the transport layer between the vm proxy desktop and the vm agent device is protocolagnostic by design however it is currently implemented for tcp serial com port and usb the transport can initiate connection establishment in any direction either from device to host or vise versa starting the vm proxy on the desktop to use the vm proxy extract the files from your copy of the oracle java me embedded zip archive on the windows desktop the vm proxy program is found as a jar file inside the util directory of the oracle java me embedded distribution named proxyjar you can start the vm proxy on the desktop host computer either in a server or a client mode as described below server mode connection the server mode is used by default in this mode the vm proxy must be started after the java runtime is started on the embedded board then do the following change to the util directory on your desktop host and enter the following command you should see an output similar to the following c\mydir\util java jar proxyjar socket raspberry pi ip address channel closed available trying to open socket connection with device ip address connected to the socket socketaddr=ip address port localport= debugger connection initialized client mode connection to switch to a client mode connection perform the following steps starting the vm proxy on the desktop developer’s guide edit the jwcpropertiesini file on the embedded board as follows • set the proxyconnectionmode property to the client value • set the proxyclientconnectionaddress property to the ip address of the host running the developer agent start the java runtime on the embedded board change to the lib directory on your desktop host and enter the following command you should see an output similar to the following c\mydir\util java jar proxyjar starting with default parameters serversocketport jdbport channel closed available waiting for device connections on port by default the proxy listens for cli connections at port on the host the port can be changed by passing the cliport option while launching the proxy vm proxy options the following options are available when starting the vm proxy using the java jar proxyjar command no options runs proxy with default transport the host opens a server socket and waits for a connection from the embedded device this means the java embedded runtime should be started on the device with its jwcpropertiesini file containing the following settings proxyconnectionmode=client proxyclientconncetionaddress=ip address of vm proxy socket ipaddress runs the proxy as a client this means that the device should open a server socket and wait for a connection from the host the java embedded runtime should be started on the device with its jwcpropertiesini file containing the following setting proxyconnectionmode=server serial comport – runs the proxy with a serial transport this means that the vm proxy communicates with device across the specified serial port debug – adds additional debugging information when the vm proxy is running i – runs cli in the command shell proxy in interactive mode cliacceptanyhost – accepts connections to cli from any host by default only localhost connections are accepted proxyhost host address– specifies the http proxy address for outbound ip connections from the proxy proxyport proxy port – specifies the http proxy port for outbound ip connections from the proxy use the help proxy option to preview the list of the available options vm proxy options java embedded vm proxy and console using the command line interface once the vm proxy is running on the desktop you can use the ams cli the easiest way to do this is to start a putty executable on your desktop computer and connect to localhost at port this is shown in figure see the appropriate getting started guide for your embedded board for platformspecific information on using the command line interface figure putty configuration the window from port provides a commandline interface cli and is shown in figure using the command line interface developer’s guide figure commandline interface warning the commandline interface cli feature in this oracle java me embedded

see the device io api specification and the associated javadocs at the following site httpdocsoraclecomjavame signing the application with api permissions first the jad file must have the proper api permissions here is how to sign the application both in netbeans and without an ide • in netbeans rightclick the project name and choose properties select application descriptor then in the resulting pane select api permissions click the add button and add the appropriate permissions as shown in figure click ok to close the project properties dialog figure adding permissions using the netbeans ide • if you are not using an ide you can manually modify the application descriptor file to contain the following permissions midletpermission comoraclediodevicemgmtpermission open method # signing application using the netbeans ide the netbeans ide enables developers both to sign the applications with a local certificate and upload the certificate on the device see the appropriate getting started guide for your embedded platform to learn how to use the netbeans ide to sign your application accessing peripherals developer’s guide method # signing application using a command line signing applications using a command line is the preferred route for applications that are widely distributed here are the instructions on how to setup a keystore with a local certificate that can be used to sign the applications generate a new selfsigned certificate with the following command on the desktop using the keytool that is shipped with the oracle java se jdk keytool genkey v alias mycert keystore mykeystoreks storepass spass keypass kpass validity keyalg rsa keysize dname cn=thehost this command generates a bit rsa key pair and a selfsigned certificate placing them in a new keystore with a keystore password of spass and a key password of kpass that is valid for days you can change both passwords as desired copy the certs directory from the board over to the desktop using an sftp client or scp command change into the certs directory and perform the following command using the mekeytoolexe command or alternatively java jar mekeytooljar if your distribution contains only that that ships with the oracle java me sdk distribution mekeytool import mekeystore mainks keystore mykeystoreks storepass spass alias mycert domain trusted this command imports the information in mykeystoreks that you just created to the mainks keystore after this is completed copy the certs directory back to the board by using an sftp client or scp command use the following commands to sign your application before deploying it to the board jadtool addcert chainnum alias myalias keystore mykeystoreks storepass spass inputkad myjadjad outputjad myjadjad to sign with the sha signature

permission is equivalent to exitvm setsecuritymanager setting of the security manager possibly replacing an existing security manager the security manager is a class that allows applications to implement a security policy granting the setsecuritymanager permission would allow code to change which security manager is used by installing a different possibly less restrictive security manager thereby bypassing checks that would have been enforced by the original security manager createsecuritymana ger creation of a new security manager this gives code access to protected sensitive methods that may disclose information about other classes or the execution stack setio setting of systemout and systemerr this allows changing the value of the standard system streams an attacker may set

software management this chapter introduces the software management swm apis of the java me embedded profile meep version these apis provided extended software management features for oracle java me embedded applications as given in the javaxmicroeditionswm package there are five interfaces and six classes in this package that can be used by applications to enhance software management in addition there are a number of enumerations that are present in the package; these are documented near the classes and methods that use them throughout this chapter suiteinstalllistener interface suiteinstalllistener is a subinterface that provides progress data for an installer that is downloading an app or a link the interface consists of two methods both of which are called at certain times during installation one is the installationdone method which provides only a single code the definitions of which can be found in the installererrorcode interface the other is the updatestatus method which identifies the current task as one of the suiteinstallstage constants that are shown in table and provides an integer percentage of completeness table suiteinstallstate name description done installation has completed downloadingbody install stage downloading application body downloadingdata install stage downloading additional application data downloadingdescriptor install stage downloading application descriptor storing install stage storing application verifying install stage verifying downloaded content here are the two method defined in the suiteinstalllistener interface • void installationdoneint errorcode this method is called by the installer to report that the installation has completed the resulting integer code is contained in the installererrorcode class see “installererrorcode” for more information about installation error codes • void updatestatussuitemanagementtracker tracker suiteinstallstage status int percent software management this method is called by the installer to inform the listener of the current status of the install the stage is given by an integer constant as shown in table the percent is an integer between and suitelistener interface suitelistener is an interface that provides a notification that the current state of a suite has changed there is only one method defined in the suitelistener interface • void

implementation of a suitemanager • static taskmanager gettaskmanager this method returns an implementation of a taskmanager the suite class all imlet suites maintain a basic set of identification and state information that acts as a descriptor this descriptor is represented by the suite class suites can be one of four types presented in the suitetype enumeration and shown in table table suitetype enumeration suite type description stapplication the suite contains one or more midlets with an entry point that can be executed stlibrary the suite is a library that can be used by one or more applications stsystem the suite is a systemlevel application stinvalid the suite is invalid and cannot be found or executed in addition suites contain binary flags that describe their state presented

this suite installer • void removeinstallationlistenersuiteinstallationlistener listener this method removes a suiteinstalllistener to this suite installer • suitemanagementtracker start this method starts installation of the suite the installation can be the first installation of this suite or a reinstallation update of a suite that had been installed before a suiteinstalllistener must be added in order to handle callback requeststhis method returns an instance of suitemanagementtracker; the caller can observe the progress of the installation via the suiteinstalllistener added please note that the method may not return quickly depending on the provisioning mechanism used in the implementation of meep it may be necessary to download the entire jar data first in order to inspect the manifest of the application suite in order to find out whether this is a new installation or an update of an existing application suite depending on the network connection this may take some timein case the previous attempt to install this suite initiated by a previous call of the start method has not been finished at the time the new call takes place the call is queued and the new attempt to install in case the first one failed or the reinstallation in case the first call was successful respectively starts as soon as the first installation attempt or installation has been finisheda new instance of suitemanagementtracker will be created for every call to this method and assigned to the suite to be installed as soon as the installation has been completed successfully in case of an update of an existing suite the suitemanagementtracker instance is assigned to the existing suite object from the beginningif the initiating application does not have the right swmpermission the installation will fail with installerrorcodesunauthorizedinstall • void cancel begins installation of the suite suitemanagementtracker class an instance of this class is generated as soon as an installation or update of a suite is started using suiteinstallerstart invoking that method creates a new tracker instance whether two trackers refer to the same suite can be found out by calling getsuite for both and compare the returned suite instances the tracker instance created for a management operation is passed to any call of suitelistenernotifysuitestatechanged in order to inform about the progress of this operation for the installation of a new suite as long as the installation hasn't been successfully completed an instance of suitemanagementtracker is not assigned to any suite instance yet as it does not exit yet in these cases a call to getsuite returns null suiteinstaller class developer’s guide in case of an update the tracker is assigned to the existing suite from the beginning though this class has one method • suite getsuite this method returns the suite that this tracker is assigned to if the installation has completed successfully swmpermission class the swmpermission provides permission handling for swm api permissions an swmpermission object contains a scope and actions the scope is the scope of the permission valid scopes are client stands for permission to perform the listed actions only for applications assigned to the same client crossclient stands for permission to perform the listed actions also for applications assigned to other clients usually this is a permission reserved for the root client granting this permissions to other clients should be figured out well in order to avoid security breachesthe actions to be granted are passed to the constructor in a nonempty string containing a list of commaseparated keywords trailing and leading white spaces as well as those between the keywords and commas in the list are not allowed and lead to an illegalargumentexception the possible values can be seen in this table in the security policy provider chapter of the spec the actions string is converted to lowercase before processing this class has one constructor and several methods • swmpermissionjavalangstring scope javalangstring actions this method creates a new swmpermission object with the specified name and actions • public boolean impliesjavasecuritypermission p this method checks if the specified permission is implied by this object • string getactions this method returns the permitted actions of this

effect a simple task descriptor a task is the abstraction of the execution of an application see javaxmicroeditionmidletmidlet tasks are started using the taskmanagerstarttask method where the arguments specify the application suite and the class within the suite being the starting point of the application starting a new task attempts to execute corresponding application a task has a status as described in the taskstatus enumeration that describes corresponding application lifecycle state a task has a priority with possible values as described in taskpriority depending on whether the implementation supports multiple vms several tasks can run in parallelthere are special tasks called system tasks those tasks cannot be started or stopped via this api but are started by the swmpermission class software management system the issystemtask method can be used to find out whether a task is a considered a system task the task class contains the following methods • string getname this is a convenience method for returning the name of the task the returned string is the name of the application running in this task • taskpriority getpriority this method returns the priority of given task • public int getheapuse this method returns the heap use of given task • public taskstatus getstatus this method returns the task's status • public suite getsuite this method

general purpose inputoutput gpio functionality in the oracle java me embedded product gpio typically refers a generic pin on an embedded board whose behavior including whether it is an input or output pin can be programmed by the user at runtime gpio pins are often lined up in rows by design they have no dedicated purpose and are used by programmers for a wide variety of tasks for example • gpio pins can be enabled or disabled • gpio pins can be configured to be input or output • input values are readable often with a representing a high voltage and a representing a low voltage • input gpio pins can be used as interrupt lines which allow a peripheral board connected via multiple pins to signal to the primary embedded board that it requires attention • output pin values are both readable and writable warning be sure to observe manufacturer's specifications and warnings carefully for example with the raspberry pi board the voltage value that represents a high value on an input pin may be volts +v however other pins may output volts +v be sure to check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure that you are not placing too much voltage on an input gpio line as the board may not have an overvoltage protection gpio pins have much greater functionality than this but it is important to start with the basics setting a gpio output pin for this example you will need the following hardware table hardware for gpio example hardware where to obtain raspberry pi mb rev b b+ or raspberry pi various thirdparty sellers multimeter various sinometer dtb used in the example general purpose inputoutput perhaps the simplest example of working with the gpio functionality in the oracle java me embedded product is to set the highlow value of an arbitrary output pin and read its voltage with a multimeter in this example we set the value of gpio pin to alternate between high v and low v at intervals of seconds and seconds respectively the following example shows the source

permissions must be added to the application descriptor of the imlet so that it will execute without any security exceptions from the oracle java me embedded runtime table permissions for gpio example permission device operation jdkdiodevicemgmtpermission gpio open note that if you're using an ide such as netbeans as the development environment you will need to access the project properties of the project and set api permissions under the application descriptor as shown in figure figure api permissions in the application descriptor in netbeans after running the application set your multimeter to read dc voltage with a maximum of v then connect one of the leads of the multimeter to gpio and the other to gnd ground as the application is running note that the voltage that is read by the multimeter will jump from its low value of around v after a call to pinsetvaluefalse to its high value of around v after a call to pinsetvaluetrue this is shown in figure and figure warning remember that the gpio pin assignments on the raspberry pi do not match the pin numbers on the board for example gpio is not mapped to pin but instead pin see appendix a or the hardwareappropriate getting started guide for the pin assignments for the target boards of the oracle java me embedded software setting a gpio output pin general purpose inputoutput figure raspberry pi pin with low v voltage figure raspberry pi pin with high v voltage working with a breadboard when prototyping circuits it is often helpful to have a way of connecting wires without having to perform soldering in some cases if there are only a few connections you can use jumper wires however when layout out more complex circuits it's helpful to use a breadboard a typical breadboard is shown in figure working with a breadboard developer’s guide figure a typical breadboard a breadboard consists of a large number of holes each of which are wired together on the bottom using a standardized pattern such as the one shown in figure note that the two columns on both the left and the right of the breadboard are wired verticallythese provide power + and ground connections that can be tapped into to the horizontal rows on either side of the center line on the other hand are used to create circuits circuits can be created using small wires with metal tips on each end that can plug into the holes working with a breadboard general purpose inputoutput figure wiring pattern for a typical breadboard for the raspberry pi we can connect the gpio pins on the pi to a breadboard using a device called a tcobbler extension board this device attaches a ribbon cable to the gpio pins which in turn connects to the tcobbler board the tcobbler board is then inserted into the top of the breadboard as shown in figure working with a breadboard developer’s guide figure tcobbler extension board for the raspberry pi once connected to the pi you can use any of the holes running along the red stripe on the left side of the breadboard to provide + volts v or any of the holes running along the red stripe on the right side of the breadboard to provide + volts v in addition any of the holes running along the blue stripes on either side of the board connect to the ground gnd on the raspberry pi the gpio pins on the raspberry pi map to the pins on the tcobbler and hence the respective horizontal rows on the breadboard as shown in figure working with a breadboard general purpose inputoutput table broadcom gpio to tcobbler conversion gpio pi pin number alternate name pin sda pin scl pin p pin ce pin ce pin

setblinkrate writedisplay and clear let's cover each of these in more detail the begin method will initialize the display there are three operations that must be performed to do this properly first the oscillator on the htk led backboard must be turned on we can do this by sending a byte value of hex x across the bus next we set the blink rate of the segment display to one of four values off hz hz or hz finally we can set the brightness of the display using a value of to for the latter two operations we make use of the next two methods which can also be called independently the setblinkrate and setbrightness methods simply take an input value perform bounds checking and calculate the correct byte value to send across the bus just like turning on the oscillator we only need to send one byte across the bus to modify the blink rate or brightness to any level we choose the writedisplay method on the other hand is a little more complex here the class makes use of an array of integers declared as a field that serves as a display experimenting with a segment display developer’s guide buffer in reality the writedisplay method will truncate any value larger then before sending it across the bus but making it an array of integers is helpful for the user each of the entries in the array will map to an address on the htk led backpack that can be written to using the ic bus the purpose of each of the addresses is shown in table note that since the htk can drive different types of led displays several of the addresses are ignored when using this particular character segment

the untrusted security domain by default we can access the keystore similar to accessing it with the java se environment first we create a keystoreentry object and populate it with a certificate this is in turn added to the embedded keystore via a simple loop and iterated over later in the program here is the output after running the program creating x certificate with serial number add keystore

b@ae configuring the board as a secure server the java me embedded binary contains functionality that enables an embedded board to function as a server using secure protocols the functionality is identical to the configuration of a java se server the secure server connection requires a server certificate on the device this certificate should be imported into the device with a private key

encryption this example uses a secureserverconnection object which creates a socket at port using the ssl protocol it is essential to include the following line as well sscacceptandopen; without this line the secure socket will never accept an incoming connection and any attempt to make a connection will result in a runtime exception note that a call to this method will block until a successful connection is made as with the previous examples the java me embedded keystore must have a valid server certificate for the trustlevel that the application is running under which will be validated upon any secure connection if the certificate is absent or is not valid an exception will be thrown on the server the clientside code to make the connection is nearly identical to the clientside example earlier in this chapter with a slight change to the port and the protocol a successful connection should output the following address port connection made! configuring the board as a secure server developer’s guide a java me optimization techniques this appendix covers common optimization techniques when working with java me embedded devices many of these techniques are common to the cldc vm in both java embedded and traditional java me design embedded systems are typically designed to perform a specific task unlike a generalpurpose computer that strives to handle multiple tasks with equal efficiency some embedded systems also have realtime performance constraints for safety and usability; others may have little or no performance requirements allowing the system hardware to be simplified to reduce costs as such developers should use the simplest application design possible to avoid overtaxing the embedded system memory resources are frequently limited in embedded devices often memory is the most valuable resource many embedded devices have memory that is measured in megabytes mb and some of it is used by the runtime operating system rtos leaving the remainder for use by the java vm and its applications be aware of how much memory is typically used by your application the rtos and the java vm this will vary from one embedded board to another by the time a java me embedded application exhausts all memory and is subject to an outofmemoryerror there are few options left the application must either force the vm to free any unnecessary memory using a systemgc call or if that doesn't work crash threads java threads are often an expensive resource with embedded java vms java embedded applications work best when using minimal application threads if you must create multithreaded code be sure to minimize the use of synchronized code which can be expensive on embedded devices as a general rule avoid using the timer class as an extra thread is created for each timer a common technique for creating java me embedded applications is to create a background thread in the startapp method of the midlet class and reuse it throughout the imlet lifecycle system callbacks system callback functions should never block and should return as soon as possible to avoid slowing down the cldc vm pay special attention to the following midlet methods • startapp java me optimization techniques a • pauseapp • midlet constructor inputoutput the record management system rms is an io resource that should be used carefully with any application that uses recordstore objects opening and closing operations should be minimized in addition strive to group reads and writes in one section of code as much as possible spreading recordstore read and writes across the application can slow down the application another common strategy when working with recordstore objects is to use buffers which reside in memory and are often faster this is a common technique • for reading record stores read the entire record into a buffer then parse the buffer • for writing record stores write to a single buffer then write the buffer to a record general tips here are some other general hints for optimizing your code that are pervasive throughout the industry for java me code • object creation is very costly with respect to memory and performance overhead create objects only when needed and reuse any object instances that are created in a cache • use lazy instantiation if appropriate however many java me developers will create all objects outside the main loop of the program and reuse them as the application runs with reusable objects be sure to include a method that returns them to the original state independent of the object constructor • avoid autoboxing when possible • do not perform assertions in tight loops • avoid using variablelength arguments varargs • use local variables instead of global variables when you can local variables are faster and generate less bytecode • only include system classes that you need avoid using wild character imports like import javautil instead import classes directly such as import javautildate • don't perform string concatenations using the + operator use the stringbuffer class instead for example don't do the following string str = new string hello ;str += world; instead do this stringbuffer str = new stringbuffer hello ;strappendworld; remember that in java string objects are immutable so performing concatenation with the + operator will in fact create a stringbuffer copy the contents of the string over append the other string then copy the result back into a different immutable string object inputoutput a developer’s guide • divide your multidimensional arrays into singledimensional arrays multidimensional arrays take more time to calculate the proper index in memory • avoid any unnecessary creation and disposal of objects and variables inside loops for example avoid a construct like this for int i = ; i length; i++ myconstantclass c = new myconstantclass; resultsi = cdosomething; • use a switchcase construct instead of if blocks as they are compiled into more optimized bytecode remember that starting with java the switch keyword can handle strings which is more efficient that creating a large number of if blocks that test using the equals method • use public variables directly instead of using getset accessors • set variables to null when you don't need them anymore to assist with garbage collection application size aside from minimizing the number of classes in your application developers can also make use of obfuscator tools which are present in netbeans and other idess the original purpose of an obfuscator is to make reverse engineering bytecode more difficult however it can also create smaller and often faster class files in fact obfuscators typically reduce java me embedded class file size by % to % the netbeans ide contains an option to install the proguard obfuscator library you can choose this option by rightclicking on your project and bringing up the project properties next expand the build leaf and select obfuscating if progaurd is not already installed press the button to download and install the netbeans module as shown in figure a application size java me optimization techniques a figure a installing the proguard obfuscator library once the obfuscator is installed choose an obfuscation level by moving the slider anywhere from level and level as shown in figure a each level presents a detailed description in the window below that shows what operations the obfuscator is performing figure a choosing an obfuscation level application size a developer’s guide b java me embedded properties this appendix documents the configurable options that are found in many ports of the oracle java me embedded product system properties in the oracle java me embedded distribution can be configured in one of two ways by modifying the jwcpropertiesini file if available or by using the vm proxy commandline interface cli modifying the properties file most platforms have a jwcpropertiesini file that can be modified with a text editor the jwcpropertiesini file has two distinct sections • application properties that are used by java applications that are running on the board • internal properties used for internal system configuration in addition each jwcpropertiesini file contains comments that help describe the purpose of each entry it is highly recommend that you read through the original jwcpropertiesini file for your target embedded board as it contains essential information about each property note that the oracle java me embedded runtime may alter the values inside of the jwcpropertiesini file at any time especially if the setproperty and saveproperties commands are issued in the cli and typically without comments so it helps to study the original version that comes with each distribution bundle using the commandline interface in addition to specifying properties in the jwcpropertiesini file system properties can also be modified on the fly using the cli setproperty command the setproperty command uses the following syntax setproperty key value if you wish to examine the current value of any property use the getproperty command getproperty key note that after any property change the vm state is unpredictable and it is necessary to issue the saveproperties command and 'shutdown r' or depending on the embedded board cycle the power to activate the changes see chapter for more information on using the vm proxy cli java me embedded properties b the list of configurable system properties differs extensively on each platform and with each release and may be retrieved by issuing the following command via the cli proxy propertieslist for example the properties list that is generated for the raspberry pi would look similar to the following read only string xmlrpcsubsetversion = readwrite string xmljaxpsubsetversion = readwrite bool vmconfigsystemreboot = false read only string systemstorageroot = appdb readwrite bool systemnetworkreconnect =

securitysensitive apis signing an imlet suite's jar file allows the suite to be trusted a jar file is signed with the jadtool utility a copy of the jadtool utility is provided with the oracle java me embedded software bundle the jadtool utility signs a jar file by adding a certificate and the jar file's digital signature to a java application descriptor jad file adding a certificate and a jar file's digital signature to a jad file are separate steps you must complete both steps to sign a jar file the steps are in “instructions for using jadtool” you can also use the jadtool utility to obtain information about a certificate in a jad file the information can include the name of the entity that issued the certificate the certificate's serial number the dates between which it is valid and its message digest algorithm md and secure hash algorithm sha fingerprints instructions for using jadtool this section explains how to use the jadtool utility through an example that signs a hypothetical imlet suite named imaginaryimlet note imaginaryimlet is not an actual imlet suite no imaginaryimlet files are included with this release the example uses the key pair provided with the software the key pair is in the jsetestkeystorebin file which is a keystore managed with the java se platform's keytool utility for information on the keytool utility see http downloadoraclecomjavasedocstechnotestoolswindows keytoolhtml after you build an implementation of the software jsetestkeystorebin is located in this directory outputdirmeepbini where outputdir is the directory that contains the output of your builds of the oracle java me embedded software the password for the file is keystorepwd the alias of the key pair is dummyca the private key password is keypwd the file is provided for testing purposes for imlet suites on enduser devices use an rsa key pair backed by a certificate or certificate chain from a certificate authority you must import the certificate or certificate chain into a java se platform's keystore with the java se platform's keytool utility signing an imlet suite's jar file c the jadtool utility is packaged in a jar file named jadtooljar in this directory where ojmeedir is the base directory of the oracle java me embedded installation ojmeedir\toolkitlib\process\jadtool\code using the jadtool utility open a windows command prompt change your current directory to the directory that holds your imlet's jar and jad files add the certificate for your key pair to the jad file using the jadtool utility the jadtool utility adds the certificate as the value of an attribute named midletcertificatemn where m is the number of the certificate chain it defaults to one but you can provide a different number with the chainnum switch and n is an integer that for new certificates begins at one and increments by one each time you add a new certificate to the jad file for example if outputdirbinaries is c\jme\src\output\binaries the following command adds the certificate as the value of the attribute midletcertificate to the example jad file c\myimletsjava jar %ojmeehome%\toolkitlib\process \jadtool\code\jadtooljar addcert alias dummyca storepass keystorepwd keystore c\jme\src\output\midp\bin \i\jsetestkeystorebin inputjad imaginaryimletjad outputjad imaginaryimletjad optional verify that the certificate is added to the jad

md fecddbbfb sha dccecdefebfbdfedac if you have a key pair backed by a certificate chain import the intermediate certificates import the intermediate certificates using the jadtool utility with the addcert switch shown in step taking care to use the correct chain order for example the xxxx company provides a certificate that vouches for your key pair the widgetcertificates company vouches for the xxxx certificate and verisign vouches for the widgetcertificates certificate import the xxxx certificate followed by the widgetcertificate the xxxx certificate is midletcertificate and the widgetcertificate certificate is midletcertificate using the jadtool utility c developer’s guide note you do not import the certificate of the root ca in this example the certificate is from verisign the root certificate is on the device sign the jar file using the jadtool utility the jadtool utility signs the jar file base encodes the signature and stores it as the value of the midletjarrsasha attribute of the output jad file note the key used to sign the jar file must be from the same java se keystore entry as key pair specified in step the jadtool utility does not check that the jar file is signed with a keystore entry that has a certificate in the jad file for example c\myimletsjava jar %ojmeehome%\toolkitlib\process \jadtool\code\jadtooljar addjarsig keystore c\jme\src \output\midp\bin\i\jsetestkeystorebin alias dummyca storepass keystorepwd keypass keypwd jarfile imaginaryimletjar chainnum inputjad imaginaryimletjad outputjad imaginaryimletjad optionally you can

storepass keystorepwd keypass keypwd jarfile imaginaryimletjar inputjad imaginaryimletjad outputjad imaginarysignedshaimletjad handling expired certificates a jad file can have multiple certificate but it can hold the signature for only one jar file when a certificate in the jad file expires you must add a new certificate and resign the jar file when resigning the jar file the jadtool utility overwrites the current digital signature with the new one options summary the jadtool utility supports the following options • none running the tool without options returns the same information as the help option • addcert alias keyalias keystore keystore  storepass password  chainnum chainnumber  certnum certnumber  encoding encoding inputjad inputjadfile outputjad outputjadfile adds a certificate to a jad file to add a certificate this utility first creates the certificate from the entry identified by keyalias in keystore the keystore if provided must be a java cryptography architecture keystore a file containing data such as key handling expired certificates signing an imlet suite's jar file c entries in a format that the java se platform can use if keystore is not provided its default userhomedirkeystore is used if keystore requires a password to access its contents password must be provided after creating the certificate and attribute name this utility concatenates the contents of inputjadfile with the new certificate and writes it as outputjadfile you can use the same file for the inputjadfile and outputjadfile the certificate is in the jad file as the value of an attribute named midletcertificatemn where • m is chainnumber or if it is not provided a jad file can contain multiple certificate chain • n is certnumber the value certnumber depends on whether the new certificate replaces an existing certificate if the certificate is a replacement then certnumber must be the number of the certificate to replace for example if the new certificate would replace the one stored as the value of attribute midletcertificate then certnumber must be if the certificate is new certnumber is ignored if inputjadfile uses an encoding other than utf ascii with unicode

the emsapkcsv encoding method of pkcs # version see rfc at http wwwietforgrfcrfctxt after creating the signature this utility concatenates the contents of inputjadfile with the signature and writes it as outputjadfile the signature is base encoded and is in the output jad file as the value of the midletjarrsasham attribute where m is chainnumber or if it is not provided this number corresponds to the value for m in the midletcertificatemn attribute if inputjadfile uses an encoding other than utf ascii with unicode escapes encoding must be specified this utility uses the same encoding for

developer’s guide prints information about either all certificates or the certificate that corresponds to the given certnumber and chainnumber in the inputjadfile the option all cannot be combined with the certnum and chainnum options the chainnumber of a certificate is the m in the jad file's midletcertificatemn attribute while the certnumber is the n for example to show the certificate that is the value of attribute midletcertificate the chainnumber must be and certnumber must be if certnumber or chainnumber are not provided and the all option is not used the utility uses a the information printed includes the certificate's subject issuer serial number dates between which it is valid and fingerprints md and sha the attributes in the subject and issuer names are shown in reverse order from what is in the certificate a side effect of using the java se platform certificate api as a result the names might not match what is returned from other tools that display a certificate's subject and issuer names if inputjadfile uses an encoding other than utf ascii with unicode escapes encoding must be specified the tool uses the same encoding for reading inputjadfile and writing outputjadfile options summary signing an imlet suite's jar file c options summary c developer’s guide d managing keys and certificates the oracle java me embedded platform uses public keys from a certificate authority ca to validate web sites and signed imlet suites the oracle java me embedded implementation also uses private keys from certificates to establish secure connections with client authentication when the platform uses a secure protocol to access a web site the site provides a certificate which is typically signed by a ca in the same manner signed imlet suites also contain a certificate that is signed by a ca the oracle java me embedded platform checks the validity of a certificate by using the ca's public key by signing a certificate a ca certifies the identify of the owner of the web site or imlet suite you can manage the ca certificates public keys and private keys on the embedded board by using the mekeytool utility the mekeytool utility is provided with the java me sdk distribution and is similar to the keytool utility provided with the java se platform except that mekeytool will also operate across a network on the keystores of an embedded device that is currently recognized by the oracle java me embedded device manager this chapter describes how to use mekeytool to manage keystores that are used by the oracle java me embedded emulator or recognized by the oracle java me sdk device manager running mekeytool mekeytool is an executable that can be found in the following location mesdkhomedir\bin\mekeytoolexe where mesdkhomedir is the base directory of the oracle java me embedded installation to connect to a keystore on an embedded board instead of the emulator add the xdevice option to reference a device currently recognized by the oracle java me embedded device manager mekeytoolexe xdeviceembeddedexternaldevice warning each embedded board may only accept a limited subset of commands depending on the functionality offered to list the functionality supported by the device embeddedexternaldevice for example you can use the emulator's xquery option emulatorexe xquery xdeviceembeddedexternaldevice managing keys and certificates d using the mekeytool utility open a command prompt or terminal window change your current directory to the location of the exe file shown above or add the directory to your current %path% run mekeytool with the options needed for example use the following command to display help mekeytoolexe help me keystores the mekeytool utility keeps the ca certificates public keys and private keys in an me keystore depending on the device the keystore is at the following locations where basedir is the base directory of the oracle java me embedded or oracle java me sdk installation table d location of keystores device location emulator basedirruntimesmeepappdbcerts embedded boards basedirappdbcerts if file system is accessible this keystore directory contains an index file named mainks and a set of certificate files the platform includes the key of one ca warning oracle does not recommend modifying the default keystore but instead modifying a copy either one that is usergenerated or in the working directory for the appropriate device working directory for the emulator when the oracle java me embedded emulator is first started it creates a working directory in userhomedirjavamesdkversionworkdeviceappdbcerts note that this is only the case for emulated devices such as embeddeddevice not devices that map to actual embedded boards such as embeddedexternaldevice next it copies all certificates and several other important files there be aware that deleting the working directory removes all device settings and of course any additions to the local keystore note the mekeytool utility enables you to import keys from java se keystores however you cannot use the mekeytool utility directly on a java se keystore for example if you try to use the mekeytool utility to view public keys in a java se keystore the utility displays an error message that the keystore is corrupted an me keystore has a different format java se platform using the mekeytool utility d developer’s guide keystores which have a format in accordance with the java cryptography architecture specification creating and managing multiple me keystores in addition to managing the public keys in the me keystore you can use the mekeytool utility to manage additional me keystores both with the emulator and some embedded boards that contain an accessible filesystem for example during testing you might want to have multiple keystores to run against one keystore could contain all the necessary testing keys a second keystore could contain a subset of the testing keys and a third keystore could contain an expired key creating alternate me keystores the mekeytool utility does not create a new me keystore directory the developer must create an empty keystore first consisting of a directory and an empty mainks file which can be copied from the keystore provided with the distribution bundle see importing a key for instructions on how to import a key managing alternate me keystores to manage a keystore other than the default use the import mekeystore option mekeytoolexe import mekeystore keystorename for example if you created an me keystore userhomedir\mykeys \settestkeysks that contains the keys that are needed to run a particular set of tests use the mekeytool command to manage that keystore mekeytoolexe import mekeystore userhomedirmykeys settestkeysks for all mekeytool commands you receive an error message if the file that you provide as an argument to mekeystore does not exist importing a key you can add a key to an me keystore by importing it from the java cryptography architecture keystore that comes with the java se platform or from a keystore that you create for more information on the keystore that comes with the java se platform see httpdownloadoraclecomjavasedocstechnotes toolswindowskeytoolhtml the file name for the java se keystore is keystore and the default location is in your home directory this file is created if you use the java se platform's keytool utility to create keys and you do not specify a different location the mekeytool utility references this keystore unless you use the keystore argument to specify a different keystore note if you use a java se keystore other than the default the new keystore might require a password the import option imports a key for example to add a key with an alias dummyca from the java se keystore jsetestkeystorebin that has a password importing a key managing keys and certificates d keystorepwd to the me keystore at userhomedirmykeys

unused keys for example if you added the public key of a test site with a selfsigned certificate during testing you can delete that key when testing is completed the delete command to the mekeytool utility removes a key from an me keystore the delete command requires one of the following options • owner ownername sets the string that describes the owner of the public key in a given keystore use the list command to print information about each key in the keystore the string in the command must match the one printed when you use the list command to the mekeytool utility see listing available keys for more information • number keynumber sets the number that a given keystore has assigned to each of its keys the number is greater than or equal to one use the list command to print the number that the keystore has assigned to each of its keys see listing available keys for more information the following examples show two ways to delete a key from the me keystore userhomedirmykeyssettestkeysks the keystore used in listing available keys • deleting a key by using its key numberc\mekeytoolexe delete number mekeystore mykeys \settestkeysks deleting a key managing

replacing a key some situations require that you replace a key such as when a key expires to replace a key first delete the old key then import the new key note if you import the new key before deleting the old one the mekeytool utility displays an error message that the owner of the key has a key in the me keystore mekeytool summary the mekeytool utility supports the following options • no

the binary runtime of the oracle java me embedded software using oem extensions the oracle java me embedded software enables you to extend the binary runtime by making your own java packages available to imlets as oem extensions you specify the location of the jar files that contain your packages in a configuration file and imlets can use those packages at run time to make your packages available to imlets as oem extensions follow these steps write the java classes in your package compile your classes preverify your classes create a jar file that contains your classes add the jar file to the

calculating engine the construction of which i have been so long superintending having been induced during the last ten years to visit a considerable number of workshops and factories both in england and on the continent for the purpose of endeavouring to make myself acquainted with the various resources of mechanical art i was insensibly led to apply to them those principles of generalization to which my other pursuits had naturally given rise the increased number of curious processes and interesting facts which thus came under my attention as well as of the reflections which they suggested induced me to believe that the publication of some of them might be of use to persons who propose to bestow their attention on those enquiries which i have only incidentally considered with this view it was my intention to have delivered the present work in the form of a course of lectures at cambridge; an intention which i was subsequently induced to alter the substance of a considerable portion of it has however appeared among the preliminary chapters of the mechanical part of the encyclopedia metropolitana i have not attempted to offer a complete enumeration of all the mechanical principles which regulate the application of machinery to arts and manufactures but i have endeavoured to present to the reader those which struck me as the most important either for understanding the actions of machines or for enabling the memory to classify and arrange the facts connected with their employment still less have i attempted to examine all the difficult questions of political economy which are intimately connected with such enquiries it was impossible not to trace or to imagine among the wide variety of facts presented to me some principles which seemed to pervade many establishments; and having formed such conjectures the desire to refute or to verify them gave an additional interest to the pursuit several of the principles which i have proposed appear to me to have been unnoticed before this was particularly the case with respect to the explanation i have given of the division of labour; but further enquiry satisfied me that i had been anticipated by m gioja and it is probable that additional research would enable me to trace most of the other principles which i had thought original to previous writers to whose merit i may perhaps be unjust from my want of acquaintance with the historical branch of the subject the truth however of the principles i have stated is of much more importance than their origin; and the utility of an enquiry into them and of establishing others more correct if these should be erroneous can scarcely admit of a doubt the difficulty of understanding the processes of manufactures has unfortunately been greatly overrated to examine them with the eye of a manufacturer so as to be able to direct others to repeat them does undoubtedly require much skill and previous acquaintance with the subject; but merely to apprehend their general principles and mutual relations is within the power of almost every person possessing a tolerable education those who possess rank in a manufacturing country can scarcely be excused if they are entirely ignorant of principles whose development has produced its greatness the possessors of wealth can scarcely be indifferent to processes which nearly or remotely have been the fertile source of their possessions those who enjoy leisure can scarcely find a more interesting and instructive pursuit than the examination of the workshops of their own country which contain within them a rich mine of knowledge too generally neglected by the wealthier classes it has been my endeavour as much as possible to avoid all technical terms and to describe in concise language the arts i have had occasion to discuss in touching on the more abstract principles of political economy after shortly stating the reasons on which they are founded i have endeavoured to support them by facts and anecdotes; so that whilst young persons might be amused and instructed by the illustrations those of more advanced judgement may find subject for meditation in the general conclusions to which they point i was anxious to support the principles which i have advocated by the observations of others and in this respect i found myself peculiarly fortunate the reports of committees of the house of commons upon various branches of commerce and manufactures and the evidence which they have at different periods published on those subjects teem with information of the most important kind rendered doubly valuable by the circumstances under which it has been collected from these sources i have freely taken and i have derived some additional confidence from the support they have afforded to my views  charles babbage dorset street manchester square june  footnote i am happy to avail myself of this occasion of expressing my obligations to the right hon manners sutton the speaker of the house of commons to whom i am indebted for copies of a considerable collection of those reports  preface to the second edition  in two months from the publication of the first edition of this volume three thousand copies were in the hands of the public very little was spent in advertisements; the booksellers instead of aiding impeded its sale; it formed no part of any popular series and yet the public in a few weeks purchased the whole edition some small part of this success perhaps was due to the popular exposition of those curious processes which are carried on in our workshops and to the endeavour to take a short view of the general principles which direct the manufactories of the country but the chief reason was the commanding attraction of the subject and the increasing desire to become acquainted with the pursuits and interests of that portion of the people which has recently acquired so large an accession of political influence  footnote i had good evidence of this fact from various quarters; and being desirous of verifying it i myself applied for a copy at the shop of a bookseller of respectability who is probably not aware that he refused to procure one even for its author  a greater degree of attention than i had expected has been excited by what i have stated in the first edition respecting the 'booktrade' until i had commenced the chapter 'on the separate cost of each process of a manufacture' i had no intention of alluding to that subject but the reader will perceive that i have throughout this volume wherever i could employed as illustrations objects of easy access to the reader; and in accordance with that principle i selected the volume itself when i arrived at the chapter 'on combinations of masters against the public' i was induced for the same reason to expose a combination connected with literature which in my opinion is both morally and politically wrong i entered upon this enquiry without the slightest feeling of hostility to that trade nor have i any wish unfavourable to it; but i think a complete reform in its system would add to its usefulness and respectability as the subject of that chapter has been much discussed i have thought it right to take a view of the various arguments which have been advanced and to offer my own opinion respecting their validityand there i should have left the subject content to allow my general character to plead for me against insinuations respecting my motivesbut as the remarks of some of my critics affect the character of another person i think it but just to state circumstances which will clearly disprove them mr fellowes of ludgate street who had previously been the publisher of some other volumes for me had undertaken the publication of the first edition of the present work a short time previous to its completion i thought it right to call his attention to the chapter in which the booktrade is discussed; with the view both of making him acquainted with what i had stated and also of availing myself of his knowledge in correcting any accidental error as to the facts mr fellowes 'differing from me entirely respecting the conclusions i had arrived at' then declined the publication of the volume if i had then chosen to apply to some of those other booksellers whose names appear in the committee of 'the trade' it is probable that they also would have declined the office of publishing for me; and had my object been to make a case against the trade such a course would have assisted me but i had no such feeling; and having procured a complete copy of the whole work i called with it on mr knight of pall mall east whom until that day i had never seen and with whom i had never previously had the slightest communication i left the book in mr knight's hands with a request that when he had read it i might be informed whether he would undertake the publication of it; and this he consented to do mr knight therefore is so far from being responsible for a single opinion in the present volume that he saw it only for a short time a few days previous to its publication it has been objected to me that i have exposed too freely the secrets of trade the only real secrets of trade are industry integrity and knowledge to the possessors of these no exposure can be injurious; and they never fail to produce respect and wealth the alterations in the present edition are so frequent that i found it impossible to comprise them in a supplement but the three new chapters 'on money as a medium of exchange'; 'on a new system of manufacturing'; and 'on the effect of machinery in reducing the demand for labour'; will shortly be printed separately for the use of the purchasers of the first edition i am inclined to attach some importance to the new system of manufacturing; and venture to throw it out with the hope of its receiving a full discussion among those who are most interested in the subject i believe that some such system of conducting manufactories would greatly increase the productive powers of any country adopting it; and that our own possesses much greater facilities for its application than other countries in the greater intelligence and superior education of the working classes the system would naturally commence in some large town by the union of some of the most prudent and active workmen; and their example if successful would be followed by others the small capitalist would next join them and such factories would go on increasing until competition compelled the large capitalist to adopt the same system; and ultimately the whole faculties of every man engaged in manufacture would be concentrated upon one objectthe art of producing a good article at the lowest possible costwhilst the moral effect on that class of the population would be useful in the highest degree since it would render character of far greater value to the workman than it is at present to one criticism which has been made this volume is perfectly open i have dismissed the important subject of the patentlaws in a few lines the subject presents in my opinion great difficulties and i have been unwilling to write upon it because i do not see my way i will only here advert to one difficulty what constitutes an invention? few simple mechanical contrivances are new; and most combinations may be viewed as species and classed under genera of more or less generality; and may in consequence be pronounced old or new according to the mechanical knowledge of the person who gives his opinion some of my critics have amused their readers with the wildness of the schemes i have occasionally thrown out; and i myself have sometimes smiled along with them perhaps it were wiser for present reputation to offer nothing but profoundly meditated plans but i do not think knowledge will be most advanced by that course; such sparks may kindle the energies of other minds more favourably circumstanced for pursuing the enquiries thus i have now ventured to give some speculations on the mode of blowing furnaces for smelting iron; and even supposing them to be visionary it is of some importance thus to call the attention of a large population engaged in one of our most extensive manufactures to the singular fact that fourfifths of the steam power used to blow their furnaces actually cools them i have collected with some pains the criticisms on the first edition of this work and have availed myself of much information which has been communicated to me by my friends for the improvement of the present volume if i have succeeded in expressing what i had to explain with perspicuity i am aware that much of this clearness is due to my friend dr fitton to whom both the present and the former edition are indebted for such an examination and correction as an author himself has very rarely the power to bestow  footnote several of these have probably escaped me and i shall feel indebted to any one who will inform my publisher of any future remarks  november section i introduction the object of the present volume is to point out the effects and the advantages which arise from the use of tools and machines;to endeavour to classify their modes of action;and to trace both the causes and the consequences of applying machinery to supersede the skill and power of the human arm a view of the mechanical part of the subject will in the first instance occupy our attention and to this the first section of the work will be devoted the first chapter of the section will contain some remarks on the general sources from whence the advantages of machinery are derived and the succeeding nine chapters will contain a detailed examination of principles of a less general character the eleventh chapter contains numerous subdivisions and is important from the extensive classification it affords of the arts in which copying is so largely employed the twelfth chapter which completes the first section contains a few suggestions for the assistance of those who propose visiting manufactories the second section after an introductory chapter on the difference between making and manufacturing will contain in the succeeding chapters a discussion of many of the questions which relate to the political economy of the subject it was found that the domestic arrangement or interior economy of factories was so interwoven with the more general questions that it was deemed unadvisable to separate the two subjects the concluding chapter of this section and of the work itself relates to the future prospects of manufactures as arising from the application of science  chapter  sources of the advantages arising from machinery and manufactures  there exists perhaps no single circumstance which distinguishes our country more remarkably from all others than the vast extent and perfection to which we have carried the contrivance of tools and machines for forming those conveniences of which so large a quantity is consumed by almost every class of the community the amount of patient thought of repeated experiment of happy exertion of genius by which our manufactures have been created and carried to their present excellence is scarcely to be imagined if we look around the rooms we inhabit or through those storehouses of every convenience of every luxury that man can desire which deck the crowded streets of our larger cities we shall find in the history of each article of every fabric a series of failures which have gradually led the way to excellence; and we shall notice in the art of making even the most insignificant of them processes calculated to excite our admiration by their simplicity or to rivet our attention by their unlookedfor results  the accumulation of skill and science which has been directed to diminish the difficulty of producing manufactured goods has not been beneficial to that country alone in which it is concentrated; distant kingdoms have participated in its advantages the luxurious natives of the east and the ruder inhabitants of the african desert are alike indebted to our looms the produce of our factories has preceded even our most enterprising travellers the cotton of india is conveyed by british ships round half our planet to be woven by british skill in the factories of lancashire it is again set in motion by british capital; and transported to the very plains whereon it grew is repurchased by the lords of the soil which gave it birth at a cheaper price than that at which their coarser machinery enables them to manufacture it themselves  the large proportion of the population of this country who are engaged in manufactures appears from the following table deduced from a statement in an essay on the distribution of wealth by the rev r jones for every hundred persons employed in agriculture there are     agriculturists nonagriculturists  in bengal     in italy     in france     in england     the fact that the proportion of nonagricultural to agricultural persons is continually increasing appears both from the report of the committee of the house of commons upon manufacturers' employment july and from the still later evidence of the last census; from which document the annexed table of the increase of population in our great manufacturing towns has been deduced increase of population per cent names of places      total manchester      glasgow       liverpool      nottingham      birmingham      great britain     thus in three periods of ten years during each of which the general population of the country has increased about per cent or about per cent upon the whole period of thirty years the population of these towns has on the average increased per cent after this statement there requires no further argument to demonstrate the vast importance to the wellbeing of this country of making the interests of its manufacturers well understood and attended to  the advantages which are derived from machinery and manufactures seem to arise principally from three sources the addition which they make to human power the economy they produce of human time the conversion of substances apparently common and worthless into valuable products  of additions to human power with respect to the first of these causes the forces derived from wind from water and from steam present themselves to the mind of every one; these are in fact additions to human power and will be considered in a future page there are however other sources of its increase by which the animal force of the individual is itself made to act with far greater than its unassisted power; and to these we shall at present confine our observations the construction of palaces of temples and of tombs seems to have occupied the earliest attention of nations just entering on the career of civilization; and the enormous blocks of stone moved from their native repositories to minister to the grandeur or piety of the builders have remained to excite the astonishment of their posterity long after the purposes of many of these records as well as the names of their founders have been forgotten the different degrees of force necessary to move these ponderous masses will have varied according to the mechanical knowledge of the people employed in their transport; and that the extent of power required for this purpose is widely different under different circumstances will appear from the following experiment which is related by m rondelet sur l'art de batir a block of squared stone was taken for the subject of experiment  weight of stone lbs  in order to drag this stone along the floor of the quarry roughly chiselled it required a force equal to lbs  the same stone dragged over a floor of planks required lbs  the same stone placed on a platform of wood and dragged over a floor of planks required lbs  after soaping the two surfaces of wood which slid over each other it required lbs  the same stone was now placed upon rollers of three inches diameter when it required to put it in motion along the floor of the quarry lbs  to drag it by these rollers over a wooden floor lbs  when the stone was mounted on a wooden platform and the same rollers placed between that and a plank floor it required lbs  from this experiment it results that the force necessary to move a stone along        part of its weight the roughly chiselled floor of its quarry is nearly along a wooden floor       by wood upon wood      if the wooden surfaces are soaped    with rollers on the floor of the quarry   on rollers on wood      on rollers between wood      at each increase of knowledge as well as on the contrivance of every new tool human labour becomes abridged the man who contrived rollers invented a tool by which his power was quintupled the workman who first suggested the employment of soap or grease was immediately enabled to move without exerting a greater effort more than three times the weight he could before  the economy of human time is the next advantage of machinery in manufactures so extensive and important is this effect that we might if we were inclined to generalize embrace almost all the advantages under this single head but the elucidation of principles of less extent will contribute more readily to a knowledge of the subject; and as numerous examples will be presented to the reader in the ensuing pages we shall restrict our illustrations upon this point as an example of the economy of time the use of gunpowder in blasting rocks may be noticed several pounds of powder may be purchased for a sum acquired by a few days' labour yet when this is employed for the purpose alluded to effects are frequently produced which could not even with the best tools be accomplished by other means in less than many months the dimensions of one of the blocks of limestone extracted from the quarries worked for the formation of the breakwater at plymouth were  ft long ft wide and ft deep this mass containing above cubic feet and weighing about tons was blasted three times two charges of lbs each were successively exploded in a hole feet deep the bore being inches at top and  inches at bottom lbs of powder were afterwards exploded in the rent formed by those operations each pound of gunpowder separated from the rock two tons of matter or nearly times its own weight the expense of the powder was l or nearly d per lb the boring occupied two men during a day and a half and cost about s; and the value of the produce was at that time about l  the simple contrivance of tin tubes for speaking through communicating between different apartments by which the directions of the superintendent are instantly conveyed to the remotest parts of an establishment produces a considerable economy of time it is employed in the shops and manufactories in london and might with advantage be used in domestic establishments particularly in large houses in conveying orders from the nursery to the kitchen or from the house to the stable its convenience arises not merely from saving the servant or workman useless journeys to receive directions but from relieving the master himself from that indisposition to give trouble which frequently induces him to forego a trifling want when he knows that his attendant must mount several flights of stairs to ascertain his wishes and after descending must mount again to supply them the distance to which such a mode of communication can be extended does not appear to have been ascertained and would be an interesting subject for enquiry admitting it to be possible between london and liverpool about

important improvement a glazier's apprentice when using a diamond set in a conical ferrule as was always the practice about twenty years since found great difficulty in acquiring the art of using it with certainty; and at the end of a seven years' apprenticeship many were found but indifferently skilled in its employment this arose from the difficulty of finding the precise angle at which the diamond cuts and of guiding it along the glass at the proper inclination when that angle is found almost the whole of the time consumed and of the glass destroyed in acquiring the art of cutting glass may now be saved by the use of an improved tool the gem is set in a small piece of squared brass with its edges nearly parallel to one side of the square a person skilled in its use now files away the brass on one side until by trial he finds that the diamond will make a clean cut when guided by keeping this edge pressed against a ruler the diamond and its mounting are now attached to a stick like a pencil by means of a swivel allowing a small angular motion thus even the beginner at once applies the cutting edge at the proper angle by pressing the side of the brass against a ruler; and even though the part he holds in his hand should deviate a little from the required angle it communicates no irregularity to the position of the diamond which rarely fails to do its office when thus employed the relative hardness of the diamond in different directions is a singular fact an experienced workman on whose judgement i can rely informed me that he has seen a diamond ground with diamond powder on a castiron mill for three hours without its being at all worn but that on changing its direction with respect to the grinding surface the same edge was ground away  employment of materials of little value the skins used by the goldbeater are produced from the offal of animals the hoofs of horses and cattle and other horny refuse are employed in the production of the prussiate of potash that beautiful yellow crystallized salt which is exhibited in the shops of some of our chemists the wornout saucepans and tinware of our kitchens when beyond the reach of the tinker's art are not utterly worthless we sometimes meet carts loaded with old tin kettles and wornout iron coalskuttles traversing our streets these have not yet completed their useful course; the less corroded parts are cut into strips punched with small holes and varnished with a coarse black varnish for the use of the trunkmaker who protects the edges and angles of his boxes with them; the remainder are conveyed to the manufacturing chemists in the outskirts of the town who employ them in combination with pyroligneous acid in making a black die for the use of calico printers  of tools the difference between a tool and a machine is not capable of very precise distinction; nor is it necessary in a popular explanation of those terms to limit very strictly their acceptation a tool is usually more simple than a machine; it is generally used with the hand whilst a machine is frequently moved by animal or steam power the simpler machines are often merely one or more tools placed in a frame and acted on by a moving power in pointing out the advantages of tools we shall commence with some of the simplest  to arrange twenty thousand needles thrown promiscuously into a box mixed and entangled in every possible direction in such a form that they shall be all parallel to each other would at first sight appear a most tedious occupation; in fact if each needle were to be separated individually many hours must be consumed in the process yet this is an operation which must be performed many times in the manufacture of needles; and it is accomplished in a few minutes by a very simple tool; nothing more being requisite than a small flat tray of sheet iron slightly concave at the bottom in this the needles are placed and shaken in a peculiar manner by throwing them up a very little and giving at the same time a slight longitudinal motion to the tray the shape of the needles assists their arrangement; for if two needles cross each other unless which is exceedingly improbable they happen to be precisely balanced they will when they fall on the bottom of the tray tend to place themselves side by side and the hollow form of the tray assists this disposition as they have no projection in any part to impede this tendency or to entangle each other they are by continually shaking arranged lengthwise in three or four minutes the direction of the shake is now changed the needles are but little thrown up but the tray is shaken endways; the result of which is that in a minute or two the needles which were previously arranged endways become heaped up in a wall with their ends against the extremity of the tray they are then removed by hundreds at a time with a broad iron spatula on which they are retained by the forefinger of the left hand as this parallel arrangement of the needles must be repeated many times if a cheap and expeditious method had not been devised the expense of the manufacture would have been considerably enhanced  another process in the art of making needles furnishes an example of one of the simplest contrivances which can come under the denomination of a tool after the needles have been arranged in the manner just described it is necessary to separate them into two parcels in order that their points may be all in one direction this is usually done by women and children the needles are placed sideways in a heap on a table in front of each operator just as they are arranged by the process above described from five to ten are rolled towards this person with the forefinger of the left hand; this separates them a very small space from each other and each in its turn is pushed lengthwise to the right or to the left according to the direction of the point this is the usual process and in it every needle passes individually under the finger of the operator a small alteration expedites the process considerably the child puts on the forefinger of its right hand a small cloth cap or fingerstall and rolling out of the heap from six to twelve needles he keeps them down by the forefinger of the left hand whilst he presses the forefinger of the right hand gently against their ends those which have the points towards the right hand stick into the fingerstall; and the child removing the finger of the left hand slightly raises the needles sticking into the cloth and then pushes them towards the left side those needles which had their eyes on the right hand do not stick into the finger cover and are pushed to the heap on the right side before the repetition of this process by means of this simple contrivance each movement of the finger from one side to the other carries five or six needles to their proper heap; whereas in the former method frequently only one was moved and rarely more than two or three were transported at one movement to their place  various operations occur in the arts in which the assistance of an additional hand would be a great convenience to the workman and in these cases tools or machines of the simplest structure come to our aid vices of different forms in which the material to be wrought is firmly grasped by screws are of this kind and are used in almost every workshop; but a more striking example may be found in the trade of the nailmaker some kinds of nails such as those used for defending the soles of coarse shoes called hobnails require a particular form of the head which is made by the stroke of a die the workman holds one end of the rod of iron out of which he forms the nails in his left hand; with his right hand he hammers the redhot end of it into a point and cutting the proper length almost off bends it nearly at a right angle he puts this into a hole in a small stakeiron immediately under a hammer which is connected with a treadle and has a die sunk in its surface corresponding to the intended form of the head; and having given one part of the form to the head with the small hammer in his hand he moves the treadle with his foot disengages the other hammer and completes the figure of the head; the returning stroke produced by the movement of the treadle striking the finished nail out of the hole in which it was retained without this substitution of his foot for another hand the workman would probably be obliged to heat the nails twice over  another though fortunately a less general substitution of tools for human hands is used to assist the labour of those who are deprived by nature or by accident of some of their limbs those who have had an opportunity of examining the beautiful contrivances for the manufacture of shoes by machinery which we owe to the fertile invention of mr brunel must have noticed many instances in which the workmen were enabled to execute their task with precision although labouring under the disadvantages of the loss of an arm or leg a similar instance occurs at liverpool in the institution for the blind where a machine is used by those afflicted with blindness for weaving sashlines; it is said to have been the invention of a person suffering under that calamity other examples might be mentioned of contrivances for the use the amusement or the instruction of the wealthier classes who labour under the same natural disadvantages these triumphs of skill and ingenuity deserve a double portion of our admiration when applied to mitigate the severity of natural or accidental misfortune; when they supply the rich with occupation and knowledge; when they relieve the poor from the additional evils of poverty and want  division of the objects of machinery there exists a natural although in point of number a very unequal division amongst machines they may be classed as; first those which are employed to produce power and as secondly those which are intended merely to transmit force and execute work the first of these divisions is of great importance and is very limited in the variety of its species although some of those species consist of numerous individuals of that class of mechanical agents by which motion is transmittedthe lever the pulley the wedge and many others it has been demonstrated that no power is gained by their use however combined whatever force is applied at one point can only be exerted at some other diminished by friction and other incidental causes; and it has been further proved that whatever is gained in the rapidity of execution is compensated by the necessity of exerting additional force these two principles long since placed beyond the reach of doubt cannot be too constantly borne in mind but in limiting our attempts to things which are possible we are still as we hope to shew possessed of a field of inexhaustible research and of advantages derived from mechanical skill which have but just begun to exercise their influence on our arts and may be pursued without limit contributing to the improvement the wealth and the happiness of our race  of those machines by which we produce power it may be observed that although they are to us immense acquisitions yet in regard to two of the sources of this powerthe force of wind and of waterwe merely make use of bodies in a state of motion by nature; we change the directions of their movement in order to render them subservient to our purposes but we neither add to nor diminish the quantity of motion in existence when we expose the sails of a windmill obliquely to the gale we check the velocity of a small portion of the atmosphere and convert its own rectilinear motion into one of rotation in the sails; we thus change the direction of force but we create no power the same may be observed with regard to the sails of a vessel; the quantity of motion given by them is precisely the same as that which is destroyed in the atmosphere if we avail ourselves of a descending stream to turn a waterwheel we are appropriating a power which nature may appear at first sight to be uselessly and irrecoverably wasting but which upon due examination we shall find she is ever regaining by other processes the fluid which is falling from a higher to a lower level carries with it the velocity due to its revolution with the earth at a greater distance from its centre it will therefore accelerate although to an almost infinitesimal extent the earth's daily rotation the sum of all these increments of velocity arising from the descent of all the falling waters on the earth's surface would in time become perceptible did not nature by the process of evaporation convey the waters back to their sources; and thus again by removing matter to a greater distance from the centre destroy the velocity generated by its previous approach  the force of vapour is another fertile source of moving power; but even in this case it cannot be maintained that power is created water is converted into elastic vapour by the combustion of fuel the chemical changes which thus take place are constantly increasing the atmosphere by large quantities of carbonic acid and other gases noxious to animal life the means by which nature decomposes these elements or reconverts them into a solid form are not sufficiently known but if the end could be accomplished by mechanical force it is almost certain that the power necessary to produce it would at least equal that which was generated by the original combustion man therefore does not create power; but availing himself of his knowledge of nature's mysteries he applies his talents to diverting a small and limited portion of her energies to his own wants and whether he employs the regulated action of steam or the more rapid and tremendous effects of gunpowder he is only producing on a small scale compositions and decompositions which nature is incessantly at work in reversing for the restoration of that equilibrium which we cannot doubt is constantly maintained throughout even the remotest limits of our system the operations of man participate in the character of their author; they are diminutive but energetic during the short period of their existence whilst those of nature acting over vast spaces and unlimited by time are ever pursuing their silent and resistless career  in stating the broad principle that all combinations of mechanical art can only augment the force communicated to the machine at the expense of the time employed in producing the effect it might perhaps be imagined that the assistance derived from such contrivances is small this is however by no means the case since the almost unlimited variety they afford enables us to exert to the greatest advantage whatever force we employ there is it is true a limit beyond which it is impossible to reduce the power necessary to produce any given effect but it very seldom happens that the methods first employed at all approach that limit in dividing the knotted root of a tree for fuel how very different will be the time consumed according to the nature of the tool made use of! the hatchet or the adze will divide it into small parts but will consume a large portion of the workman's time the saw will answer the same purpose more quickly and more effectually this in its turn is superseded by the wedge which rends it in a still shorter time if the circumstances are favourable and the workman skilful the time and expense may be still further reduced by the use of a small quantity of gunpowder exploded in holes judiciously placed in the block  when a mass of matter is to be removed a certain force must be expended; and upon the proper economy of this force the price of transport will depend a country must however have reached a high degree of civilization before it will have approached the limit of this economy the cotton of java is conveyed in junks to the coast of china; but from the seed not being previously separated threequarters of the weight thus carried is not cotton this might perhaps be justified in java by the want of machinery to separate the seed or by the relative cost of the operation in the two countries but the cotton itself as packed by the chinese occupies three times the bulk of an equal quantity shipped by europeans for their own markets thus the freight of a given quantity of cotton costs the chinese nearly twelve times the price to which by a proper attention to mechanical methods it might be reduced  notes  'the bandana handkerchiefs manufactured at glasgow have long superseded the genuine ones

diminishing friction that the drivers of sledges in amsterdam on which heavy goods are transported carry in their hand a rope soaked in tallow which they throw down from time to time before the sledge in order that by passing over the rope it may become greased  chapter  accumulating power  whenever the work to be done requires more force for its execution than can be generated in the time necessary for its completion recourse must be had to some mechanical method of preserving and condensing a part of the power exerted previously to the commencement of the process this is most frequently accomplished by a flywheel which is in fact nothing more than a wheel having a very heavy rim so that the greater part of its weight is near the circumference it requires great power applied for some time to put this into rapid motion; but when moving with considerable velocity the effects are exceedingly powerful if its force be concentrated upon a small object in some of the iron works where the power of the steamengine is a little too small for the rollers which it drives it is usual to set the engine at work a short time before the redhot iron is ready to be removed from the furnace to the rollers and to allow it to work with great rapidity until the fly has acquired a velocity rather alarming to those unused to such establishments on passing the softened mass of iron through the first groove the engine receives a great and very perceptible check; and its speed is diminished at the next and at each succeeding passage until the iron bar is reduced to such a size that the ordinary power of the engine is sufficient to roll it  the powerful effect of a large flywheel when its force can be concentrated on a point was curiously illustrated at one of the largest of our manufactories the proprietor was shewing to a friend the method of punching holes in iron plates for the boilers of steamengines he held in his hand a piece of sheetiron threeeighths of an inch thick which he placed under the punch observing after several holes had been made that the punch made its perforations more and more slowly he called to the engineman to know what made the engine work so sluggishly when it was found that the flywheel and punching apparatus had been detached from the steamengine just at the commencement of his experiment  another mode of accumulating power arises from lifting a weight and then allowing it to fall a man even with a heavy hammer might strike repeated blows upon the head of a pile without producing any effect but if he raises a much heavier hammer to a much greater height its fall though far less frequently repeated will produce the desired effect when a small blow is given to a large mass of matter as to a pile the imperfect elasticity of the material causes a small loss of momentum in the transmission of the motion from each particle to the succeeding one; and therefore it may happen that the whole force communicated shall be destroyed before it reaches the opposite extremity  the power accumulated within a small space by gunpowder is well known; and though not strictly an illustration of the subject discussed in this chapter some of its effects under peculiar circumstances are so singular that an attempt to explain them may perhaps be excused if a gun is loaded with ball it will not kick so much as when loaded with small shot; and amongst different kinds of shot that which is the smallest causes the greatest recoil against the shoulder a gun loaded with a quantity of sand equal in weight to a charge of snipeshot kicks still more if in loading a space is left between the wadding and the charge the gun either recoils violently or bursts if the muzzle of a gun has accidentally been stuck into the ground so as to be stopped up with clay or even with snow or if it be fired with its muzzle plunged into water the almost certain result is that it bursts the ultimate cause of these apparently inconsistent effects is that every force requires time to produce its effect; and if the time requisite for the elastic vapour within to force out the sides of the barrel is less than that in which the condensation of the air near the wadding is conveyed in sufficient force to drive the impediment from the muzzle then the barrel must burst if sometimes happens that these two forces are so nearly balanced that the barrel only swells; the obstacle giving way before the gun is actually burst the correctness of this explanation will appear by tracing step by step the circumstances which arise on discharging a gun loaded with powder confined by a cylindrical piece of wadding and having its muzzle filled with clay or some other substance having a moderate degree of resistance in this case the first effect of the explosion is to produce an enormous pressure on everything confining it and to advance the wadding through a very small space here let us consider it as at rest for a moment and examine its condition the portion of air in immediate contact with the wadding is condensed; and if the wadding were to remain at rest the air throughout the tube would soon acquire a uniform density but this would require a small interval of time; for the condensation next the wadding would travel with the velocity of sound to the other end from whence being reflected back a series of waves would be generated which aided by the friction of the tube would ultimately destroy the motion but until the first wave reaches the impediment at the muzzle the air can exert no pressure against it now if the velocity communicated to the wadding is very much greater than that of sound the condensation of the air immediately in advance of it may be very great before the resistance transmitted to the muzzle is at all considerable; in which case the mutual repulsion of the particles of air so compressed will offer an absolute barrier to the advance of the wadding if this explanation be correct the additional recoil when a gun is loaded with small shot or sand may arise in some measure from the condensation of the air contained between their particles; but chiefly from the velocity communicated by the explosion to those particles of the substances in immediate contact with the powder being greater than that with which a wave can be transmitted through them it also affords a reason for the success of a method of blasting rocks by filling the upper part of the hole above the powder with sand instead of clay rammed hard that the destruction of the gun barrel does not arise from the property possessed by fluids and in some measure also by sand and small shot of pressing equally in all directions and thus exerting a force against a large portion of the interior surface seems to be proved by a circumstance mentioned by le vaillant and other travellers that for the purpose of taking birds without injuring their plumage they filled the barrel of their fowling pieces with water instead of loading them with a charge of shot  the same reasoning explains a curious phenomenon which occurs in firing a still more powerfully explosive substance if we put a small quantity of fulminating silver upon the face of an anvil and strike it slightly with a hammer it explodes; but instead of breaking either the hammer or the anvil it is found that that part of the face of each in contact with the fulminating silver is damaged in this case the velocity communicated by the elastic matter disengaged may be greater than the velocity of a wave traversing steel; so that the particles at the surface are driven by the explosion so near to those next adjacent that when the compelling force is removed the repulsion of the particles within the mass drives back those nearer to the surface with such force that they pass beyond the limits of attraction and are separated in the shape of powder  i the success of the experiment of firing a tallow candle through a deal board would be explained in the same manner by supposing the velocity of a wave propagated through deal to be greater than that of a wave passing through tallow  ii the boiler of a steamengine sometimes bursts even during the escape of steam through the safetyvalve if the water in the boiler is thrown upon any part which happens to be red hot the steam formed in the immediate neighbourhood of that part expands with greater velocity than that with which a wave can be transmitted through the less heated steam; consequently one particle is urged against the next and an almost invincible obstacle is formed in the same manner as described in the case of the discharge of a gun if the safetyvalve is closed it may retain the pressure thus created for a short time and even when it is open the escape may not be sufficiently rapid to remove all impediment; there may therefore exist momentarily within the boiler pressures of various force varying from that which can just lift the safetyvalve up to that which is sufficient if exerted during an extremely small space of time to tear open the boiler itself  this reasoning ought however to be admitted with caution; and perhaps some inducement to examine it carefully may be presented by tracing it to extreme cases it would seem but this is not a necessary consequence that a gun might be made so long that it would burst although no obstacle filled up its muzzle it should also follow that if after the gun is charged the air were extracted from the barrel though the muzzle be then left closed the gun ought not to burst it would also seem to follow from the principle of the explanation that a body might be projected in air or other elastic resisting medium with such force that after advancing a very short space it should return in the same direction in which it was projected notes  see poisson's remarks ecole polytec cahier xxi p chapter  regulating power  uniformity and steadiness in the rate at which machinery works are essential both for its effect and its duration the first illustration which presents itself is that beautiful contrivance the governor of the steamengine which must immediately occur to all who are familiar with that admirable engine wherever the increased speed of the engine would lead to injurious or dangerous consequences this is applied; and it is equally the regulator of the waterwheel which drives a spinningjenny or of the windmills which drain our fens in the dockyard at chatham the descending motion of a large platform on which timber is raised is regulated by a governor; but as the weight is very considerable the velocity of this governor is still further checked by causing its motion to take place in water  another very beautiful contrivance for regulating the number of strokes made by a steamengine is used in cornwall it is called the cataract and depends on the time required to fill a vessel plunged in water the opening of the valve through which the fluid is admitted being adjustable at the will of the engineman  the regularity of the supply of fuel to the fire under the boilers of steamengines is another mode of contributing to the uniformity of their rate and also economizes the consumption of coal several patents have been taken out for methods of regulating this supply the general principle being to make the engine supply the fire with small quantities of fuel at regular intervals by means of a hopper and to make it diminish this supply when the engine works too quickly one of the incidental advantages of this plan is that by throwing on a very small quantity of coal at a time the smoke is almost entirely consumed the dampers of ashpits and chimneys are also in some cases connected with machines in order to regulate their speed  another contrivance for regulating the effect of machinery consists in a vane or fly of little weight but presenting a large surface this revolves rapidly and soon acquires a uniform rate which it cannot greatly exceed because any addition to its velocity produces a much greater addition to the resistance it meets with from the air the interval between the strokes on the bell of a clock is regulated in this way and the fly is so contrived that the interval may be altered by presenting the arms of it more or less obliquely to the direction in which they move this kind of fly or vane is generally used in the smaller kinds of mechanism and unlike the heavy fly it is a destroyer instead of a preserver of force it is the regulator used in musical boxes and in almost all mechanical toys  the action of a fly or vane suggests the principle of an instrument for measuring the altitude of mountains which perhaps deserves a trial since if it succeed only tolerably it will form a much more portable instrument than the barometer it is well known that the barometer indicates the weight of a column of the atmosphere above it whose base is equal to the bore of the tube it is also known that the density of the air adjacent to the instrument will depend both on the weight of air above it and on the heat of the air at that place if therefore we can measure the density of the air and its temperature the height of a column of mercury which it would support in the barometer can be found by calculation now the thermometer gives information respecting the temperature of the air immediately; and its density might be ascertained by means of a watch and a small instrument in which the number of turns made by a vane moved by a constant force should be registered the less dense the air in which the vane revolves the greater will be the number of its revolutions in a given time and tables could be formed from experiments in partially exhausted vessels aided by calculation from which if the temperature of the air and the number of revolutions of the vane are given the corresponding height of the barometer might be found notes  to persons who may be inclined to experiment upon this or any other instrument i would beg to suggest the perusal of the section 'on the art of observing' observations on the decline of science in england p fellowes chapter  increase and diminution of velocity  the fatigue produced on the muscles of the human frame does not altogether depend on the actual force employed in each effort but partly on the frequency with which it is exerted the exertion necessary to accomplish every operation consists of two parts one of these is the expenditure of force which is necessary to drive the tool or instrument; and the other is the effort required for the motion of some limb of the animal producing the action in driving a nail into a piece of wood one of these is lifting the hammer and propelling its head against the nail; the other is raising the arm itself and moving it in order to use the hammer if the weight of the hammer is considerable the former part will cause the greatest portion of the exertion if the hammer is light the exertion of raising the arm will produce the greatest part of the fatigue it does therefore happen that operations requiring very trifling force if frequently repeated will tire more effectually than more laborious work there is also a degree of rapidity beyond which the action of the muscles cannot be pressed  the most advantageous load for a porter who carries wood up stairs on his shoulders has been investigated by m coulomb; but he found from experiment that a man walking up stairs without any load and raising his burden by means of his own weight in descending could do as much work in one day as four men employed in the ordinary way with the most favourable load  the proportion between the velocity with which men or animals move and the weights they carry is a matter of considerable importance particularly in military affairs it is also of great importance for the economy of labour to adjust the weight of that part of the animal's body which is moved the weight of the tool it urges and the frequency of repetition of these efforts so as to produce the greatest effect an instance of the saving of time by making the same motion of the arm execute two operations instead of one occurs in the simple art of making the tags of bootlaces these tags are formed out of very thin tinned sheetiron and were formerly cut out of long strips of that material into pieces of such a breadth that when bent round they just enclosed the lace two pieces of steel have recently been fixed to the side of the shears by which each piece of tinnediron as soon as it is cut is bent into a semicylindrical form the additional power required for this operation is almost imperceptible and it is executed by the same motion of the arm which produces the cut the work is usually performed by women and children; and with the improved tool more than three times the quantity of tags is produced in a given time  whenever the work is itself light it becomes necessary in order to economize time to increase the velocity twisting the fibres of wool by the fingers would be a most tedious operation in the common spinningwheel the velocity of the foot is moderate but by a very simple contrivance that of the thread is most rapid a piece of catgut passing round a large wheel and then round a small spindle effects this change this contrivance is common to a multitude of machines some of them very simple in large shops for the retail of ribands it is necessary at short intervals to 'take stock' that is to measure and rewind every piece of riband an operation which even with this mode of shortening it is sufficiently tiresome but without it would be almost impossible from its expense the small balls of sewing cotton so cheap and so beautifully wound are formed by a machine on the same principle and but a few steps more complicated  in turning from the smaller instruments in frequent use to the larger and more important machines the economy arising from the increase of velocity becomes more striking in converting cast into wroughtiron a mass of metal of about a hundredweight is heated almost to white heat and placed under a heavy hammer moved by water or steam power this is raised by a projection on a revolving axis; and if the hammer derived its momentum only from the space through which it fell it would require a considerably greater time to give a blow but as it is important that the softened mass of redhot iron should receive as many blows as possible before it cools the form of the cam or projection on the axis is such that the hammer instead of being lifted to a small height is thrown up with a jerk and almost the instant after it strikes against a large beam which acts as a powerful spring and drives it down on the iron with such velocity that by these means about double the number of strokes can be made in a given time in the smaller tilthammers this is carried still further by striking the tail of the tilthammer forcibly against a small steel anvil it rebounds with such velocity that from three to five hundred strokes are made in a minute in the manufacture of anchors an art in which a similar contrivance is of still greater importance it has only been recently applied  in the manufacture of scythes the length of the blade renders it necessary that the workman should move readily so as to bring every part of it on the anvil in quick succession this is effected by placing him in a seat suspended by ropes from the ceiling so that he is enabled with little bodily exertion to vary his distance by pressing his feet against the block which supports the anvil or against the floor  an increase of velocity is sometimes necessary to render operations possible thus a person may skate with great rapidity over ice which would not support his weight if he moved over it more slowly this arises from the fact that time is requisite for producing the fracture of the ice as soon as the weight of the skater begins to act on any point the ice supported by the water bends slowly under him; but if the skater's velocity is considerable he has passed off from the spot which was loaded before the bending has reached the point which would cause the ice to break  an effect not very different from this might take place if very great velocity were communicated to boats let us suppose a flatbottomed boat whose bow forms an inclined plane with the bottom at rest in still water if we imagine some very great force suddenly to propel this boat the inclination of the plane at the forepart would cause it to rise in the water; and if the force were excessive it might even rise out of the water and advance by a series of leaps like a piece of slate or an oyster shell thrown as a 'duck and drake' if the force were not sufficient to pull the boat out of the water but were just enough to bring its bottom to the surface it would be carried along with a kind of gliding motion with great rapidity; for at every point of its course it would require a certain time before it could sink to its usual draft of water; but before that time had elapsed it would have advanced to another point and consequently have been raised by the reaction of the water on the inclined plane at its forepart  the same fact that bodies moving with great velocity have not time to exert the full effect of their weight seems to explain a circumstance which appears to be very unaccountable it sometimes happens that when footpassengers are knocked down by carriages the wheels pass over them with scarcely any injury though if the weight of the carriage had rested on their body even for a few seconds it would have crushed them to death if the view above taken is correct the injury in such circumstances will chiefly happen to that part of the body which is struck by the advancing wheel  an operation in which rapidity is of essential importance is in bringing the produce of mines up to the surface the shafts through which the produce is raised are sunk at a very great expense and it is of course desirable to sink as few of them as possible the matter to be extracted is therefore raised by steamengines with considerable velocity and without this many of our mines could not be worked with profit  the effect of great velocity in modifying the form of a cohesive substance is beautifully shown in the process for making window glass termed flashing which is one of the most striking operations in our domestic arts a workman having dipped his iron tube into the glass pot and loaded it with several pounds of the melted metal blows out a large globe which is connected with his rod by a short thick hollow neck another workman now fixes to the globe immediately opposite to its neck an iron rod the extremity of which has been dipped in the melted glass; and when this is firmly attached a few drops of water separate the neck of the globe from the iron tube the rod with the globe attached to it is now held at the mouth of a glowing furnace and by turning the rod the globe is made to revolve slowly so as to be uniformly exposed to the heat the first effect of this softening is to make the glass contract upon itself and to enlarge the opening of the neck as the softening proceeds the globe is turned more quickly on its axis and when very soft and almost incandescent it is removed from the fire and the velocity of rotation being still continually increased the opening enlarges from the effect of the centrifugal force at first gradually until at last the mouth suddenly expands or flashes out into one large circular sheet of red hot glass the neck of the original globe which is to become the outer part of the sheet is left thick to admit of this expansion and forms the edge of the circular plate of glass which is called a table the centre presents the appearance of a thick boss or prominence called the bull'seye at the part by which it was attached to the iron rod  the most frequent reason for employing contrivances for diminishing velocity arises from the necessity of overcoming great resistances with small power systems of pulleys the crane and many other illustrations might also be adduced here as examples; but they belong more appropriately to some of the other causes which we have assigned for the advantages of machinery the common smokejack is an instrument in which the velocity communicated is too great for the purpose required and it is transmitted through wheels which reduce it to a more moderate rate  telegraphs are machines for conveying information over extensive lines with great rapidity they have generally been established for the purposes of transmitting information during war but the increasing wants of man will probably soon render them subservient to more peaceful objects a few years since the telegraph conveyed to paris information of the discovery of a comet by m gambart at marseilles the message arrived during a sitting of the french board of longitude and was sent in a note from the minister of the interior to laplace the president who received it whilst the writer of these lines was sitting by his side the object in this instance was to give the earliest publicity to the fact and to assure to m gambart the title of its first discoverer at liverpool a system of signals is established for the purposes of commerce so that each merchant can communicate with his own vessel long before she arrives in the port notes  see transactions of the society of arts chapter  extending the time of action of forces  this is one of the most common and most useful of the employments of machinery the half minute which we daily devote to the windingup of our watches is an exertion of labour almost insensible; yet by the aid of a few wheels its effect is spread over the whole twentyfour hours in our clocks this extension of the time of action of the original force impressed is carried still further; the better kind usually require winding up once in eight days and some are occasionally made to continue in action during a month or even a year another familiar illustration may be noticed in our domestic furniture the common jack by which our meat is roasted is a contrivance to enable the cook in a few minutes to exert a force which the machine retails out during the succeeding hour in turning the loaded spit; thus enabling her to bestow her undivided attention on the other important duties of her vocation a great number of automatons and mechanical toys moved by springs may be classed under this division  a small moving power in the shape of a jack or a spring with a train of wheels is often of great convenience to the experimental philosopher and has been used with advantage in magnetic and electric experiments where the rotation of a disk of metal or other body is necessary thus allowing to the enquirer the unimpeded use of both his hands a vane connected by a train of wheels and set in motion by a heavy weight has also on some occasions been employed in chemical processes to keep a solution in a state of agitation another object to which a similar apparatus may be applied is the polishing of small specimens of minerals for optical experiments  chapter  saving time in natural operations  the process of tanning will furnish us with a striking illustration of the power of machinery in accelerating certain processes in which natural operations have a principal effect the object of this art is to combine a certain principle called tanning with every particle of the skin to be tanned this in the ordinary process is accomplished by allowing the skins to soak in pits containing a solution of tanning matter they remain in the pits six twelve or eighteen months; and in some instances if the hides are very thick they are exposed to the operation for two years or even during a longer period this length of time is apparently required in order to allow the tanning matter to penetrate into the interior of a thick hide the improved process consists in placing the hides with the solution of tan in close vessels and then exhausting the air the effect is to withdraw any air which may be contained in the pores of the hides and to aid capillary attraction by the pressure of the atmosphere in forcing the tan into the interior of the skins the effect of the additional force thus brought into action can be equal only to one atmosphere but a further improvement has been made the vessel containing the hides is after exhaustion filled up with a solution of tan; a small additional quantity is then injected with a forcingpump by these means any degree of pressure may be given which the containing vessel is capable of supporting; and it has been found that by employing such a method the thickest hides may be tanned in six weeks or two months  the same process of injection might be applied to impregnate timber with tar or any other substance capable of preserving it from decay and if it were not too expensive the deal floors of houses might thus be impregnated with alumine or other substances which would render them much less liable to be accidentally set on fire in some cases it might be useful to impregnate woods with resins varnish or oil; and wood saturated with oil might in some instances be usefully employed in machinery for giving a constant but very minute supply of that fluid to iron or steel against which it is worked some idea of the quantity of matter which can be injected into wood by great pressure may be formed from considering the fact stated by mr scoresby respecting an accident which occurred to a boat of one of our whalingships the harpoon having been struck into the fish the whale in this instance dived directly down and carried the boat along with him on returning to the surface the animal was killed but the boat instead of rising was found suspended beneath the whale by the rope of the harpoon; and on drawing it up every part of the wood was found to be so completely saturated with water as to sink immediately to the bottom  the operation of bleaching linen in the open air is one for which considerable time is necessary; and although it does not require much labour yet from the risk of damage and of robbery from long exposure a mode of shortening the process was highly desirable the method now practised although not mechanical is such a remarkable instance of the application of science to the practical purposes of manufactures that in mentioning the advantages derived from shortening natural operations it would have been scarcely pardonable to have omitted all allusion to the beautiful application of chlorine in combination with lime to the art of bleaching  another instance more strictly mechanical occurs in some countries where fuel is expensive and the heat of the sun is not sufficient to evaporate the water from brine springs the water is first pumped up to a reservoir and then allowed to fall in small streams through faggots thus it becomes divided; and presenting a large surface evaporation is facilitated and the brine which is collected in the vessels below the faggots is stronger than that which was pumped up after thus getting rid of a large part of the water the remaining portion is driven off by boiling the success of this process depends on the condition of the atmosphere with respect to moisture if the air at the time the brine falls through the faggots holds in solution as much moisture as it can contain in an invisible state no more can be absorbed from the salt water and the labour expended in pumping is entirely wasted the state of the air as to dryness is therefore an important consideration in fixing the time when this operation is to be performed; and an attentive examination of its state by means of the hygrometer might be productive of some economy of labour  in some countries where wood is scarce the evaporation of salt water is carried on by a large collection of ropes which are stretched perpendicularly in passing down the ropes the water deposits the sulphate of lime which it held in solution and gradually incrusts them so that in the course of twenty years when they are nearly rotten they are still sustained by the surrounding incrustation thus presenting the appearance of a vast collection of small columns  amongst natural operations perpetually altering the surface of our globe there are some which it would be advantageous to accelerate the wearing down of the rocks which impede the rapids of navigable rivers is one of this class a very beautiful process for accomplishing this object has been employed in america a boat is placed at the bottom of the rapid and kept in its position by a long rope which is firmly fixed on the bank of the river near the top an axis having a wheel similar to the paddlewheel of a steamboat fixed at each end of it is placed across the boat; so that the two wheels and their connecting axis shall revolve rapidly being driven by the force of the passing current let us now imagine several beams of wood shod with pointed iron fixed at the ends of strong levers projecting beyond the bow of the boat as in the annexed representation if these levers are at liberty to move up and down and if one or more projecting pieces called cams are fixed on the axis opposite to the end of each lever the action of the stream upon the wheels will keep up a perpetual succession of blows the sharppointed shoe striking upon the rock at the bottom will continually detach small pieces which the stream will immediately carry off thus by the mere action of the river itself a constant and most effectual system of pounding the rock at its bottom is established a single workman may by the aid of a rudder direct the boat to any required part of the stream; and when it is necessary to move up the rapid as the channel is cut he can easily cause the boat to advance by means of a capstan  when the object of the machinery just described has been accomplished and the channel is sufficiently deep a slight alteration converts the apparatus to another purpose almost equally advantageous the stampers and the projecting pieces on the axis are removed and a barrel of wood or metal surrounding part of the axis and capable at pleasure of being connected with or disconnected from the axis itself is substituted the rope which hitherto fastened the boat is now fixed to this barrel; and if the barrel is loose upon the axis the paddlewheel makes the axis only revolve and the boat remains in its place but the moment the axis is attached to its surrounding barrel this begins to turn and winding up the rope the boat is gradually drawn up against the stream; and may be employed as a kind of tugboat for vessels which have occasion to ascend the rapid when the tugboat reaches the summit the barrel is released from the axis and friction being applied to moderate its velocity the boat is allowed to descend  clocks occupy a very high place amongst instruments by means of which human time is economized and their multiplication in conspicuous places in large towns is attended with many advantages their position nevertheless in london is often very ill chosen; and the usual place halfway up on a high steeple in the midst of narrow streets in a crowded city is very unfavourable unless the church happen to stand out from the houses which form the street the most eligible situation for a clock is that it should project considerably into the street at some elevation with a dialplate on each side like that which belonged to the old church of st dunstan in fleet street so that passengers in both directions would have their attention directed to the hour  a similar remark applies with much greater force to the present defective mode of informing the public of the position of the receiving houses for the twopenny and general post in the lowest corner of the window of some attractive shop is found a small slit with a brass plate indicating its important office so obscurely that it seems to be an object rather to prevent its being conspicuous no striking sign assists the anxious enquirer who as the moments rapidly pass which precede the hour of closing torments the passenger with his enquiries for the nearest postoffice he reaches it perhaps just as it is closed; and must then either hasten to a distant part of the town in order to procure the admission of his letters or give up the idea of forwarding them by that post; and thus if they are foreign letters he may lose perhaps a week or a fortnight by waiting for the next packet the inconvenience in this and in some other cases is of perpetual and everyday occurrence; and though in the greater part of the individual cases it may be of trifling moment the sum of all these produces an amount which it is always worthy of the government of a large and active population to attend to the remedy is simple and obvious it would only be necessary at each letterbox to have a light frame of iron projecting from the house over the pavement and carrying the letters g p or t p or any other distinctive sign all private signs are at present very properly prohibited from projecting into the street the passenger therefore would at once know where to direct his attention in order to discover a postoffice; and those letterboxes which occurred in the great thoroughfares could not fail to be generally known  chapter  exerting forces too great for human power and executing operations too delicate for human touch  it requires some skill and a considerable apparatus to enable many men to exert their whole force at a given point; and when this number amounts to hundreds or to thousands additional difficulties present themselves if ten thousand men were hired to act simultaneously it would be exceedingly difficult to discover whether each exerted his whole force and consequently to be assured that each man did the duty for which he was paid and if still larger bodies of men or animals were necessary not only would the difficulty of directing them become greater but the expense would increase from the necessity of transporting food for their subsistence the difficulty of enabling a large number of men to exert their force at the same instant of time has been almost obviated by the use of sound the whistle of the boatswain performs this service on board ships; and in removing by manual force the vast mass of granite weighing above tons on which the equestrian figure of peter the great is placed at st petersburgh a drummer was always stationed on its summit to give the signal for the united efforts of the workmen an ancient egyptian drawing was discovered a few years since by champollion in which a multitude of men appeared harnessed to a huge block of stone on the top of which stood a single individual with his hands raised above his head apparently in the act of clapping them for the purpose of insuring the exertion of their combined force at the same moment of time  in mines it is sometimes necessary to raise or lower great weights by capstans requiring the force of more than one hundred men these work upon the surface; but the directions must be communicated from below perhaps from the depth of two hundred fathoms this communication however is accomplished with ease and certainty by signals the usual apparatus is a kind of clapper placed on the surface close to the capstan so that every man may hear and put in motion from below by a rope passing up the shaft at wheal friendship mine in cornwall a different contrivance is employed there is in that mine an inclined plane passing underground about twothirds of a mile in length signals are communicated by a continuous rod of metal which being struck below the blow is distinctly heard on the surface  in all our larger manufactories numerous instances occur of the application of the power of steam to overcome resistances which it would require far greater expense to surmount by means of animal labour the twisting of the largest cables the rolling hammering and cutting large masses of iron the draining of our mines all require enormous exertions of physical force continued for considerable periods of time other means are had recourse to when the force required is great and the space through which it is to act is small the hydraulic press of bramah can by the exertion of one man produce a pressure of atmospheres; and with such an instrument a hollow cylinder of wrought iron three inches thick has been burst in rivetting together the iron plates out of which steamengine boilers are made it is necessary to produce as close a joint as possible this is accomplished by using the rivets redhot while they are in that state the two plates of iron are rivetted together and the contraction which the rivet undergoes in cooling draws them together with a force which is only limited by the tenacity of the metal of which the rivet itself is made  it is not alone in the greater operations of the engineer or the manufacturer that those vast powers which man has called into action in availing himself of the agency of steam are fully developed wherever the individual operation demanding little force for its own performance is to be multiplied in almost endless repetition commensurate power is required it is the same 'giant arm' which twists 'the largest cable' that spins from the cotton plant an 'almost gossamer thread' obedient to the hand which called into action its resistless powers it contends with the ocean and the storm and rides triumphant through dangers and difficulties unattempted by the older modes of navigation it is the same engine that in its more regulated action weaves the canvas it may one day supersede or with almost fairy fingers entwines the meshes of the most delicate fabric that adorns the female form  the fifth report of the select committee of the house of commons on the holyhead roads furnishes ample proof of the great superiority of steam vessels the following extracts are taken from the evidence of captain rogers the commander of one of the packets question are you not perfectly satisfied from the experience you have had that the steam vessel you command is capable of performing what no sailing vessel can do? answer yes question during your passage from gravesend to the downs could any squarerigged vessel from a firstrate down to a sloop of war have performed the voyage you did in the time you did it in the steamboat? answer no it was impossible in the downs we passed several indiamen and sail there that could not move down the channel and at the back of dungeness we passed more question at the time you performed that voyage with the weather you have described from the downs to milford if that weather had continued twelve months would any squarerigged vessel have performed it? answer they would have been a long time about it probably would have been weeks instead of days a sailing vessel would not have beat up to milford as we did in twelve months  the process of printing on the silver paper which is necessary for banknotes is attended with some inconvenience from the necessity of damping the paper previously to taking the impression it was difficult to do this uniformly and in the old process of dipping a parcel of several sheets together into a vessel of water the outside sheets becoming much more wet than the others were very apt to be torn a method has been adopted at the bank of ireland which obviates this inconvenience the whole quantity of paper to be damped is placed in a close vessel from which the air is exhausted; water is then admitted and every leaf is completely wetted; the paper is then removed to a press and all the superfluous moisture is squeezed out  the operation of pulverizing solid substances and of separating the powders of various degrees of fineness is common in the arts and as the best graduated sifting fails in effecting this separation with sufficient delicacy recourse is had to suspension in a fluid medium the substance when reduced by grinding to the finest powder is agitated in water which is then drawn off the coarsest portion of the suspended matter first subsides and that which requires the longest time to fall down is the finest in this manner even emery powder a substance of great density is separated into the various degrees of fineness which are required flints after being burned and ground are suspended in water in order to mix them intimately with clay which is also suspended in the same fluid for the formation of porcelain the water is then in part evaporated by heat and the plastic compound out of which our most beautiful porcelain is formed remains it is a curious fact and one which requires further examination than it has yet received that if this mixture be suffered to remain long at rest before it is worked up it becomes useless; for it is then found that the silex which at first was uniformly mixed becomes aggregated together in small lumps this parallel to the formation of flints in the chalk strata deserves attention  the slowness with which powders subside depends partly on the specific gravity of the substance and partly on the magnitude of the particles themselves bodies in falling through a resisting medium after a certain time acquire a uniform velocity which is called their terminal velocity with which they continue to descend when the particles are very small and the medium dense as water this terminal velocity is soon arrived at some of the finer powders even of emery require several hours to subside through a few feet of water and the mud pumped up into our cisterns by some of the water companies is suspended during a still longer time these facts furnish us with some idea of the great extent over which deposits of river mud may be spread; for if the mud of any river whose waters enter the gulf stream sink through one foot in an hour it might be carried by that stream miles before it had sunk to the depth of or feet  a number of small filaments of cotton project from even the best spun thread and when this thread is woven into muslin they injure its appearance to cut these off separately is quite impossible but they are easily removed by passing the muslin rapidly over a cylinder of iron kept at a dull red heat the time during which each portion of the muslin is in contact with the redhot iron is too short to heat it to the burning point; but the filaments being much finer and being pressed close to the hot metal are burnt the removal of these filaments from patent net is still more necessary for its perfection the net is passed at a moderate velocity through a flame of gas issuing from a very long and narrow slit immediately above the flame a long funnel is fixed which is connected with a large airpump worked by a steamengine the flame is thus drawn forcibly through the net and all the filaments on both sides of it are burned off at one operation previously to this application of the airpump the net acting in the same way although not to the same extent as the wiregauze in davy's safety lamp cooled down the flame so as to prevent the combustion of the filaments on the upper side the airpump by quickening the current of ignited gas removes this inconvenience notes  the importance and diversified applications of the steam engine were most ably enforced in the speeches made at a public meeting held june for the purpose of proposing the erection of a monument to the memory of james watt; these were subsequently printed  some observations on the subject by dr fitton occur in the appendix to captain king's survey of the coast of australia vol ii p london chapter  registering operations  one great advantage which we may derive from machinery is from the check which it affords against the inattention the idleness or the dishonesty of human agents few occupations are more wearisome than counting a series of repetitions of the same fact; the number of paces we walk affords a tolerably good measure of distance passed over but the value of this is much enhanced by possessing an instrument the pedometer which will count for us the number of steps we have made a piece of mechanism of this kind is sometimes applied to count the number of turns made by the wheel of a carriage and thus to indicate the distance travelled an instrument similar in its object but differing in its construction has been used for counting the number of strokes made by a steamengine and the number of coins struck in a press one of the simplest instruments for counting any series of operations was contrived by mr donkin  another instrument for registering is used in some establishments for calendering and embossing many hundred thousand yards of calicoes and stuffs undergo these operations weekly; and as the price paid for the process is small the value of the time spent in measuring them would bear a considerable proportion to the profit a machine has therefore been contrived for measuring and registering the length of the goods as they pass rapidly through the hands of the operator by which all chance of erroneous counting is avoided  perhaps the most useful contrivance of this kind is one for ascertaining the vigilance of a watchman it is a piece of mechanism connected with a clock placed in an apartment to which the watchman has not access; but he is ordered to pull a string situated in a certain part of his round once in every hour the instrument aptly called a telltale informs the owner whether the man has missed any and what hours during the night  it is often of great importance both for regulations of excise as well as for the interest of the proprietor to know the quantity of spirits or of other liquors which have been drawn off by those persons who are allowed to have access to the vessels during the absence of the inspectors or principals this may be accomplished by a peculiar kind of stopcockwhich will at each opening discharge only a certain measure of fluid the number of times the cock has been turned being registered by a counting apparatus accessible only to the master  the time and labour consumed in gauging the contents of casks partly filled has led to an improvement which by the simplest means obviates a considerable inconvenience and enables any person to read off on a scale the number of gallons contained in any vessel as readily as he does the degree of heat indicated by his thermometer a small stopcock connects the bottom of the cask with a glass tube of narrow bore fixed to a scale on the side of the cask and rising a little above its top the plug of the cock may be turned into three positions in the first it cuts off all communication with the cask in the second it opens a communication between the cask and the glass tube and in the third it cuts off the connection between the cask and the tube and opens a communication between the tube and any vessel held beneath the cock to receive its contents the scale of the tube is graduated by pouring into the cask successive quantities of water while the communication between the cask and the tube is open lines are then drawn on the scale opposite the places in the tube to which the water rises at each addition and the scale being thus formed by actual measurement the contents of each cask are known by inspection and the tedious process of gauging is altogether dispensed with other advantages accrue from this simple contrivance in the great economy of time which it introduces in making mixtures of different spirits in taking stock and in receiving spirit from the distiller  the gasmeter by which the quantity of gas used by each consumer is ascertained is another instrument of this kind they are of various forms but all of them intended to register the number of cubic feet of gas which has been delivered it is very desirable that these meters should be obtainable at a moderate price and that every consumer should employ them; because by making each purchaser pay only for what he consumes and by preventing that extravagant waste of gas which we frequently observe the manufacturer of gas will be enabled to make an equal profit at a diminished price to the consumer  the sale of water by the different companies in london might also with advantage be regulated by a meter if such a system were adopted much water which is now allowed to run to waste would be saved and an unjust inequality between the rates charged on different houses by the same company be avoided  another most important object to which a meter might be applied would be to register the quantity of water passing into the boilers of steamengines without this our knowledge of the quantity evaporated by different boilers and with fireplaces of different constructions as well as our estimation of the duty of steamengines must evidently be imperfect  another purpose to which machinery for registering operations is applied with much advantage is the determination of the average effect of natural or artificial agents the mean height of the barometer for example is ascertained by noting its height at a certain number of intervals during the twentyfour hours the more these intervals are contracted the more correctly will the mean be ascertained; but the true mean ought to be influenced by each momentary change which has occurred clocks have been proposed and made with this object by which a sheet of paper is moved slowly and uniformly before a pencil fixed to a float upon the surface of the mercury in the cup of the barometer sir david brewster proposed several years ago to suspend a barometer and swing it as a pendulum the variations in the atmosphere would thus alter the centre of oscillation and the comparison of such an instrument with a good clock would enable us to ascertain the mean altitude of the barometer during any interval of the observer's absence an instrument for measuring and registering the quantity of rain was invented by mr john taylor and described by him in the philosophical magazine it consists of an apparatus in which a vessel that receives the rain falling into the reservoir tilts over as soon as it is full and then presents another similar vessel to be filled which in like manner when full tilts the former one back again the number of times these vessels are emptied is registered by a train of wheels; and thus without the presence of the observer the quantity of rain falling during a whole year may be measured and recorded instruments might also be contrived to determine the average force of traction of horsesof the windof a stream or of any irregular and fluctuating effort of animal or other natural force  clocks and watches may be considered as instruments for registering the number of vibrations performed by a pendulum or a balance the mechanism by which these numbers are counted is technically called a scapement it is not easy to describe but the various contrivances which have been adopted for this purpose are amongst the most interesting and most ingenious to which mechanical science has given birth working models on an enlarged scale are almost necessary to make their action understood by the unlearned reader; and unfortunately these are not often to be met with a very fine collection of such models exists amongst the collection of instruments at the university of prague instruments of this kind have been made to extend their action over considerable periods of time and to register not merely the hour of the day but the days of the week of the month of the year and also to indicate the occurrence of several astronomical phenomena repeating clocks and watches may be considered as instruments for registering time which communicate their information only when the owner requires it by pulling a string or by some similar application an apparatus has recently been applied to watches by which the hand which indicates seconds leaves a small dot of ink on the dialplate whenever a certain stop or detent is pushed in thus whilst the eye is attentively fixed on the phenomenon to be observed the finger registers on the face of the watchdial the commencement and the end of its appearance  several instruments have been contrived for awakening the attention of the observer at times previously fixed upon the various kinds of alarums connected with clocks and watches are of this kind in some instances it is desirable to be able to set them so as to give notice at many successive and distant points of time such as those of the arrival of given stars on the meridian a clock of this kind is used at the royal observatory at greenwich  an earthquake is a phenomenon of such frequent occurrence and so interesting both from its fearful devastations as well as from its connection with geological theories that it becomes important to possess an instrument which shall if possible indicate the direction of the shock as well as its intensity an observation made a few years since at odessa after an earthquake which happened during the night suggests a simple instrument by which the direction of the shock may be determined a glass vase partly filled with water stood on the table of a room in a house at odessa; and from the coldness of the glass the inner part of the vessel above the water was coated with dew several very perceptible shocks of an earthquake happened between three and four o'clock in the morning; and when the observer got up he remarked that the dew was brushed off at two opposite sides of the glass by a wave which the earthquake had caused in the water the line joining the two highest points of this wave was of course that in which the shock travelled this circumstance which was accidentally noticed by an engineer at odessa suggests the plan of keeping in countries subject to earthquakes glass vessels partly filled with treacle or some unctuous fluid so that when any lateral motion is communicated to them from the earth the adhesion of the liquid to the glass shall enable the observer after some interval of time to determine the direction of the shock in order to obtain some measure of the vertical oscillation of the earth a weight might be attached to a spiral spring or a pendulum might be sustained in a horizontal position and a sliding index be moved by either of them so that the extreme deviations should be indicated by it this however would not give even the comparative measure accurately because a difference in the velocity of the rising or falling of the earth's surface would affect the instrument notes  transactions of the society of arts p  the contrivance is due to mr hencky of high holborn in whose establishment it is in constant use  about seven or eight years since without being aware of sir david brewster's proposal i adapted a barometer as a pendulum to the works of a common eight day clock it remained in my library for several months but i have mislaid the observations which were made  memoires de l'academie des sciences de petersburgh e serie tom i p chapter  economy of the materials employed  the precision with which all operations by machinery are executed and the exact similarity of the articles thus made produce a degree of economy in the consumption of the raw material which is in some cases of great importance the earliest mode of cutting the trunk of a tree into planks was by the use of the hatchet or the adze it might perhaps be first split into three or four portions and then each portion was reduced to a uniform surface by those instruments with such means the quantity of plank produced would probably not equal the quantity of the raw material wasted by the process and if the planks were thin would certainly fall far short of it an improved tool completely reverses the case in converting a tree into thick planks the saw causes a waste of a very small fractional part; and even in reducing it to planks of only an inch in thickness does not waste more than an eighth part of the raw material when the thickness of the plank is still further reduced as is the case in cutting wood for veneering the quantity of material destroyed again begins to bear a considerable proportion to that which is used; and hence circular saws having a very thin blade have been employed for such purposes in order to economize still further the more valuable woods mr brunel contrived a machine which by a system of blades cut off the veneer in a continuous shaving thus rendering the whole of the piece of timber available  the rapid improvements which have taken place in the printing press during the last twenty years afford another instance of saving in the materials consumed which has been well ascertained by measurement and is interesting from its connection with literature in the old method of inking type by large hemispherical balls stuffed and covered with leather the printer after taking a small portion of ink from the inkblock was continually rolling the balls in various directions against each other in order that a thin layer of ink might be uniformly spread over their surface this he again transferred to the type by a kind of rolling action in such a process even admitting considerable skill in the operator it could not fail to happen that a large quantity of ink should get near the edges of the balls which not being transferred to the type became hard and useless and was taken off in the form of a thick black crust another inconvenience also arosethe quantity of ink spread on the block not being regulated by measure and the number and direction of the transits of the inkingballs over each other depending on the will of the operator and being consequently irregular it was impossible to place on the type a uniform layer of ink of the quantity exactly sufficient for the impression the introduction of cylindrical rollers of an elastic substance formed by the mixture of glue and treacle superseded the inkingballs and produced considerable saving in the consumption of ink but the most perfect economy was only to be produced by mechanism when printingpresses moved by the power of steam were introduced the action of these rollers was found to be well adapted to their performance; and a reservoir of ink was formed from which a roller regularly abstracted a small quantity at each impression from three to five other rollers spread this portion uniformly over a slab by most ingenious contrivances varied in almost each kind of press and another travelling roller having fed itself on the slab passed and repassed over the type just before it gave the impression to the paper in order to shew that this plan of inking puts the proper quantity of ink upon the type we must prove firstthat the quantity is not too little this would soon have been discovered from the complaints of the public and the booksellers; and secondly that it is not too great this latter point was satisfactorily established by an experiment a few hours after one side of a sheet of paper has been printed upon the ink is sufficiently dry to allow it to receive the impression upon the other; and as considerable pressure is made use of the tympan on which the side first printed is laid is guarded from soiling it by a sheet of paper called the setoff sheet this paper receives in succession every sheet of the work to be printed acquiring from them more or less of the ink according to their dryness or the quantity upon them it was necessary in the former process after about one hundred impressions to change this setoff sheet which then became too much soiled for further use in the new method of printing by machinery no such sheet is used but a blanket is employed as its substitute; this does not require changing above once in five thousand impressions and instances have occurred of its remaining sufficiently clean for twenty thousand here then is a proof that the quantity of superfluous ink put upon the paper in machineprinting is so small that if multiplied by five thousand and in some instances even by twenty thousand it is only sufficient to render useless a single piece of clean cloth the following were the results of an accurate experiment upon the effect of the process just described made at one of the largest printing establishments in the metropolis two hundred reams of paper were printed off the old method of inking with balls being employed; two hundred reams of the same paper and for the same book were then printed off in the presses which inked their own type the consumption of ink by the machine was to that by the balls as four to nine or rather less than onehalf notes  in the very best kind of printing it is necessary in the old method to change the setoff sheet once in twelve times in printing the same kind of work by machinery the blanket is changed once in  this experiment was made at the establishment of mr clowes in stamford street  chapter  of the identity of the work when it is of the same kind and its accuracy when of different kinds  nothing is more remarkable and yet less unexpected than the perfect identity of things manufactured by the same tool if the top of a circular box is to be made to fit over the lower part it may be done in the lathe by gradually advancing the tool of the slidingrest; the proper degree of tightness between the box and its lid being found by trial after this adjustment if a thousand boxes are made no additional care is required; the tool is always carried up to the stop and each box will be equally adapted to every lid the same identity pervades all the arts of printing; the impressions from the same block or the same copperplate have a similarity which no labour could produce by hand the minutest traces are transferred to all the impressions and no omission can arise from the inattention or unskilfulness of the operator the steel punch with which the cardwadding for a fowlingpiece is cut if it once perform its office with accuracy constantly reproduces the same exact circle  the accuracy with which machinery executes its work is perhaps one of its most important advantages it may however be contended that a considerable portion of this advantage may be resolved into saving of time; for it generally happens that any improvement in tools increases the quantity of work done in a given time without tools that is by the mere efforts of the human hand there are undoubtedly multitudes of things which it would be impossible to make add to the human hand the rudest cutting instrument and its powers are enlarged the fabrication of many things then becomes easy and that of others possible with great labour add the saw to the knife or the hatchet and other works become possible and a new course of difficult operations is brought into view whilst many of the former are rendered easy this observation is applicable even to the most perfect tools or machines it would be possible for a very skilful workman with files and polishing substances to form a cylinder out of a piece of steel; but the time which this would require would be so considerable and the number of failures would probably be so great that for all practical purposes such a mode of producing a steel cylinder might be said to be impossible the same process by the aid of the lathe and the slidingrest is the everyday employment of hundreds of workmen  of all the operations of mechanical art that of turning is the most perfect if two surfaces are worked against each other whatever may have been their figure at the commencement there exists a tendency in them both to become portions of spheres either of them may become convex and the other concave with various degrees of curvature a plane surface is the line of separation between convexity and concavity and is most difficult to hit; it is more easy to make a good circle than to produce a straight line a similar difficulty takes place in figuring specula for telescopes; the parabola is the surface which separates the hyperbolic from the elliptic figure and is the most difficult to form if a spindle not cylindrical at its end be pressed into a hole not circular and kept constantly turning there is a tendency in these two bodies so situated to become conical or to have circular sections if a triangularpointed piece of iron be worked round in a circular hole the edges will gradually wear and it will become conical these facts if they do not explain at least illustrate the principles on which the excellence of work formed in the lathe depends  chapter  of copying  the two lastmentioned sources of excellence in the work produced by machinery depend on a principle which pervades a very large portion of all manufactures and is one upon which the cheapness of the articles produced seems greatly to depend the principle alluded to is that of copying taken in its most extensive sense almost unlimited pains are in some instances bestowed on the original from which a series of copies is to be produced; and the larger the number of these copies the more care and pains can the manufacturer afford to lavish upon the original it may thus happen that the instrument or tool actually producing the work shall cost five or even ten thousand times the price of each individual specimen of its power as the system of copying is of so much importance and of such extensive use in the arts it will be convenient to classify a considerable number of those processes in which it is employed the following enumeration however is not offered as a complete list; and the explanations are restricted to the shortest possible detail which is consistent with a due regard to making the subject intelligible operations of copying are effected under the following circumstances by printing from cavities   by stamping by printing from surface  by punching by casting     with elongation by moulding    with altered dimensions  of printing from cavities  the art of printing in all its numerous departments is essentially an art of copying under its two great divisions printing from hollow lines as in copperplate and printing from surface as in block printing are comprised numerous arts  copperplate printing in this instance the copies are made by transferring to paper by means of pressure a thick ink from the hollows and lines cut in the copper an artist will sometimes exhaust the labour of one or two years upon engraving a plate which will not in some cases furnish above five hundred copies in a state of perfection  engravings on steel this art is like that of engraving on copper except that the number of copies is far less limited a banknote engraved as a copperplate will not give above three thousand impressions without a sensible deterioration two impressions of a banknote engraved on steel were examined by one of our most eminent artists who found it difficult to pronounce with any confidence which was the earliest impression one of these was a proof from amongst the first thousand the other was taken after between seventy and eighty thousand had been printed off  music printing music is usually printed from pewter plates on which the characters have been impressed by steel punches the metal being much softer than copper is liable to scratches which detain a small portion of the ink this is the reason of the dirty appearance of printed music a new process has recently been invented by mr cowper by which this inconvenience will be avoided the improved method which give sharpness to the characters is still an art of copying; but it is effected by surface printing nearly in the same manner as calicoprinting from blocks to be described hereafter the method of printing music from pewter plates although by far the most frequently made use of is not the only one employed for music is occasionally printed from stone sometimes also it is printed with moveable type; and occasionally the musical characters are printed on the paper and the lines printed afterwards specimens of both these latter modes of musicprinting may be seen in the splendid collection of impressions from the types of the press of bodoni at parma but notwithstanding the great care bestowed on the execution of that work the perpetual interruption of continuity in the lines arising from the use of moveable types when the characters and lines are printed at the same time is apparent  calico printing from cylinders many of the patterns on printed calicos are copies by printing from copper cylinders about four or five inches in diameter on which the desired pattern has been previously engraved one portion of the cylinders is exposed to the ink whilst an elastic scraper of very thin steel by being pressed forcibly against another part removes all superfluous ink from the surface previously to its reaching the cloth a piece of calico twentyeight yards in length rolls through this press and is printed in four or five minutes  printing from perforated sheets of metal or stencilling very thin brass is sometimes perforated in the form of letters usually those of a name; this is placed on any substance which it is required to mark and a brush dipped in some paint is passed over the brass those parts which are cut away admit the paint and thus a copy of the name appears on the substance below this method which affords rather a coarse copy is sometimes used for paper with which rooms are covered and more especially for the borders if a portion be required to match an old pattern this is perhaps the most economical way of producing it  coloured impressions of leaves upon paper may be made by a kind of surface printing such leaves are chosen as have considerable inequalities the elevated parts of these are covered by means of an inking ball with a mixture of some pigment ground up in linseed oil; the leaf is then placed between two sheets of paper and being gently pressed the impression from the elevated parts on each side appear on the corresponding sheets of paper  the beautiful red cotton handkerchiefs dyed at glasgow have their pattern given to them by a process similar to stencilling except that instead of printing from a pattern the reverse operation that of discharging a part of the colour from a cloth already dyedis performed a number of handkerchiefs are pressed with very great force between two plates of metal which are similarly perforated with round or lozengeshaped holes according to the intended pattern the upper plate of metal is surrounded by a rim and a fluid which has the property of discharging the red dye is poured upon that plate this liquid passes through the holes in the metal and also through the calico; but owing to the great pressure opposite all the parts of the plates not cut away it does not spread itself beyond the pattern after this the handkerchiefs are washed and the pattern of each is a copy of the perforations in the metalplate used in the process another mode by which a pattern is formed by discharging colour from a previously dyed cloth is to print on it a pattern with paste; then passing it into the dyingvat it comes out dyed of one uniform colour but the paste has protected the fibres of the cotton from the action of the dye or mordant; and when the cloth so dyed is well washed the paste is dissolved and leaves uncoloured all those parts of the cloth to which it was applied  printing from surface  this second department of printing is of more frequent application in the arts than that which has just been considered  printing from wooden blocks a block of box wood is in this instance the substance out of which the pattern is formed the design being sketched upon it the workman cuts away with sharp tools every part except the lines to be represented in the impression this is exactly the reverse of the process of engraving on copper in which every line to be represented is cut away the ink instead of filling the cavities cut in the wood is spread upon the surface which remains and is thence transferred to the paper  printing from moveable types this is the most important in its influence of all the arts of copying it possesses a singular peculiarity in the immense subdivision of the parts that form the pattern after that pattern has furnished thousands of copies the same individual elements may be arranged again and again in other forms and thus supply multitudes of originals from each of which thousands of their copied impressions may flow it also possesses this advantage that woodcuts may be used along with the letterpress and impressions taken from both at the same operation  printing from stereotype this mode of producing copies is very similar to the preceding there are two modes by which stereotype plates are produced in that most generally adopted a mould is taken in plaster from the moveable types and in this the stereotype plate is cast another method has been employed in france instead of composing the work in moveable type it was set up in moveable copper matrices; each matrix being in fact a piece of copper of the same size as the type and having the impression of the letter sunk into its surface instead of projecting in relief a stereotype plate may it is evident be obtained at once from this arrangement of matrices the objection to the plan is the great expense of keeping so large a collection of matrices as the original composition does not readily admit of change stereotype plates can only be applied with advantage to cases where an extraordinary number of copies are demanded or where the work consists of figures and it is of great importance to ensure accuracy trifling alterations may however be made in it from time to time; and thus mathematical tables may by the gradual extirpation of error at last become perfect this mode of producing copies possesses in common with that by moveable types the advantage of admitting the use of woodcuts the copy of the woodcut in the stereotype plate being equally perfect with that of the moveable type this union is of considerable importance and cannot be accomplished with engravings on copper  lettering books the gilt letters on the backs of books are formed by placing a piece of gold leaf upon the leather and pressing upon it brass letters previously heated these cause the gold immediately under them to adhere to the leather whilst the rest of the metal is easily brushed away when a great number of copies of the same volume are to be lettered it is found to be cheaper to have a brass pattern cut with the whole of the proper title this is placed in a press and being kept hot the covers each having a small bit of leafgold placed in the proper position are successively brought under the brass and stamped the lettering at the back of the volume in the reader's hand was executed in this manner  calico printing from blocks this is a mode of copying by surface printing from the ends of small pieces of copper wire of various forms fixed into a block of wood they are all of one uniform height about the eighth part of an inch above the surface of the wood and are arranged by the maker into any required pattern if the block be placed upon a piece of fine woollen cloth on which ink of any colour has been uniformly spread the projecting copper wires receive a portion which they give up when applied to the calico to be printed by the former method of printing on calico only one colour could be used; but by this plan after the flower of a rose for example has been printed with one set of blocks the leaves may be printed of another colour by a different set  printing oilcloth after the canvas which forms the basis of oilcloth has been covered with paint of one uniform tint the remainder of the processes which it passes through are a series of copyings by surface printing from patterns formed upon wooden blocks very similar to those employed by the calico printer each colour requiring a distinct set of blocks those oilcloths with the greatest variety of colours are most expensive there are several other varieties of printing which we shall briefly notice as arts of copying; which although not strictly surface printing yet are more allied to it than that from copperplates  letter copying in one of the modes of performing this process a sheet of very thin paper is damped and placed upon the writing to be copied the two papers are then passed through a rolling press and a portion of the ink from one paper is transferred to the other the writing is of course reversed by this process; but the paper to which it is transferred being thin the characters are seen through it on the other side in their proper position another common mode of copying letters is by placing a sheet of paper covered on both sides with a substance prepared from lampblack between a sheet of thin paper and the paper on which the letter to be despatched is to be written if the upper or thin sheet be written upon with any hard pointed substance the word written with this style will be impressed from the black paper upon both those adjoining it the translucency of the upper sheet which is retained by the writer is in this instance necessary to render legible the writing which is on the back of the paper both these arts are very limited in their extent the former affording two or three the latter from two to perhaps ten or fifteen copies at the same time  printing on china this is an art of copying which is carried to a very great extent as the surfaces to which the impression is to be conveyed are often curved and sometimes even fluted the ink or paint is first transferred from the copper to some flexible substance such as paper or an elastic compound of glue and treacle it is almost immediately conveyed from this to the unbaked biscuit to which it more readily adheres  lithographic printing this is another mode of producing copies in almost unlimited number the original which supplies the copies is a drawing made on a stone of a slightly porous nature the ink employed for tracing it is made of such greasy materials that when water is poured over the stone it shall not wet the lines of the drawing when a roller covered with printing ink which is of an oily nature is passed over the stone previously wetted the water prevents this ink from adhering to the uncovered portions; whilst the ink used in the drawing is of such a nature that the printing ink adheres to it in this state if a sheet of paper be placed upon the stone and then passed under a press the printing ink will be transferred to the paper leaving the ink used in the drawing still adhering to the stone  there is one application of lithographic printing which does not appear to have received sufficient attention and perhaps further experiments are necessary to bring it to perfection it is the reprinting of works which have just arrived from other countries a few years ago one of the paris newspapers was reprinted at brussels as soon as it arrived by means of lithography whilst the ink is yet fresh this may easily be accomplished it is only necessary to place one copy of the newspaper on a lithographic stone; and by means of great pressure applied to it in a rolling press a sufficient quantity of the printing ink will be transferred to the stone by similar means the other side of the newspaper may be copied on another stone and these stones will then furnish impressions in the usual way if printing from stone could be reduced to the same price per thousand as that from moveable types this process might be adopted with great advantage for the supply of works for the use of distant countries possessing the same language for a single copy might be printed off with transfer ink and thus an english work for example might be published in america from stone whilst the original printed from moveable types made its appearance on the same day in england  it is much to be wished that such a method were applicable to the reprinting of facsimiles of old and scarce books this however would require the sacrifice of two copies since a leaf must be destroyed for each page such a method of reproducing a small impression of an old work is peculiarly applicable to mathematical tables the setting up of which in type is always expensive and liable to error but how long ink will continue to be transferable to stone from paper on which it has been printed must be determined by experiment the destruction of the greasy or oily portion of the ink in the character of old books seems to present the greatest impediment; if one constituent only of the ink were removed by time it might perhaps be hoped that chemical means would ultimately be discovered for restoring it but if this be unsuccessful an attempt might be made to discover some substance having a strong affinity for the carbon of the ink which remains on the paper and very little for the paper itself  lithographic prints have occasionally been executed in colours in such instances a separate stone seems to have been required for each colour and considerable care or very good mechanism must have been employed to adjust the paper to each stone if any two kinds of ink should be discovered mutually inadhesive one stone might be employed for two inks; or if the inkingroller for the second and subsequent colours had portions cut away corresponding to those parts of the stone inked by the previous ones then several colours might be printed from the same stone but these principles do not appear to promise much except for coarse subjects  register printing it is sometimes thought necessary to print from a wooden block or stereotype plate the same pattern reversed upon the opposite side of the paper the effect of this which is technically called register printing is to make it appear as if the ink had penetrated through the paper and rendered the pattern visible on the other side if the subject chosen contains many fine lines it seems at first sight extremely difficult to effect so exact a super position of the two patterns on opposite sides of the same piece of paper that it shall be impossible to detect the slightest deviation; yet the process is extremely simple the block which gives the impression is always accurately brought down to the same place by means of a hinge; this spot is covered by a piece of thin leather stretched over it; the block is now inked and being brought down to its place gives an impression of the pattern to the leather it is then turned back; and being inked a second time the paper intended to be printed is placed upon the leather when the block again descending the upper surface of the paper is printed from the block and its undersurface takes up the impression from the leather it is evident that the perfection of this mode of printing depends in a great measure on finding some soft substance like leather which will take as much ink as it ought from the block and which will give it up most completely to paper impressions thus obtained are usually fainter on the lower side; and in order in some measure to remedy this defect rather more ink is put on the block at the first than at the second impression  of copying by casting  the art of casting by pouring substances in a fluid state into a mould which retains them until they become solid is essentially an art of copying; the form of the thing produced depending entirely upon that of the pattern from which it was formed  of casting iron and other metalspatterns of wood or metal made from drawings are the originals from which the moulds for casting are made so that in fact the casting itself is a copy of the mould; and the mould is a copy of the pattern in castings of iron and metals for the coarser purposes and if they are afterwards to be worked even for the finer machines the exact resemblance amongst the things produced which takes place in many of the arts to which we have alluded is not effected in the first instance nor is this necessary as the metals shrink in cooling the pattern is made larger than the intended copy; and in extricating it from the sand in which it is moulded some little difference will occur in the size of the cavity which it leaves in smaller works where accuracy is more requisite and where few or no after operations are to be performed a mould of metal is employed which has been formed with considerable care thus in casting bullets which ought to be perfectly spherical and smooth an iron instrument is used in which a cavity has been cut and carefully ground; and in order to obviate the contraction in cooling a jet is left which may supply the deficiency of metal arising from that cause and which is afterwards cut off the leaden toys for children are cast in brass moulds which open and in which have been graved or chiselled the figures intended to be produced  a very beautiful mode of representing small branches of the most delicate vegetable productions in bronze has been employed by mr chantrey a small strip of a firtree a branch of holly a curled leaf of broccoli or any other vegetable production is suspended by one end in a small cylinder of paper which is placed for support within a similarly formed tin case the finest river silt carefully separated from all the coarser particles and mixed with water so as to have the consistency of cream is poured into the paper cylinder by small portions at a time carefully shaking the plant a little after each addition in order that its leaves may be covered and that no bubbles of air may be left the plant and its mould are now allowed to dry and the yielding nature of the paper allows the loamy coating to shrink from the outside when this is dry it is surrounded by a coarser substance; and finally we have the twig with all its leaves embedded in a perfect mould this mould is carefully dried and then gradually heated to a red heat at the ends of some of the leaves or shoots wires have been left to afford airholes by their removal and in this state of strong ignition a stream of air is directed into the hole formed by the end of the branch the consequence is that the wood and leaves which had been turned into charcoal by the fire are now converted into carbonic acid by the current of air; and after some time the whole of the solid matter of which the plant consisted is completely removed leaving a hollow mould bearing on its interior all the minutest traces of its late vegetable occupant when this process is completed the mould being still kept at nearly a red heat receives the fluid metal which by its weight either drives the very small quantity of air which at that high temperature remains behind out through the airholes or compresses it into the pores of very porous substance of which the mould is formed  when the form of the object intended to be cast is such that the pattern cannot be extricated from its mould of sand or plaster it becomes necessary to make the pattern with wax or some other easily fusible substance the sand or plaster is moulded round this pattern and by the application of heat the wax is extricated through an opening left purposely for its escape  it is often desirable to ascertain the form of the internal cavities inhabited by molluscous animals such as those of spiral shells and of the various corals this may be accomplished by filling them with fusible metal and dissolving the substance of the shell by muriatic acid; thus a metallic solid will remain which exactly filled all the cavities if such forms are required in silver or any other difficulty fusible metal the shells may be filled with wax or resin then dissolved away; and the remaining waxen form may serve as the pattern from which a plaster mould may be made for casting the metal some nicety will be required in these operations; and perhaps the minuter cavities can only be filled under an exhausted receiver  casting in plaster this is a mode of copying applied to a variety of purposes to produce accurate representations of the human formof statuesor of rare fossilsto which latter purpose it has lately been applied with great advantage in all casting the first process is to make the mould; and plaster is the substance which is almost always employed for the purpose the property which it possesses of remaining for a short time in a state of fluidity renders it admirably adapted to this object and adhesion even to an original of plaster is effectually prevented by oiling the surface on which it is poured the mould formed round the subject which is copied removed in separate pieces and then reunited is that in which the copy is cast this process gives additional utility and value to the finest works of art the students of the academy at venice are thus enabled to admire the sculptured figures of egina preserved in the gallery at munich; as well as the marbles of the parthenon the pride of our own museum casts in plaster of the elgin marbles adorn many of the academies of the continent; and the liberal employment of such presents affords us an inexpensive and permanent source of popularity  casting in wax this mode of copying aided by proper colouring offers the most successful imitations of many objects of natural history and gives an air of reality to them which might deceive even the most instructed numerous figures of remarkable persons having the face and hands formed in wax have been exhibited at various times; and the resemblances have in some instances been most striking but whoever would see the art of copying in wax carried to the highest perfection should examine the beautiful collection of fruit at the house of the horticultural society; the model of the magnificent flower of the new genus rafflesiathe waxen models of the internal parts of the human body which adorn the anatomical gallery of the jardin des plantes at paris and the museum at florenceor the collection of morbid anatomy at the university of bologna the art of imitation by wax does not usually afford the multitude of copies which flow from many similar operations this number is checked by the subsequent stages of the process which ceasing to have the character of copying by a tool or pattern become consequently more expensive in each individual production form alone is given by casting; the colouring must be the work of the pencil guided by the skill of the artist  of copying by moulding  this method of producing multitudes of individuals having an exact resemblance to each other in external shape is adopted very widely in the arts the substances employed are either naturally or by artificial preparation in a soft or plastic state; they are then compressed by mechanical force sometimes assisted by heat into a mould of the required form  of bricks and tiles an oblong box of wood fitting upon a bottom fixed to the brickmaker's bench is the mould from which every brick is formed a portion of the plastic mixture of which the bricks consist is made ready by less skilful hands the workman first sprinkles a little sand into the mould and then throws the clay into it with some force; at the same time rapidly working it with his fingers so as to make it completely close up to the corners he next scrapes off with a wetted stick the superfluous clay and shakes the newformed brick dexterously out of its mould upon a piece of board on which it is removed by another workman to the place appointed for drying it a very skilful moulder has occasionally in a long summer's day delivered from ten to eleven thousand bricks; but a fair average day's work is from five to six thousand tiles of various kinds and forms are made of finer materials but by the same system of moulding among the ruins of the city of gour the ancient capital of bengal bricks are found having projecting ornaments in high relief these appear to have been formed in a mould and subsequently glazed with a coloured glaze in germany also brickwork has been executed with various ornaments the cornice of the church of st stephano at berlin is made of large blocks of brick moulded into the form required by the architect at the establishment of messrs cubitt in gray's inn lane vases cornices and highly ornamented capitals of columns are thus formed which rival stone itself in elasticity hardness and durability  of embossed china many of the forms given to those beautiful specimens of earthenware which constitute the equipage of our breakfast and our dinnertables cannot be executed in the lathe of the potter the embossed ornaments on the edges of the plates their polygonal shape the fluted surface of many of the vases would all be difficult and costly of execution by the hand; but they become easy and comparatively cheap when made by pressing the soft material out of which they are formed into a hard mould the care and skill bestowed on the preparation of that mould are repaid by the multitude it produces in many of the works of the china manufactory one part only of the article is moulded; the upper surface of the plate for example whilst the under side is figured by the lathe in some instances the handle or only a few ornaments are moulded and the body of the work is turned  glass seals the process of engraving upon gems requires considerable time and skill the seals thus produced can therefore never become common imitations however have been made of various degrees of resemblance the colour which is given to glass is perhaps the most successful part of the imitation a small cylindrical rod of coloured glass is heated in the flame of a blowpipe until the extremity becomes soft the operator then pinches it between the ends of a pair of nippers which are formed of brass and on one side of which the device intended for the seal has been carved in relief when the mould has been well finished and care is taken in heating the glass properly the seals thus produced are not bad imitations; and by this system of copying they are so multiplied that the more ordinary kinds are sold at birmingham for three pence a dozen  square glass bottles the round forms which are usually given to vessels of glass are readily produced by the expansion of the air with which they are blown it is however necessary in many cases to make bottles of a square form and each capable of holding exactly the same quantity of fluid it is also frequently desirable to have imprinted on them the name of the maker of the medicine or other liquid they are destined to contain a mould of iron or of copper is provided of the intended size on the inside of which are engraved the names required this mould which is used in a hot state opens into two parts to allow the insertion of the round unfinished bottle which is placed in it in a very soft state before it is removed from the end of the iron tube with which it was blown the mould is now closed and the glass is forced against its sides by blowing strongly into the bottle  wooden snuff boxes snuff boxes ornamented with devices in imitation of carved work or of rose engine turning are sold at a price which proves that they are only imitations the wood or horn out of which they are formed is softened by long boiling in water and whilst in this state it is forced into moulds of iron or steel on which are cut the requisite patterns where it remains exposed to great pressure until it is dry  horn knife handles and umbrella handles the property which horn possesses of becoming soft by the action of water and of heat fits it for many useful purposes it is pressed into moulds and becomes embossed with figures in relief adapted to the objects to which it is to be applied if curved it may be straightened; or if straight it may be bent into any forms which ornament or utility may require; and by the use of the mould these forms may be multiplied in endless variety the commoner sorts of knives the crooked handles for umbrellas and a multitude of other articles to which horn is applied attest the cheapness which the art of copying gives to the things formed of this material  moulding tortoiseshell the same principle is applied to things formed out of the shell of the turtle or the land tortoise from the greatly superior price of the raw material this principle of copying is however more rarely employed upon it; and the few carvings which are demanded are usually performed by hand  tobaccopipe making this simple art is almost entirely one of copying the moulds are formed of iron in two parts each embracing one half of the stem; the line of junction of these parts may generally be observed running lengthwise from one end of the pipe to the other the hole passing to the bowl is formed by thrusting a long wire through the clay before it is enclosed in the mould some of the moulds have figures or names sunk in the inside which give a corresponding figure in relief upon the finished pipe  embossing upon calico calicoes of one colour but embossed all over with raised patterns though not much worn in this country are in great demand in several foreign markets this appearance is produced by passing them between rollers on one of which is figured in intaglio the pattern to be transferred to the calico the substance of the cloth is pressed very forcibly into the cavities thus formed and retains its pattern after considerable use the watered appearance in the cover of the volume in the reader's hands is produced in a similar manner a cylinder of gunmetal on which the design of the watering is previously cut is pressed by screws against another cylinder formed out of pieces of brown paper which have been strongly compressed together and accurately turned the two cylinders are made to revolve rapidly the paper one being slightly damped and after a few minutes it takes an impression from the upper or metal one the glazed calico is now passed between the rollers its glossy surface being in contact with the metal cylinder which is kept hot by a heated iron enclosed within it calicoes are sometimes watered by placing two pieces on each other in such a position that the longitudinal threads of the one are at right angles to those of the other and compressing them in this state between flat rollers the threads of the one piece produce indentations in those of the other but they are not so deep as when produced by the former method  embossing upon leather this art of copying from patterns previously engraved on steel rollers is in most respects similar to the preceding the leather is forced into the cavities and the parts which are not opposite to any cavity are powerfully condensed between the rollers  swaging this is an art of copying practised by the smith in order to fashion his iron and steel into the various forms demanded by his customers he has small blocks of steel into which are sunk cavities of different shapes; these are called swages and are generally in pairs thus if he wants a round bolt terminating in a cylindrical head of larger diameter and having one or more projecting rims he uses a corresponding swaging tool; and having heated the end of his iron rod and thickened it by striking the end in the direction of the axis which is technically called upsetting he places its head upon one part of the lage; and whilst an assistant holds the other part on the top of the hot iron he strikes it several times with his hammer occasionally turning the head one quarter round the heated iron is thus forced by the blows to assume the form of the mould into which it is impressed  engraving by pressure this is one of the most beautiful examples of the art of copying carried to an almost unlimited extent; and the delicacy with which it can be executed and the precision with which the finest traces of the graving tool can be transferred from steel to copper or even from hard steel to soft steel is most unexpected we are indebted to mr perkins for most of the contrivances which have brought this art at once almost to perfection an engraving is first made upon soft steel which is hardened by a peculiar process without in the least injuring its delicacy a cylinder of soft steel pressed with great force against the hardened steel engraving is now made to roll very slowly backward and forward over it thus receiving the design but in relief the cylinder is in its turn hardened without injury and if it be slowly rolled to and fro with strong pressure on successive plates of copper it will imprint on a thousand of them a perfect facsimile of the original steel engraving from which it was made thus the number of copies producible from the same design may be multiplied a thousandfold but even this is very far short of the limits to which the process may be extended the hardened steel roller bearing the design upon it in relief may be employed to make a few of its first impressions upon plates of soft steel and these being hardened become the representatives of the original engraving and may in their turn be made the parents of other rollers each generating copperplates like their prototype the possible extent to which facsimiles of one original engraving may thus be multiplied almost confounds the imagination and appears to be for all practical purposes unlimited this beautiful art was first proposed by mr perkins for the purpose of rendering the forgery of bank notes a matter of great difficulty; and there are two principles which peculiarly adapt it to that object first the perfect identity of all the impressions so that any variation in the minutest line would at once cause detection; secondly that the original plates may be formed by the united labours of several artists most eminent in their respective departments; for as only one original of each design is necessary the expense even of the most elaborate engraving will be trifling compared with the multitude of copies produced from it  it must however be admitted that the principle of copying itself furnishes an expedient for imitating any engraving or printed pattern however complicated; and thus presents a difficulty which none of the schemes devised for the prevention of forgery appear to have yet effectually obviated in attempting to imitate the most perfect banknote the first process would be to place it with the printed side downwards upon a stone or other substance on which by passing it through a rollingpress it might be firmly fixed the next object would be to discover some solvent which should dissolve the paper but neither affect the printingink nor injure the stone or substance to which it is attached water does not seem to do this effectually and perhaps weak alkaline or acid solutions would be tried if however this could be fully accomplished and if the stone or other substance used to retain the impression had those properties which enable us to print from it innumerable facsimiles of the note might obviously be made and the imitation would be complete porcelain biscuit which has recently been used with a black lead pencil for memorandum books seems in some measure adapted for such trials since its porosity may be diminished to any required extent by regulating the dilution of the glazing  gold and silver moulding many of the mouldings used by jewellers consist of thin slips of metal which have received their form by passing between steel rollers on which the pattern is embossed or engraved; thus taking a succession of copies of the devices intended  ornamental papers sheets of paper coloured or covered with gold or silver leaf and embossed with various patterns are used for covering books and for many ornamental purposes the figures upon these are produced by the same process that of passing the sheets of paper between engraved rollers  of copying by stamping  this mode of copying is extensively employed in the arts it is generally executed by means of large presses worked with a screw and heavy flywheel the materials on which the copies are impressed are most frequently metals and the process is sometimes executed when they are hot and in one case when the metal is in a state between solidity and fluidity  coins and medals the whole of the coins which circulate as money are produced by this mode of copying the screw presses are either worked by manual labour by water or by steam power the mint which was sent a few years since to calcutta was capable of coining pieces a day medals which usually have their figures in higher relief than coins are produced by similar means; but a single blow is rarely sufficient to bring them to perfection and the compression of the metal which arises from the first blow renders it too hard to receive many subsequent blows without injury to the die it is therefore after being struck removed to a furnace in which it is carefully heated redhot and annealed after which operation it is again placed between the dies and receives additional blows for medals on which the figures are very prominent these processes must be repeated many times one of the largest medals hitherto struck underwent them nearly a hundred times before it was completed  ornaments for military accoutrements and furniture these are usually of brass and are stamped up out of solid or sheet brass by placing it between dies and allowing a heavy weight to drop upon the upper die from a height of from five to fifteen feet  buttons and nail heads buttons embossed with crests or other devices are produced by the same means; and some of those which are plain receive their hemispherical form from the dies in which they are struck the heads of several kinds of nails which are portions of spheres or polyhedrons are also formed by these means  of a process for copying called in france clichee this curious method of copying by stamping is applied to medals and in some cases to forming stereotype plates there exists a range of temperature previous to the melting point of several of the alloys of lead tin and antimony in which the compound is neither solid nor yet fluid in this kind of pasty state it is placed in a box under a die which descends upon it with considerable force the blow drives the metal into the finest lines of the die and the coldness of the latter immediately solidifies the whole mass a quantity of the halfmelted metal is scattered in all directions by the blow and is retained by the sides of the box in which the process is carried on the work thus produced is admirable for its sharpness but has not the finished form of a piece just leaving the coiningpress the sides are ragged and it must be trimmed and its thickness equalized in the lathe  of copying by punching  this mode of copying consists in driving a steel punch through the substance to be cut either by a blow or by pressure in some cases the object is to copy the aperture and the substance separated from the plate is rejected; in other cases the small pieces cut out are the objects of the workman's labour  punching iron plate for boilers the steel punch used for this purpose is from threeeighths to threequarters of an inch in diameter and drives out a circular disk from a plate of iron from onequarter to five eighths of an inch thick  punching tinned iron the ornamental patterns of open work which decorate the tinned and japanned wares in general use are rarely punched by the workman who makes them in london the art of punching out these patterns in screwpresses is carried on as a separate trade; and large quantities of sheet tin are thus perforated for cullenders winestrainers borders of waiters and other similar purposes the perfection and the precision to which the art has been carried are remarkable sheets of copper too are punched with small holes about the hundredth of an inch in diameter in such multitudes that more of the sheet metal is removed than remains behind; and plates of tin have been perforated with above three thousand holes in each square inch  the inlaid plates of brass and rosewood called buhl work which ornament our furniture are in some instances formed by punching; but in this case both the parts cut out and those which remain are in many cases employed in the remaining illustrations of the art of copying by punching the part made use of is that which is punched out  cards for guns the substitution of a circular disk of thin card instead of paper for retaining in its place the charge of a fowlingpiece is attended with considerable advantage it would however be of little avail unless an easy method was contrived of producing an unlimited number of cards each exactly fitting the bore of the barrel the small steel tool used for this purpose cuts out innumerable circles similar to its cutting end each of which precisely fills the barrel for which it was designed  ornaments of gilt paper the golden stars leaves and other devices sold in shops for the purpose of ornamenting articles made of paper and pasteboard and other fancy works are cut by punches of various forms out of sheets of gilt paper  steel chains the chain used in connecting the mainspring and fusee in watches and clocks is composed of small pieces of sheet steel and it is of great importance that each of these pieces should be of exactly the same size the links are of two sorts; one of them consisting of a single oblong piece of steel with two holes in it and the other formed by connecting two of the same pieces of steel placed parallel to each other and at a small distance apart by two rivets the two kinds of links occur alternately in the chain each end of the single pieces being placed between the ends of two others and connected with them by a rivet passing through all three if the rivet holes in the pieces for the double links are not precisely at equal distances the chain will not be straight and will consequently be unfit for its purpose  copying with elongation  in this species of copying there exists but little resemblance between the copy and the original it is the crosssection only of the thing produced which is similar to the tool through which it passes when the substances to be operated upon are hard they must frequently pass in succession through several holes and it is in some cases necessary to anneal them at intervals  wire drawing the metal to be converted into wire is made of a cylindrical form and drawn forcibly through circular holes in plates of steel at each passage it becomes smaller and when finished its section at any point is a precise copy of the last hole through which it passed upon the larger kinds of wire fine lines may sometimes be traced running longitudinally these arise from slight imperfections in the holes of the drawplates for many purposes of the arts wire the section of which is square or half round is required the same method of making it is pursued except that the holes through which it is drawn are in such cases themselves square or halfround or of whatever other form the wire is required to be a species of wire is made the section of which resembles a star with from six to twelve rays; this is called pinion wire and is used by the clockmakers they file away all the rays from a short piece except from about half an inch near one end this becomes a pinion for a clock; and the leaves or teeth are already burnished and finished from having passed through the drawplate  tube drawing the art of forming tubes of uniform diameter is nearly similar in its mode of execution to wire drawing the sheet brass is bent round and soldered so as to form a hollow cylinder; and if the diameter outside is that which is required to be uniform it is drawn through a succession of holes as in wire drawing if the inside diameter is to be uniform a succession of steel cylinders called triblets are drawn through the brass tube in making tubes for telescopes it is necessary that both the inside and outside should be uniform a steel triblet therefore is first passed into the tube which is then drawn through a succession of holes until the outside diameter is reduced to the required size the metal of which the tube is formed is condensed between these holes and the steel cylinder within; and when the latter is withdrawn the internal surface appears polished the brass tube is considerably extended by this process sometimes even to double its first length  leaden pipes leaden pipes for the conveyance of water were formerly made by casting; but it has been found that they can be made both cheaper and better by drawing them through holes in the manner last described a cylinder of lead of five or six inches in diameter and about two feet long is cast with a small hole through its axis and an iron triblet of about fifteen feet in length is forced into the hole it is then drawn through a series of holes until the lead is extended upon the triblet from one end to the other and is of the proper thickness in proportion to the size of the pipe  iron rolling when cylinders of iron of greater thickness than wire are required they are formed by passing wrought iron between rollers each of which has sunk in it a semicylindrical groove; and as such rollers rarely touch accurately a longitudinal line will usually be observed in the cylinders so manufactured bar iron is thus shaped into all the various forms of round square halfround oval etc in which it occurs in commerce a particular species of moulding is thus made which resembles in its section that part of the frame of a window which separates two adjacent panes of glass being much stronger than wood it can be considerably reduced in thickness and consequently offers less obstruction to the light; it is much used for skylights  it is sometimes required that the iron thus produced should not be of uniform thickness throughout this is the case in bars for railroads where greater depth is required towards the middle of the rail which is at the greatest distance from the supports this form is produced by cutting the groove in the rollers deeper at those parts where additional strength is required so that the hollow which surrounds the roller would if it could be unwound be a mould of the shape the iron is intended to fit  vermicelli the various forms into which this paste is made are given by forcing it through holes in tin plate it passes through them and appears on the other side in long strings the cook makes use of the same method in preparing butter and ornamental pastry for the table and the confectioner in forming cylindrical lozenges of various composition  of copying with altered dimensions  of the pentagraph this mode of copying is chiefly used for drawings or maps the instrument is simple; and although usually employed in reducing is capable of enlarging the size of the copy an automaton figure exhibited in london a short time since which drew profiles of its visitors was regulated by a mechanism on this principle a small aperture in the wall opposite the seat in which the person is placed whose profile is taken conceals a camera lucida which is placed in an adjoining apartment and an assistant by moving a point connected by a pentagraph with the hand of the automaton over the outline of the head causes the figure to trace a corresponding profile  by turning the art of turning might perhaps itself be classed amongst the arts of copying a steel axis called a mandril having a pulley attached to the middle of it is supported at one end either by a conical point or by a cylindrical collar and at the other end by another collar through which it passes the extremity which projects beyond this last collar is formed into a screw by which various instruments called chucks can be attached to it these chucks are intended to hold the various materials to be submitted to the operation of turning and have a great variety of forms the mandril with the chuck is made to revolve by a strap which passes over the pulley that is attached to it and likewise over a larger wheel moved either by the foot or by its connection with steam or water power all work which is executed on a mandril partakes in some measure of the irregularities in the form of that mandril; and the perfect circularity of section which ought to exist in every part of the work can only be ensured by an equal accuracy in the mandril and its collar  rose engine turning this elegant art depends in a great measure on copying circular plates of metal called rosettes having various indentations on the surfaces and edges are fixed on the mandril which admits of a movement either endwise or laterally a fixed obstacle called the 'touch' against which the rosettes are pressed by a spring obliges the mandril to follow their indentations and thus causes the cutting tool to trace out the same pattern on the work the distance of the cutting tool from the centre being usually less than the radius of the rosette causes the copy to be much diminished  copying dies a lathe has been long known in france and recently been used at the english mint for copying dies a blunt point is carried by a very slow spiral movement successively over every part of the die to be copied and is pressed by a weight into all the cavities; while a cutting point connected with it by the machine traverses the face of a piece of soft steel in which it cuts the device of the original die on the same or on a diminished scale the degree of excellence of the copy increases in proportion as it is smaller than the original the die of a crownpiece will furnish by copy a very tolerable die for a sixpence but the chief use to be expected from this lathe is to prepare all the coarser parts and leave only the finer and more expressive lines for the skill and genius of the artist  shoelast making engine an instrument not very unlike in principle was proposed for the purpose of making shoe lasts a pattern last of a shoe for the right foot was placed in one part of the apparatus and when the machine was moved two pieces of wood placed in another part which had been previously adjusted by screws were cut into lasts greater or less than the original as was desired; and although the pattern was for the right foot one of the lasts was for the left an effect which was produced by merely interposing a wheel which reversed the motion between the two pieces of wood to be cut into lasts  engine for copying busts many years since the late mr watt amused himself with constructing an engine to produce copies of busts or statues either of the same size as the original or in a diminished proportion the substances on which he operated were various and some of the results were shewn to his friends but the mechanism by which they were made has never been described more recently mr hawkins who nearly at the same time had also contrived a similar machine has placed it in the hands of an artist who has made copies in ivory from a variety of busts the art of multiplying in different sizes the figures of the sculptor aided by that of rendering their acquisition cheap through the art of casting promises to give additional value to his productions and to diffuse more widely the pleasure arising from their possession  screw cutting when this operation is performed in the lathe by means of a screw upon the mandril it is essentially an art of copying but it is only the number of threads in a given length which is copied; the form of the thread and length as well as the diameter of the screw to be cut are entirely independent of those from which the copy is made there is another method of cutting screws in a lathe by means of one pattern screw which being connected by wheels with the mandril guides the cutting point in this process unless the time of revolution of the mandril is the same as that of the screw which guides the cutting point the number of threads in a given length will be different if the mandril move quicker than the cutting point the screw which is produced will be finer than the original; if it move slower the copy will be more coarse than the original the screw thus generated may be finer or coarser it may be larger or smaller in diameterit may have the same or a greater number of threads than that from which it is copied; yet all the defects which exist in the original will be accurately transmitted under the modified circumstances to every individual generated from it  printing from copper plates with altered dimensions some very singular specimens of an art of copying not yet made public were brought from paris a few years since a watchmaker in that city of the name of gonord had contrived a method by which he could take from the same copperplate impressions of different sizes either larger or smaller than the original design having procured four impressions of a parrot surrounded by a circle executed in this manner i shewed them to the late mr lowry an engraver equally distinguished for his skill and for the many mechanical contrivances with which he enriched his art the relative dimensions of the several impressions were so that the largest was nearly three times the linear size of the smallest; and mr lowry assured me that he was unable to detect any lines in one which had not corresponding lines in the others there appeared to be a difference in the quantity of ink but none in the traces of the engraving; and from the general appearance it was conjectured that the largest but one was the original impression from the copperplate the means by which this singular operation was executed have not been published; but two conjectures were formed at the time which merit notice it was supposed that the artist was in possession of some method of transferring the ink from the lines of a copperplate to the surface of some fluid and of retransferring the impression from the fluid to paper if this could be accomplished the print would in the first instance be of exactly the same size as the copper from which it was derived; but if the fluid were contained in a vessel having the form of an inverted cone with a small aperture at the bottom the liquid might be lowered or raised in the vessel by gradual abstraction or addition through the apex of the cone; in this case the surface to which the printingink adhered would diminish or enlarge and in this altered state the impression might be retransferred to paper it must be admitted that this conjectural explanation is liable to very considerable difficulties; for although the converse operation of taking an impression from a liquid surface has a parallel in the art of marbling paper the possibility of transferring the ink from the copper to the fluid requires to be proved another and more plausible explanation is founded on the elastic nature of the compound of glue and treacle a substance already in use in transferring engravings to earthenware it is conjectured that an impression from the copperplate is taken upon a large sheet of this composition; that this sheet is then stretched in both directions and that the ink thus expanded is transferred to paper if the copy is required to be smaller than the original the elastic substance must first be stretched and then receive the impression from the copperplate on removing the tension it will contract and thus reduce the size of the design it is possible that one transfer may not in all cases suffice; as the extensibility of the composition of glue and treacle although considerable is still limited perhaps sheets of india rubber of uniform texture and thickness may be found to answer better than this composition; or possibly the ink might be transferred from the copper plate to the surface of a bottle of this gum which bottle might after being expanded by forcing air into it give up the enlarged impression to paper as it would require considerable time to produce impressions in this manner and there might arise some difficulty in making them all of precisely the same size the process might be rendered more certain and expeditious by performing that part of the operation which depends on the enlargement or diminution of the design only once; and instead of printing from the soft substance transferring the design from it to stone thus a considerable portion of the work would be reduced to an art already well known that of lithography this idea receives some confirmation from the fact that in another set of specimens consisting of a map of st petersburgh of several sizes a very short line evidently an accidental defect occurs in all the impressions of one particular size but not in any of a different size  machine to produce engraving from medals an instrument was contrived a long time ago and is described in the manuel de tourneur by which copperplate engravings are produced from medals and other objects in relief the medal and the copper are fixed on two sliding plates at right angles to each other so connected that when the plate on which the medal is fixed is raised vertically by a screw the slide holding the copperplate is advanced by an equal quantity in the horizontal direction the medal is fixed on the vertical slide with its face towards the copperplate and a little above it a bar terminating at one end in a tracing point and at the other in a short arm at right angles to the bar and holding a diamond point is placed horizontally above the copper; so that the tracing point shall touch the medal to which the bar is perpendicular and the diamond point shall touch the copperplate to which the arm is perpendicular under this arrangement the bar being supposed to move parallel to itself and consequently to the copper if the tracing point pass over a flat part of the medal the diamond point will draw a straight line of equal length upon the copper; but if the tracing point pass over any projecting part of the medal the deviation from the straight line by the diamond point will be exactly equal to the elevation of the corresponding point of the medal above the rest of the surface thus by the transit of this tracing point over any line upon the medal the diamond will draw upon the copper a section of the medal through that line a screw is attached to the apparatus so that if the medal be raised a very small quantity by the screw the copperplate will be advanced by the same quantity and thus a new line of section may be drawn and by continuing this process the series of sectional lines on the copper produces the representation of the medal on a plane the outline and the form of the figure arising from the sinuosities of the lines and from their greater or less proximity the effect of this kind of engraving is very striking; and in some specimens gives a high degree of apparent relief it has been practised on plate glass and is then additionally curious from the circumstance of the fine lines traced by the diamond being invisible except in certain lights from this description it will have been seen that the engraving on copper must be distorted; that is to say that the projection on the copper cannot be the same as that which arises from a perpendicular projection of each point of the medal upon a plane parallel to itself the position of the prominent parts will be more altered than that of the less elevated; and the greater the relief of the medal the more distorted will be its engraved representation mr john bate son of mr bate of the poultry has contrived an improved machine for which he has taken a patent in which this source of distortion is remedied the head in the title page of the present volume is copied from a medal of roger bacon which forms one of a series of medals of eminent men struck at the royal mint at munich and is the first of the published productions of this new art the inconvenience which arises from too high a relief in the medal or in the bust might be remedied by some mechanical contrivance by which the deviation of the diamond point from the right line which it would describe when the tracing point traverses a plane would be made proportional not to the elevation of the corresponding point above the plane of the medal but to its elevation above some other parallel plane removed to a fit distance behind it thus busts and statues might be reduced to any required degree of relief  the machine just described naturally suggests other views which seem to deserve some consideration and perhaps some experiment if a medal were placed under the tracing point of a pentagraph an engraving tool substituted for the pencil and a copperplate in the place of the paper; and if by some mechanism the tracing point which slides in a vertical plane could as it is carried over the different elevations of the medal increase or diminish the depth of the engraved line proportionally to the actual height of the corresponding point on the medal then an engraving would be produced free at least from any distortion although it might be liable to objections of a different kind if by any similar contrivance instead of lines we could make on each point of the copper a dot varying in size or depth with the altitude of the corresponding point of the medal above its plane than a new species of engraving would be produced and the variety of these might again be increased by causing the graving point to describe very small circles of diameters varying with the height of the point on the medal above a given plane; or by making the graving tool consist of three equidistant points whose distance increased or diminished according to some determinate law dependent on the elevation of the point represented above the plane of the medal it would perhaps be difficult to imagine the effects of some of these kinds of engraving; but they would all possess in common the property of being projections by parallel lines of the objects represented and the intensity of the shade of the ink would either vary according to some function of the distance of the point represented from some given plane or it would be a little modified by the distances from the same plane of a few of the immediately contiguous points  the system of shading maps by means of lines of equal altitude above the sea bears some analogy to this mode of representing medals and if applied to them would produce a different species of engraved resemblance the projections on the plane of the medal of the section of an imaginary plane placed at successive distances above it with the medal itself would produce a likeness of the figure on the medal in which all the inclined parts of it would be dark in proportion to their inclination other species of engraving might be conceived by substituting instead of the imaginary plane an imaginary sphere or other solid intersecting the figure in the medal  lace made by caterpillars a most extraordinary species of manufacture which is in a slight degree connected with copying has been contrived by an officer of engineers residing at munich it consists of lace and veils with open patterns in them made entirely by caterpillars the following is the mode of proceeding adopted he makes a paste of the leaves of the plant which is the usual food of the species of caterpillar he employs and spreads it thinly over a stone or other flat substance he then with a camelhair pencil dipped in olive oil draws upon the coating of paste the pattern he wishes the insects to leave open this stone is then placed in an inclined position and a number of the caterpillars are placed at the bottom a peculiar species is chosen which spins a strong web; and the animals commencing at the bottom eat and spin their way up to the top carefully avoiding every part touched by the oil but devouring all the rest of the paste the extreme lightness of these veils combined with some strength is truly surprising one of them measuring twentysix and a half inches by seventeen inches weighed only grains; a degree of lightness which will appear more strongly by contrast with other fabrics one square yard of the substance of which these veils are made weighs  grains whilst one square yard of silk gauze weighs grains and one square yard of the finest patent net weighs  grains the ladies' coloured muslin dresses mentioned in the table subjoined cost ten shillings per dress and each weigh six ounces; the cotton from which they are made weighing nearly six and twoninth ounces avoirdupois weight weight of one square yard of each of the following articles          weight of       weight cotton used     value  finished of

copying is the foundation may be terminated with an example which has long been under the eye of the reader; although few perhaps are aware of the number of repeated copyings of which these very pages are the subject  they are copies by printing from stereotype plates  these stereotype plates are copied by the art of casting from moulds formed of plaster of paris  these moulds are themselves copied by casting the plaster in a liquid state upon the moveable types set up by the compositor it is here that the union of the intellectual and the mechanical departments takes place the mysteries however of an author's copying form no part of our enquiry although it may be fairly remarked that in numerous instances the mental far eclipses the mechanical copyist  these moveable types the obedient messengers of the most opposite thoughts the most conflicting theories are themselves copies by casting from moulds of copper called matrices  the lower part of those matrices bearing the impressions of the letters or characters are copies by punching from steel punches on which the same characters exist in relief  these steel punches are not themselves entirely exempted from the great principle of art many of the cavities which exist in them such as those in the middle of the punches for the letters a b d e g etc are produced from other steel punches in which these parts are in relief we have thus traced through six successive stages of copying the mechanical art of printing from stereotype plates the principle of copying contributing in this as in every other department of manufacture to the uniformity and the cheapness of the work produced notes  the late mr lowry  i posses a lithographic reprint of a page of a table which appears from the from of the type to have been several years old  the construction of the engraving becomes evident on examining it with a lens of sufficient power to show the continuity of the lines  the phalaena pardilla which feeds on the prunus padus  some of these weights and measures are calculated from a statement in the report of the committee of the house of commons on printed cotton goods; and the widths of the pieces there given are presumed to be the real widths not those by which they are called in the retail shops  chapter  on the method of observing manufactories  having now reviewed the mechanical principles which regulate the successful application of mechanical science to great establishments for the production of manufactured goods it remains for us to suggest a few enquiries and to offer a few observations to those whom an enlightened curiosity may lead to examine the factories of this or of other countries the remarkthat it is important to commit to writing all information as soon as possible after it is received especially when numbers are concernedapplies to almost all enquiries it is frequently impossible to do this at the time of visiting an establishment although not the slightest jealousy may exist; the mere act of writing information as it is communicated orally is a great interruption to the examination of machinery in such cases therefore it is advisable to have prepared beforehand the questions to be asked and to leave blanks for the answers which may be quickly inserted as in a multitude of cases they are merely numbers those who have not tried this plan will be surprised at the quantity of information which may through its means be acquired even by a short examination each manufacture requires its own list of questions which will be better drawn up after the first visit the following outline which is very generally applicable may suffice for an illustration; and to save time it may be convenient to have it printed; and to bind up in the form of a pocketbook a hundred copies of the skeleton forms for processes with about twenty of the general enquiries  general enquiries  outlines of a description of any of the mechanical arts ought to contain information on the following points brief sketch of its history particularly the date of its invention and of its introduction into england short reference to the previous states through which the material employed has passed the places whence it is procured the price of a given quantity the various processes must now be described successively according to the plan which will be given in ; after which the following information should be given are various kinds of the same article made in one establishment or at different ones and are there differences in the processes? to what defects are the goods liable? what substitutes or adulterations are used? what waste is allowed by the master? what tests are there of the goodness of the manufactured articles? the weight of a given quantity or number and a comparison with that of the raw material? the wholesale price at the manufactory? l s d per the usual retail price? l s d who provide tools? master or men? who repair tools? master or men? what is the expense of the machinery? what is the annual wear and tear and what its duration? is there any particular trade for making it? where? is it made and repaired at the manufactory? in any manufactory visited state the number  of processes; and of the persons employed in each process; and the quantity of manufactured produce what quantity is made annually in great britain? is the capital invested in manufactories large or small? mention the principal seats of this manufacture in england; and if it flourishes abroad the places where it is established the duty excise or bounty if any should be stated and any alterations in past years; and also the amount exported or imported for a series of years whether the same article but of superior equal or inferior make is imported? does the manufacturer export or sell to a middleman who supplies the merchant? to what countries is it chiefly sent? and in what goods are the returns made?  each process requires a separate skeleton and the following outline will be sufficient for many different manufactories  process  manufacture  place  name  date  the mode of executing it with sketches of the tools or machine if necessary the number of persons necessary to attend the machine are the operatives men  women  or children?  if mixed what are the proportions? what is the pay of each? s d s d s d per  what number  of hours do they work per day? is it usual or necessary to work night and day without stopping? is the labour performed by pieceor by daywork? who provide tools? master or men? who repair tools? master or men? what degree of skill is required and how many years'  apprenticeship? the number of times  the operation is repeated per day or per hour? the number of failures  in a thousand? whether the workmen or the master loses by the broken or damaged articles? what is done with them? if the same process is repeated several times state the diminution or increase of measure and the loss if any at each repetition  in this skeleton the answers to the questions are in some cases printed as who repair the tools?masters men; in order that the proper answer may be underlined with a pencil in filling up the answers which require numbers some care should be taken for instance if the observer stands with his watch in his hand before a person heading a pin the workman will almost certainly increase his speed and the estimate will be too large a much better average will result from enquiring what quantity is considered a fair day's work when this cannot be ascertained the number of operations performed in a given time may frequently be counted when the workman is quite unconscious that any person is observing him thus the sound made by the motion of a loom may enable the observer to count the number of strokes per minute even though he is outside the building in which it is contained m coulomb who had great experience in making such observations cautions those who may repeat his experiments against being deceived by such circumstances 'je prie' says he 'ceux qui voudront les repeter s'ils n'ont pas le temps de mesurer les resultats apres plusiers jours d'un travail continu d'observer les ouvriers a differentes reprises dans la journee sans qu'ils sachent qu'ils sont observes l'on ne peut trop avertir combien l'on risque de se tromper en calculant soit la vitesse soit le temps effectif du travail d'apres une observation de quelques minutes' memoires de l'institut vol ii p it frequently happens that in a series of answers to such questions there are some which although given directly may also be deduced by a short calculation from others that are given or known; and advantage should always be taken of these verifications in order to confirm the accuracy of the statements; or in case they are discordant to correct the apparent anomalies in putting lists of questions into the hands of a person undertaking to give information upon any subject it is in some cases desirable to have an estimate of the soundness of his judgement the questions can frequently be so shaped that some of them may indirectly depend on others; and one or two may be inserted whose answers can be obtained by other methods nor is this process without its advantages in enabling us to determine the value of our own judgement the habit of forming an estimate of the magnitude of any object or the frequency of any occurrence immediately previous to our applying to it measure or number tends materially to fix the attention and to improve the judgement section ii on the domestic and political economy of manufactures  chapter  distinction between making and manufacturing  the economical principles which regulate the application of machinery and which govern the interior of all our great factories are quite as essential to the prosperity of a great commercial country as are those mechanical principles the operation of which has been illustrated in the preceding section the first object of every person who attempts to make any article of consumption is or ought to be to produce it in a perfect form; but in order to secure to himself the greatest and most permanent profit he must endeavour by every means in his power to render the new luxury or want which he has created cheap to those who consume it the larger number of purchasers thus obtained will in some measure secure him from the caprices of fashion whilst it furnishes a far greater amount of profit although the contribution of each individual is diminished the importance of collecting data for the purpose of enabling the manufacturer to ascertain how many additional customers he will acquire by a given reduction in the price of the article he makes cannot be too strongly pressed upon the attention of those who employ themselves in statistical enquiries in some ranks of society no diminution of price can bring forward a great additional number of customers; whilst amongst other classes a very small reduction will so enlarge the sale as to yield a considerable increase of profit materials calculated to assist in forming a table of the numbers of persons who possess incomes of different amount occur in the th report of the commissioners of revenue inquiry which includes a statement of the amount of personal property proved at the legacy office during one year; the number of the various classes of testators; and an account of the number of persons receiving dividends from funded property distributed into classes such a table formed even approximately and exhibited in the form of a curve might be of service  a considerable difference exists between the terms making and manufacturing the former refers to the production of a small the latter to that of a very large number of individuals; and the difference is well illustrated in the evidence given before the committee of the house of commons on the export of tools and machinery on that occasion mr maudslay stated that he had been applied to by the navy board to make iron tanks for ships and that he was rather unwilling to do so as he considered it to be out of his line of business; however he undertook to make one as a trial the holes for the rivets were punched by handpunching with presses and the holes which each tank required cost seven shillings the navy board who required a large number proposed that he should supply forty tanks a week for many months the magnitude of the order made it worth his while to commence manufacture and to make tools for the express business mr maudslay therefore offered if the board would give him an order for two thousand tanks to supply them at the rate of eighty per week the order was given he made tools by which the expense of punching the rivetholes of each tank was reduced from seven shillings to ninepence; he supplied ninetyeight tanks a week for six months and the price charged for each was reduced from seventeen pounds to fifteen  if therefore the maker of an article wish to become a manufacturer in the more extended sense of the term he must attend to other principles besides those mechanical ones on which the successful execution of his work depends; and he must carefully arrange the whole system of his factory in such a manner that the article he sells to the public may be produced at as small a cost as possible should he not be actuated at first by motives so remote he will in every highly civilized country be compelled by the powerful stimulus of competition to attend to the principles of the domestic economy of manufactures at every reduction in price of the commodity he makes he will be driven to seek compensation in a saving of expense in some of the processes; and his ingenuity will be sharpened in this enquiry by the hope of being able in his turn to undersell his rivals the benefit of the improvements thus engendered is for a short time confined to those from whose ingenuity they derive their origin; but when a sufficient experience has proved their value they become generally adopted until in their turn they are superseded by other more economical methods  chapter  of money as a medium of exchange  in the earlier stages of societies the interchange of the few commodities required was conducted by barter but as soon as their wants became more varied and extensive the necessity of having some common measure of the value of all commodities itself capable of subdivisionbecame apparent thus money was introduced in some countries shells have been employed for this purpose; but civilized nations have by common consent adopted the precious metals the sovereign power has in most countries assumed the right of coining; or in other words the right of stamping with distinguishing marks pieces of metal having certain forms and weights and a certain degree of fineness the marks becoming a guarantee to the people amongst whom the money circulates that each piece is of the required weight and quality the expense of manufacturing gold into coin and that of the loss arising from wear as well as of interest on the capital invested in it must either be defrayed by the state or be compensated by a small reduction in its weight and is a far less cost to the nation than the loss of time and inconvenience which would arise from a system of exchange or barter  these coins are liable to two inconveniences they may be manufactured privately by individuals of the same quality and similarly stamped; or imitations may be made of inferior metal or of diminished weight the first of these inconveniences would be easily remedied by making the current value of the coin nearly equal to that of the same weight of the metal; and the second would be obviated by the caution of individuals in examining the external characters of each coin and partly by the punishment inflicted by the state on the perpetrators of such frauds  the subdivisions of money vary in different countries and much time may be lost by an inconvenient system of division the effect is felt in keeping extensive accounts and particularly in calculating the interest on loans or the discount upon bills of exchange the decimal system is the best adapted to facilitate all such calculations; and it becomes an interesting question to consider whether our own currency might not be converted into one decimally divided the great step that of abolishing the guinea has already been taken without any inconvenience and but little is now required to render the change complete  if whenever it becomes necessary to call in the halfcrowns a new coin of the value of two shillings were issued which should be called by some name implying a unit a prince for instance we should have the tenth part of a sovereign a few years after when the public were familiar with this coin it might be divided into one hundred instead of ninetysix farthings; and it would then consist of twentyfive pence each of which would be four per cent less in value than the former penny the shillings and sixpences being then withdrawn from circulation their place might be supplied with silver coins each worth five of the new pence and by others of tenpence and of twopence halfpenny; the latter coin having a distinct name would be the tenth part of a prince  the various manufactured commodities and the various property possessed by the inhabitants of a country all become measured by the standard thus introduced but it must be observed that the value of gold is itself variable; and that like all other commodities its price depends on the extent of the demand compared with that of the supply  as transactions multiply and the sums to be paid become large the actual transfer of the precious metals from one individual to another is attended with inconvenience and difficulty and it is found more convenient to substitute written promises to pay on demand specified quantities of gold these promises are called banknotes; and when the person or body issuing them is known to be able to fulfil the pledge the note will circulate for a long time before it gets into the hands of any person who may wish to make use of the gold it represents these paper representatives supply the place of a certain quantity of gold; and being much cheaper a large portion of the expense of a metallic circulation is saved by their employment  as commercial transactions increase the transfer of banknotes is to a considerable extent superseded by shorter processes banks are established into which all monies are paid and out of which all payments are made through written orders called checks drawn by those who keep accounts with them in a large capital each bank receives through its numerous customers checks payable by every other; and if clerks were sent round to receive the amount in banknotes due from each it would occupy much time and be attended with some risk and inconvenience  clearing house in london this is avoided by making all checks paid in to bankers pass through what is technically called the clearing house in a large room in lombard street about thirty clerks from the several london bankers take their stations in alphabetical order at desks placed round the room; each having a small open box by his side and the name of the firm to which he belongs in large characters on the wall above his head from time to time other clerks from every house enter the room and passing along drop into the box the checks due by that firm to the house from which this distributor is sent the clerk at the table enters the amount of the several checks in a book previously prepared under the name of the bank to which they are respectively due four o'clock in the afternoon is the latest hour to which the boxes are open to receive checks; and at a few minutes before that time some signs of increased activity begin to appear in this previously quiet and businesslike scene numerous clerks then arrive anxious to distribute up to the latest possible moment the checks which have been paid into the houses of their employers at four o'clock all the boxes are removed and each clerk adds up the amount of the checks put into his box and payable by his own to other houses he also receives another book from his own house containing the amounts of the checks which their distributing clerk has put into the box of every other banker having compared these he writes out the balances due to or from his own house opposite the name of each of the other banks; and having verified this statement by a comparison with the similar list made by the clerks of those houses he sends to his own bank the general balance resulting from this sheet the amount of which if it is due from that to other houses is sent back in banknotes at five o'clock the inspector takes his seat; when each clerk who has upon the result of all the transactions a balance to pay to various other houses pays it to the inspector who gives a ticket for the amount the clerks of those houses to whom money is due then receive the several sums from the inspector who takes from them a ticket for the amount thus the whole of these payments are made by a double system of balance a very small amount of banknotes passing from hand to hand and scarcely any coin  it is difficult to form a satisfactory estimate of the sums which daily pass through this operation they fluctuate from two millions to perhaps fifteen about two millions and a half may possibly be considered as something like an average requiring for its adjustment perhaps l in bank notes and l in specie by an agreement between the different bankers all checks which have the name of any firm written across them must pass through the clearing house consequently if any such check should be lost the firm on which it is drawn would refuse to pay it at the counter; a circumstance which adds greatly to the convenience of commerce the advantage of this system is such that two meetings a day have been recently establishedone at twelve the other at three o'clock; but the payment of balances takes place once only at five o'clock if all the private banks kept accounts with the bank of england it would be possible to carry on the whole of these transactions with a still smaller quantity of circulating medium  in reflecting on the facility with which these vast transactions are accomplishedsupposing for the sake of argument that they form only the fourth part of the daily transactions of the whole communityit is impossible not to be struck with the importance of interfering as little as possible with their natural adjustment each payment indicates a transfer of property made for the benefit of both parties; and if it were possible which it is not to place by legal or other means some impediment in the way which only amounted to oneeighth per cent such a species of friction would produce a useless expenditure of nearly four millions annually a circumstance which is deserving the attention of those who doubt the good policy of the expense incurred by using the precious metals for one portion of the currency of the country  one of the most obvious differences between a metallic and a paper circulation is that the coin can never by any panic or national danger be reduced below the value of bullion in other civilized countries; whilst a paper currency may from the action of such causes totally lose its value both metallic and paper money it is true may be depreciated but with very different effects  depreciation of coin the state may issue coin of the same nominal value but containing only half the original quantity of gold mixed with some cheap alloy; but every piece so issued bears about with it internal evidence of the amount of the depreciation it is not necessary that every successive proprietor should analyse the new coin; but a few having done so its intrinsic worth becomes publicly known of course the coin previously in circulation is now more valuable as bullion and quickly disappears all future purchases adjust themselves to the new standard and prices are quickly doubled; but all past contracts also are vitiated and all persons to whom money is owing if compelled to receive payment in the new coin are robbed of onehalf of their debt which is confiscated for the benefit of the debtor  depreciation of paper the depreciation of paper money follows a different course if by any act of the government paper is ordained to be a legal tender for debts and at the same time ceases to be exchangeable for coin those who have occasion to purchase of foreigners who are not compelled to take the notes will make some of their payments in gold; and if the issue of paper unchecked by the power of demanding the gold it represents be continued the whole of the coin will soon disappear but the public who are obliged to take the notes are unable by any internal evidence to detect the extent of their depreciation; it varies with the amount in circulation and may go on till the notes shall be worth little more than the paper on which they are printed during the whole of this time every creditor is suffering to an extent which he cannot measure; and every bargain is rendered uncertain in its advantage by the continually changing value of the medium through which it is conducted this calamitous course has actually been run in several countries in france it reached nearly its extreme limit during the existence of assignats we have ourselves experienced some portion of the misery it creates; but by a return to sounder principles have happily escaped the destruction and ruin which always attends the completion of that career  every person in a civilized country requires according to his station in life the use of a certain quantity of money to make the ordinary purchases of the articles which he consumes the same individual pieces of coin it is true circulate again and again in the same district the identical piece of silver received by the workman on saturday night passing through the hands of the butcher the baker and the small tradesman is perhaps given by the latter to the manufacturer in exchange for his check and is again paid into the hands of the workman at the end of the succeeding week any deficiency in this supply of money is attended with considerable inconvenience to all parties if it be only in the smaller coins the first effect is a difficulty in procuring small change; then a disposition in the shopkeepers to refuse change unless a purchase to a certain amount be made; and finally a premium in money will be given for changing the larger denominations of coin thus money itself varies in price when measured by other money in larger masses and this effect takes place whether the circulating medium is metallic or of paper these effects have constantly occurred and particularly during the late war; and in order to relieve it silver tokens for various sums were issued by the bank of england the inconvenience and loss arising from a deficiency of small money fall with greatest weight on the classes whose means are least; for the wealthier buyers can readily procure credit for their small purchases until their bill amounts to one of the larger coins  as money when kept in a drawer produces nothing few people in any situation of life will keep either in coin or in notes more than is immediately necessary for their use; when therefore there are no profitable modes of employing money a superabundance of paper will return to the source from whence it issued and an excess of coin will be converted into bullion and exported  since the worth of all property is measured by money it is obviously conducive to the general welfare of the community that fluctuations in its value should be rendered as small and as gradual as possible the evils which result from sudden changes in the value of money will perhaps become more sensible if we trace their effects in particular instances assuming as we are quite at liberty to do an extreme case let us suppose three persons each possessing a hundred pounds one of these a widow advanced in years and who by the advice of her friends purchases with that sum an annuity of twenty pounds a year during her life and let the two others be workmen who by industry and economy have each saved a hundred pounds out of their wages; both these latter persons proposing to procure machines for calendering and to commence that business one of these invests his money in a savings' bank; intending to make his own calendering machine and calculating that he shall expend twenty pounds in materials and the remaining eighty in supporting himself and in paying the workmen who assist him in constructing it the other workman meeting with a machine which he can buy for two hundred pounds agrees to pay for it a hundred pounds immediately and the remainder at the end of a twelvemonth let us now imagine some alteration to take place in the currency by which it is depreciated onehalf prices soon adjust themselves to the new circumstances and the annuity of the widow though nominally of the same amount will in reality purchase only half the quantity of the necessaries of life which it did before the workman who had placed his money in the savings' bank having perhaps purchased ten pounds' worth of materials and expended ten pounds in labour applied to them now finds himself by this alteration in the currency possessed nominally of eighty pounds but in reality of a sum which will purchase only half the labour and materials required to finish his machine; and he can neither complete it from want of capital nor dispose of what he has already done in its unfinished state for the price it has cost him in the meantime the other workman who had incurred a debt of a hundred pounds in order to complete the purchase of his calendering machine finds that the payments he receives for calendering have like all other prices doubled in consequence of the depreciation of the currency; and he has therefore in fact obtained his machine for one hundred and fifty pounds thus without any fault or imprudence and owing to circumstances over which they have no control the widow is reduced almost to starve; one workman is obliged to renounce for several years his hope of becoming a master; and another without any superior industry or skill but in fact from having made with reference to his circumstances rather an imprudent bargain finds himself unexpectedly relieved from half his debt and the possessor of a valuable source of profit; whilst the former owner of the machine if he also has invested the money arising from its sale in the savings' bank finds his property suddenly reduced onehalf  these evils to a greater or less extent attend every change in the value of the currency; and the importance of preserving it as far as possible unaltered in value cannot be too strongly impressed upon all classes of the community notes  in russia platinum has been employed for coin; and it possesses a peculiarity which deserves notice platinum cannot be melted in our furnaces and is chiefly valuable in commerce when in the shape of ingots from which it may be forged into useful forms but when a piece of platinum is cut into two parts it cannot easily be reunited except by means of a chemical process in which both parts are dissolved in an acid hence when platinum coin is too abundant it cannot like gold be reduced into masses by melting but must pass through an expensive process to render it useful  chapter  on the influence of verification on price  the money price of an article at any given period is usually stated to depend upon the proportion between the supply and the demand the average price of the same article during a long period is said to depend ultimately on the power of producing and selling it with the ordinary profits of capital but these principles although true in their general sense are yet so often modified by the influence of others that it becomes necessary to examine a little into the disturbing forces  with respect to the first of these propositions it may be observed that the cost of any article to the purchaser includes besides the ratio of the supply to the demand another element which though often of little importance is in many cases of great consequence the cost to the purchaser is the price he pays for any article added to the cost of verifying the fact of its having that degree of goodness for which he contracts in some cases the goodness of the article is evident on mere inspection and in those cases there is not much difference of price at different shops the goodness of loaf sugar for instance can be discerned almost at a glance; and the consequence is that the price is so uniform and the profit upon it so small that no grocer is at all anxious to sell it; whilst on the other hand tea of which it is exceedingly difficult to judge and which can be adulterated by mixture so as to deceive the skill even of a practised eye has a great variety of different prices and is that article which every grocer is most anxious to sell to his customers the difficulty and expense of verification are in some instances so great as to justify the deviation from wellestablished principles thus it is a general maxim that government can purchase any article at a cheaper rate than that at which they can manufacture it themselves but it has nevertheless been considered more economical to build extensive flourmills such are those at deptford and to grind their own corn than to verify each sack of purchased flour and to employ persons in devising methods of detecting the new modes of adulteration which might be continually resorted to  some years since a mode of preparing old clover and trefoil seeds by a process called doctoring became so prevalent as to excite the attention of the house of commons it appeared in evidence before a committee that the old seed of the white clover was doctored by first wetting it slightly and then drying it with the fumes of burning sulphur and that the red clover seed had its colour improved by shaking it in a sack with a small quantity of indigo; but this being detected after a time the doctors then used a preparation of logwood fined by a little copperas and sometimes by verdigris; thus at once improving the appearance of the old seed and diminishing if not destroying its vegetative power already enfeebled by age supposing no injury had resulted to good seed so prepared it was proved that from the improved appearance the market price would be enhanced by this process from five to twentyfive shillings a hundred weight but the greatest evil arose from the circumstance of these processes rendering old and worthless seed equal in appearance to the best one witness had tried some doctored seed and found that not above one grain in a hundred grew and that those which did vegetate died away afterwards; whilst about eighty or ninety per cent of good seed usually grows the seed so treated was sold to retail dealers in the country who of course endeavoured to purchase at the cheapest rate and from them it got into the hands of the farmers; neither of these classes being capable of distinguishing the fraudulent from the genuine seed many cultivators in consequence diminished their consumption of the article; and others were obliged to pay a higher price to those who had skill to distinguish the mixed seed and who had integrity and character to prevent them from dealing in it  in the irish flax trade a similar example of the high price paid for verification occurs it is stated in the report of the committee that the natural excellent quality of irish flax as contrasted with foreign or british has been admitted yet from the evidence before that committee it appears that irish flax sells in the market from d to d per pound less than other flax of equal or inferior quality part of this difference of price arises from negligence in its preparation but a part also from the expense of ascertaining that each parcel is free from useless matter to add to its weight this appears from the evidence of mr j corry who was during twentyseven years secretary to the irish linenboard the owners of the flax who are almost always people in the lower classes of life believe that they can best advance their own interests by imposing on the buyers flax being sold by weight various expedients are used to increase it; and every expedient is injurious particularly the damping of it; a very common practice which makes the flax afterwards heat the inside of every bundle and the bundles all vary in bulk is often full of pebbles or dirt of various kinds to increase the weight in this state it is purchased and exported to great britain the natural quality of irish flax is admitted to be not inferior to that produced by any foreign country; and yet the flax of every foreign country imported into great britain obtains a preference amongst the purchasers because the foreign flax is brought to the british market in a cleaner and more regular state the extent and value of the sales of foreign flax in great britain can be seen by reference to the public accounts; and i am induced to believe that ireland by an adequate extension of her flax tillage and having her flax markets brought under good regulations could without encroaching in the least degree upon the quantity necessary for her home consumption supply the whole of the demand of the british market to the exclusion of the foreigners  the lace trade affords other examples; and in enquiring into the complaints made to the house of commons by the framework knitters the committee observe that it is singular that the grievance most complained of one hundred and fifty years ago should in the present improved state of the trade be the same grievance which is now most complained of for it appears by the evidence given before your committee that all the witnesses attribute the decay of the trade more to the making of fraudulent and bad articles than to the war or to any other cause and it is shewn by the evidence that a kind of lace called singlepress was manufactured which although good to the eye became nearly spoiled in washing by the slipping of the threads; that not one person in a thousand could distinguish the difference between singlepress and doublepress lace; and that even workmen and manufacturers were obliged to employ a magnifying glass for that purpose; and that in another similar article called warp lace such aid was essential it was also stated by one witness that the trade had not yet ceased excepting in those places where the fraud had been discovered; and from those places no orders are now sent for any sort of nottingham lace the credit being totally ruined  in the stocking trade similar frauds have been practised it appeared in evidence that stockings were made of uniform width from the knee down to the ankle and being wetted and stretched on frames at the calf they retained their shape when dry but that the purchaser could not discover the fraud until after the first washing the stockings hung like bags about his ankles  in the watch trade the practice of deceit in forging the marks and names of respectable makers has been carried to a great extent both by natives and foreigners; and the effect upon our export trade has been most injurious as the following extract from the evidence before a committee of the house of commons will prove question how long have you been in the trade? answer nearly thirty years question the trade is at present much depressed? answer yes sadly question what is your opinion of the cause of that distress? answer i think it is owing to a number of watches that have been made so exceedingly bad that they will hardly look at them in the foreign markets; all with a handsome outside show and the works hardly fit for anything question do you mean to say that all the watches made in this country are of that description? answer no; only a number which are made up by some of the jews and other low manufacturers i recollect something of the sort years ago of a falloff of the east india work owing to there being a number of handsomelooking watches sent out for instance with hands on and figures as if they shewed seconds and had not any work regular to shew the seconds the hand went round but it was not regular question they had no perfect movements? answer no they had not; that was a long time since and we had not any east india work for a long time afterwards in the home market inferior but showy watches are made at a cheap rate which are not warranted by the maker to go above half an hour; about the time occupied by the jew pedlar in deluding his country customer  the practice in retail linendrapers' shops of calling certain articles yard wide when the real width is perhaps only seveneighths or threequarters arose at first from fraud which being detected custom was pleaded in its defence but the result is that the vender is constantly obliged to measure the width of his goods in the customer's presence in all these instances the object of the seller is to get a higher price than his goods would really produce if their quality were known; and the purchaser if not himself a skilful judge which rarely happens to be the case must pay some person in the shape of an additional money price who has skill to distinguish and integrity to furnish articles of the quality agreed on but as the confidence of persons in their own judgement is usually great large numbers will always flock to the cheap dealer who thus attracting many customers from the honest tradesman obliges him to charge a higher price for his judgement and character than without such competition he could afford to do  there are few things which the public are less able to judge of than the quality of drugs; and when these are compounded into medicines it is scarcely possible even for medical men to decide whether pure or adulterated ingredients have been employed this circumstance concurring with the present injudicious mode of paying for medical assistance has produced a curious effect on the price of medicines apothecaries instead of being paid for their services and skill are remunerated by being allowed to place a high charge upon their medicines which are confessedly of very small pecuniary value the effect of such a system is an inducement to prescribe more medicine than is necessary; and in fact even with the present charges the apothecary in ninetynine cases out of a hundred cannot be fairly remunerated unless the patient either takes or pays for more physic than he really requires the apparent extravagance of the charge of eighteen pence for a twoounce phial of medicine is obvious to many who do not reflect on the fact that a great part of the charge is in reality payment for the exercise of professional skill as the same charge is made by the apothecary whether he attends the patient or merely prepares the prescription of a physician the chemist and druggist soon offered to furnish the same commodity at a greatly diminished price but the eighteen pence charged by the apothecary might have been fairly divided into two parts three pence for medicine and bottle and fifteen pence for attendance the chemist therefore who never attends his customers if he charges only a shilling for the same medicine realizes a profit of or per cent upon its value this enormous profit has called into existence a multitude of competitors; and in this instance the impossibility of verifying has in a great measure counteracted the beneficial effects of competition the general adulteration of drugs even at the extremely high price at which they are retailed as medicine enables those who are supposed to sell them in an unadulterated state to make large profits whilst the same evil frequently disappoints the expectation and defeats the skill of the most eminent physician it is difficult to point out a remedy for this evil without suggesting an almost total change in the system of medical practice if the apothecary were to charge for his visits and to reduce his medicines to onefourth or onefifth of their present price he would still have an interest in procuring the best drugs for the sake of his own reputation or skill or if the medical attendant who is paid more highly for his time were to have several pupils he might himself supply the medicines without a specific charge and his pupils would derive improvement from compounding them as well as from examining the purity of the drugs he would purchase the public would gain several advantages by this arrangement in the first place it would be greatly for the interest of the medical practitioner to have the best drugs; it would be in his interest also not to give more physic than needful; and it would enable him through some of his more advanced pupils to watch more frequently the changes of any malady  there are many articles of hardware which it is impossible for the purchaser to verify at the time of purchase or even afterwards without defacing them plated harness and coach furniture may be adduced as examples these are usually of wrought iron covered with silver owing their strength to the one and a certain degree of permanent beauty to the other metal both qualities are occasionally much impaired by substituting cast for wroughtiron and by plating with soft solder tin and lead instead of with hard solder silver and brass the loss of strength is the greatest evil in this case; for cast iron though made for this purpose more tough than usual by careful annealing is still much weaker than wroughtiron and serious accidents often arise from harness giving way in plating with soft solder a very thin plate of silver is made to cover the iron but it is easily detached particularly by a low degree of heat hard soldering gives a better coat of silver which is very firmly attached and is not easily injured unless by a very high degree of heat the inferior can be made to look nearly as well as the better article and the purchaser can scarcely discover the difference without cutting into it  the principle that price at any moment is dependent on the relation of the supply to the demand is true to the full extent only when the whole supply is in the hands of a very large number of small holders and the demand is caused by the wants of another set of persons each of whom requires only a very small quantity and the reason appears to be that it is only in such circumstances that a uniform average can be struck between the feelings the passions the prejudices the opinions and the knowledge of both parties if the supply or present stock in hand be entirely in the possession of one person he will naturally endeavour to put such a price upon it as shall produce by its sale the greatest quantity of money; but he will be guided in this estimate of the price at which he will sell both by the knowledge that increased price will cause a diminished consumption and by the desire to realize his profit before a new supply shall reach the market from some other quarter if however the same stock is in the hands of several dealers there will be an immediate competition between them arising partly from their different views of the duration of the present state of supply and partly from their own peculiar circumstances with respect to the employment of their capital  the expense of ascertaining that the price charged is that which is legally due is sometimes considerable the inconvenience which this verification produces in the case of parcels sent by coaches is very great the time lost in recovering an overcharge generally amounts to so many times the value of the sum recovered that it is but rarely resorted to it seems worthy of consideration whether it would not be a convenience to the public if government were to undertake the general conveyance of parcels somewhat on the same system with that on which the post is now conducted the certainty of their delivery and the absence of all attempt at overcharge would render the prohibition of rival carriers unnecessary perhaps an experiment might be made on this subject by enlarging the weight allowed to be sent by the twopenny post and by conveying works in sheets by the general post this latter suggestion would be of great importance to literature and consequently to the circulation of knowledge as the postoffice regulations stand at present it constantly happens that persons who have an extensive reputation for science receive by post from foreign countries works or parts of works for which they are obliged to pay a most extravagant rate of postage or else refuse to take in some interesting communication in france and germany printed sheets of paper are forwarded by post at a very moderate expense and it is fit that the science and literature of england should be equally favoured  it is important if possible always to connect the name of the workman with the work he has executed this secures for him the credit or the blame he may justly deserve; and diminishes in some cases the necessity of verification the extent to which this is carried in literary works published in america is remarkable in the translation of the mecanique celeste by mr bowditch not merely the name of the printer but also those of the compositors are mentioned in the work  again if the commodity itself is of a perishable nature such for example as a cargo of ice imported into the port of london from norway a few summers since then time will supply the place of competition; and whether the article is in the possession of one or of many persons it will scarcely reach a monopoly price the history of cajeput oil during the last few months offers a curious illustration of the effect of opinion upon price in july of last year cajeput oil was sold exclusive of duty at d per ounce the disease which had ravaged the east was then supposed to be approaching our shores and its proximity created alarm at this period the oil in question began to be much talked of as a powerful remedy in that dreadful disorder; and in september it rose to the price of s and s the ounce in october there were few or no sales but in the early part of november the speculations in this substance reached their height and between the st and the th it realized the following prices s d s s d s d s s s s d s after november the holders of cajeput oil were anxious to sell at much lower rates; and in december a fresh arrival was offered by public sale at s and withdrawn being sold afterwards as it was understood by private contract at s or s d per oz since that time s d and s have been realized; and a fresh arrival which is daily expected march will probably reduce it below the price of july now it is important to notice that in november the time of greatest speculation the quantity in the market was held by few persons and that it frequently changed hands each holder being desirous to realize his profit the quantity imported since that time has also been considerable  the effect of the equalization of price by an increased number of dealers may be observed in the price of the various securities sold at the stock exchange the number of persons who deal in the per cent stock being large any one desirous of selling can always dispose of his stock at oneeighth per cent under the market price; but those who wish to dispose of bank stock or of any other securities of more limited circulation are obliged to make a sacrifice of eight or ten times this amount upon each hundred pounds value  the frequent speculations in oil tallow and other commodities which must occur to the memory of most of my readers were always founded on the principle of purchasing up all the stock on hand and agreeing for the purchase of the expected arrivals; thus proving the opinion of capitalists to be that a larger average price may be procured by the stock being held by few persons notes  apothecaries frequently purchase these phials at the old bottle warehouses at ten shillings per gross; so that when their servant has washed them the cost of the phial is nearly one penny  i have understood that the price of camphor at the same time suffered similar changes  chapter  on the influence of durability on price  having now considered the circumstances that modify what may be called the momentary amount of price we must next examine a principle which seems to have an effect on its permanent average the durability of any commodity influences its cost in a permanent manner we have already stated that what may be called the momentary price of any commodity depends upon the proportion existing between the supply and demand and also upon the cost of verification the average price during a long period will depend upon the labour required for producing and bringing it to market as well as upon the average supply and demand; but it will also be influenced by the durability of the article manufactured many things in common use are substantially consumed in using a phosphorus match articles of food and a cigar are examples of this description some things after use become inapplicable to their former purposes as paper which has been printed upon but it is yet available for the cheesemonger or the trunkmaker some articles as pens are quickly worn out by use; and some are still valuable after a long continued wear there are others few perhaps in number which never wear out; the harder precious stones when well cut and polished are of this later class the fashion of the gold or silver mounting in which they are set may vary with the taste of the age and such ornaments are constantly exposed for sale as secondhand but the gems themselves when removed from their supports are never so considered a brilliant which has successively graced the necks of a hundred beauties or glittered for a century upon patrician brows is weighed by the diamond merchant in the same scale with another which has just escaped from the wheel of the lapidary and will be purchased or sold by him at the same price per carat the great mass of commodities is intermediate in its character between these two extremes and the periods of respective duration are very various it is evident that the average price of those things which are consumed in the act of using them can never be less than that of the labour of bringing them to market they may for a short time be sold for less but under such circumstances their production must soon cease altogether on the other hand if an article never wears out its price may continue permanently below the cost of the labour expended in producing it; and the only consequence will be that no further production will take place its price will continue to be regulated by the relation of the supply to the demand; and should that at any aftertime rise for a considerable period above the cost of production it will be again produced  articles become old from actual decay or the wearing out of their parts; from improved modes of constructing them; or from changes in their form and fashion required by the varying taste of the age in the two latter cases their utility is but little diminished; and being less sought after by those who have hitherto employed them they are sold at a reduced price to a class of society rather below that of their former possessors many articles of furniture such as wellmade tables and chairs are thus found in the rooms of those who would have been quite unable to have purchased them when new; and we find constantly even in the houses of the more opulent large lookingglasses which have passed successively through the hands of several possessors changing only the fashion of their frames; and in some instances even this alteration is omitted an additional coat of gilding saving them from the character of being secondhand thus a taste for luxuries is propagated downwards in society' and after a short period the numbers who have acquired new wants become sufficient to excite the ingenuity of the manufacturer to reduce the cost of supplying them whilst he is himself benefited by the extended scale of demand  there is a peculiarity in lookingglasses with reference to the principle just mentioned the most frequent occasion of injury to them arises from accidental violence; and the peculiarity is that unlike most other articles when broken they are still of some value if a large mirror is accidentally cracked it is immediately cut into two or more smaller ones each of which may be perfect if the degree of violence is so great as to break it into many fragments these smaller pieces may be cut into squares for dressingglasses; and if the silvering is injured it can either be resilvered or used as plateglass for glazing windows the addition from our manufactories to the stock of plateglass in the country is annually about two hundred and fifty thousand square feet it would be very difficult to estimate the quantity annually destroyed or exported but it is probably small; and the effect of these continual additions is seen in the diminished price and increased consumption of the article almost all the better order of shop fronts are now glazed with it if it were quite indestructible the price would continually diminish; and unless an increased demand arose from new uses or from a greater number of customers a single manufactory unchecked by competition would ultimately be compelled to shut up driven out of the market by the permanance of its own productions  the metals are in some degree permanent although several of them are employed in such forms that they are ultimately lost copper is a metal of which a great proportion returns to use a part of that employed in sheathing ships and covering houses is lost from corrosion; but the rest is generally remelted some is lost in small brass articles and some is consumed in the formation of salts roman vitriol sulphate of copper verdigris acetate of copper and verditer gold is wasted in gilding and in embroidering; but a portion of this is recovered by burning the old articles some portion is lost by the wear of gold but upon the whole it possesses considerable permanence iron a proportion of this metal is wasted by oxidation in small nails in fine wire; by the wear of tools and of the tire of wheels and by the formation of some dyes but much both of cast and of wroughtiron returns to use lead is wasted in great quantities some portion of that which is used in pipes and in sheets for covering roofs returns to the meltingpot; but large quantities are consumed in the form of small shot or sometimes in that of musket balls litharge and red lead for white and red paints for glassmaking for glazing pottery and for sugar of lead acetate of lead silver is rather a permanent metal some portion is consumed in the wear of coin in that of silver plate and a portion in silvering and embroidering tin the chief waste of this metal arises from tinned iron; some is lost in solder and in solutions for the dyers  chapter  of price as measured by money  the money price at which an article sells furnishes us with comparatively little information respecting its value if we compare distant intervals of time and different countries; for gold and silver in which price is usually measured are themselves subject like all other commodities to changes in value; nor is there any standard to which these variations can be referred the average price of a certain quality of different manufactured articles or of raw produce has been suggested as a standard; but a new difficulty then presents itself; for the improved methods of producing such articles render their money price extremely variable within very limited periods the annexed table will afford a striking instance of this kind of change within a period of only twelve years  prices of the following articles at birmingham in the undermentioned years  description s d s d s d s d anvils cwt   awls polished liverpool

and factors in all our manufacturing and commercial towns to the great importance both for their own interests and for that of the population to which their capital gives employment of collecting with care such averages from the actual sales registered in their books nor perhaps would it be without its use to suggest that such averages would be still more valuable if collected from as many different quarters as possible; that the quantity of the goods from which they are deduced together with the greatest deviations from the mean ought to be given; and that if a small committee were to undertake the task it would give great additional weight to the information political economists have been reproached with too small a use of facts and too large an employment of theory if facts are wanting let it be remembered that the closetphilosopher is unfortunately too little acquainted with the admirable arrangements of the factory and that no class of persons can supply so readily and with so little sacrifice of time the data on which all the reasonings of political economists are founded as the merchant and manufacturer; and unquestionably to no class are the deductions to which they give rise so important nor let it be feared that erroneous deductions may be made from such recorded facts the errors which arise from the absence of facts are far more numerous and more durable than those which result from unsound reasoning respecting true data  the great diminution in price of the articles here enumerated may have arisen from several causes the alteration in the value of the currency the increased value of gold in consequence of the increased demand for coin the first of these causes may have had some influence and the second may have had a very small effect upon the two first quotations of prices but none at all upon the two latter ones the diminished rate of profit produced by capital however employed this may be estimated by the average price of three per cents at the periods stated the diminished price of the raw materials out of which these articles were manufactured the raw material is principally brass and iron and the reduction upon it may in some measure be estimated by the diminished price of iron and brass wire in the cost of which articles the labour bears a less proportion than it does in many of the others the smaller quantity of raw material employed and perhaps in some instances an inferior quality of workmanship the improved means by which the same effect was produced by diminished labour  in order to afford the means of estimating the influence of these several causes the following table is subjoined   average price of l s d l s d l s d l s d l s d l s d gold per oz    value of currency per cent  price of per cent

unaccompanied by any explanation might possibly lead to erroneous conclusions i subjoin the following observations for which i am indebted to the kindness of mr tooke who may yet i hope be induced to continue his valuable work on high and low prices through the important period which has elapsed since its publication 'the table commences with and exhibits a great falling off in the price of wheat and iron coincidently with a fall in the price of gold and leading to the inference of cause and effect now as regards wheat it so happened that in it reached its highest price in consequence of a series of bad harvests when relief by importation was difficult and enormously expensive in december whilst the price of gold had risen to l the price of wheat had fallen to s or per cent under what it had been in the spring of ; proving clearly that the two articles were under the influence of opposite causes 'again in the freight and insurance on swedish iron were so much higher than at present as to account for nearly the whole of the difference of price and in there had been an extensive speculation which had raised the price of all iron so that a part of the subsequent decline was a mere reaction from a previously unfounded elevation more recently in there was a great speculative rise in the article which served as a strong stimulus to increased production this aided by improved power of machinery has proceeded to such an extent as fully to account for the fall of price' to these reflections i will only add that the result of my own observation leads me to believe that by far the most influential of these causes has been the invention of cheaper modes of manufacturing the extent to which this can be carried while a profit can yet be realized at the reduced price is truly astonishing as the following fact which rests on good authority will prove twenty years since a brass knob for the locks of doors was made at birmingham; the price at that time being s d per dozen the same article is now manufactured having the same weight of metal and an equal or in fact a slightly superior finish at s d per dozen one circumstance which has produced this economy in the manufacture is that the lathe on which these knobs are finished is now turned by a steamengine; so that the workman relieved from that labour can make them twenty times as fast as he did formerly  the difference

wish to compare the value of any article at different periods of time it is clear that neither any one substance nor even the combination of all manufactured goods can furnish us with an invariable unit by which to form our scale of estimation mr malthus has proposed for this purpose to consider a day's labour of an agricultural labourer as the unit to which all value should be referred thus if we wish to compare the value of twenty yards of broad cloth in saxony at the present time with that of the same kind and quantity of cloth fabricated in england two centuries ago we must find the number of days' labour the cloth would have purchased in england at the time mentioned and compare it with the number of days' labour which the same quantity of cloth will now purchase in saxony agricultural labour appears to have been selected because it exists in all countries and employs a large number of persons and also because it requires a very small degree of previous instruction it seems in fact to be merely the exertion of a man's physical force; and its value above that of a machine of equal power arises from its portability and from the facility of directing its efforts to arbitrary and continually fluctuating purposes it may perhaps be worthy of enquiry whether a more constant average might not be deduced from combining with this species of labour those trades which require but a moderate exertion of skill and which likewise exist in all civilized countries such as those of the blacksmith and carpenter etc in all such comparisons there is however another element which though not essentially necessary will yet add much to our means of judging it is an estimate of the quantity of that food on which the labourer usually subsists which is necessary for his daily support compared with the quantity which his daily wages will purchase  the existence of a class of middlemen between small producers and merchants is frequently advantageous to both parties; and there are certain periods in the history of several manufactures which naturally call that class of traders into existence there are also times when the advantage ceasing the custom of employing them also terminates; the middlemen especially when numerous as they sometimes are in retail trades enhancing the price without equivalent good thus in the recent examination by the house of commons into the state of the coal trade it appears that fivesixths of the london public is supplied by a class of middlemen who are called in the trade brass plate coal merchants these consist principally of merchants' clerks gentlemen's servants and others who have no wharfs of their own but merely give their orders to some true coal merchant who sends in the coals from his wharf the brass plate coal merchants of course receiving a commission for his agency  in italy this system is carried to a great extent amongst the voituriers or persons who undertake to convey travellers there are some possessed of greater fluency and a more persuasive manner who frequent the inns where the english resort and who as soon as they have made a bargain for the conveyance of a traveller go out amongst their countrymen and procure some other voiturier to do the job for a considerably smaller sum themselves pocketing the difference a short time before the day of starting the contractor appears before his customer in great distress regretting his inability to perform the journey on account of the dangerous illness of a mother or some relative and requesting to have his cousin or brother substituted for him the english traveller rarely fails to acquiesce in this change and often praises the filial piety of the rogue who has deceived him notes  much information for such an enquiry is to be found for the particular period to which it refers in the report of the committee of the house of commons on manufacturers' employment july chapter  of raw materials  although the cost of any article may be reduced in its ultimate analysis to the quantity of labour by which it was produced; yet it is usual in a certain state of the manufacture of most substances to call them by the term raw material thus iron when reduced from the ore and rendered malleable is in a state fitted for application to a multitude of useful purposes and is the raw material out of which most of our tools are made in this stage of its manufacture but a moderate quantity of labour has been expended on the substance; and it becomes an interesting subject to trace the various proportions in which raw material in this sense of the term and labour unite to constitute the value of many of the productions of the arts  gold leaf consists of a portion of the metal beaten out to so great a degree of thinness as to allow a greenishblue light to be transmitted through its pores about square inches of this are sold in the form of a small book containing leaves of gold for s d in this case the raw material or gold is worth rather less than twothirds of the manufactured article in the case of silver leaf the labour considerably exceeds the value of the material a book of fifty leaves which would cover above square inches is sold for s d  we may trace the relative influence of the two causes above referred to in the prices of fine gold chains made at venice the sizes of these chains are known by numbers the smallest having been in no and the numbers  etc progressively increasing in size the following table shews the numbers and the prices of those made at that time the first column gives the number by which the chain is known; the second expresses the weight in grains of one inch in length of each chain; the third column the number of links in the same length; and the last expresses the price in francs worth tenpence each of a venetian braccio or about two english feet of each chain  venetian gold chains price of a venetian braccio equal to weight of number of links two feet inch no one inch in grains in one inch english  to  francs           amongst these chains that numbered and that numbered are exactly of the same price although the quantity of gold in the latter is twentytwo times as much as in the former the difficulty of making the smallest chain is so great that the women who make it cannot work above two hours at a time as we advance from the smaller chain the proportionate value of the work to the worth of the material becomes less and less until at the numbers and these two elements of cost balance each other after which the difficulty of the work decreases and the value of the material increases  the quantity of labour expended on these chains is however incomparably less than that which is applied in some of the manufactures of iron in the case of the smallest venetian chain the value of the labour is not above thirty times that of the gold the pendulum spring of a watch which governs the vibrations of the balance costs at the retail price two pence and weighs fifteen onehundredths of a grain whilst the retail price of a pound of the best iron the raw material out of which fifty thousand such springs are made is exactly the same sum of two pence  the

depends is the division of labour amongst the persons who perform the work the first application of this principle must have been made in a very early stage of society for it must soon have been apparent that a larger number of comforts and conveniences could be acquired by each individual if one man restricted his occupation to the art of making bows another to that of building houses a third boats and so on this division of labour into trades was not however the result of an opinion that the general riches of the community would be increased by such an arrangement; but it must have arisen from the circumstance of each individual so employed discovering that he himself could thus make a greater profit of his labour than by pursuing more varied occupations society must have made considerable advances before this principle could have been carried into the workshop; for it is only in countries which have attained a high degree of civilization and in articles in which there is a great competition amongst the producers that the most perfect system of the division of labour is to be observed the various principles on which the advantages of this system depend have been much the subject of discussion amongst writers on political economy; but the relative importance of their influence does not appear in all cases to have been estimated with sufficient precision it is my intention in the first instance to state shortly those principles and then to point out what appears to me to have been omitted by those who have previously treated the subject  of the time required for learning it will readily be admitted that the portion of time occupied in the acquisition of any art will depend on the difficulty of its execution; and that the greater the number of distinct processes the longer will be the time which the apprentice must employ in acquiring it five or seven years have been adopted in a great many trades as the time considered requisite for a lad to acquire a sufficient knowledge of his art and to enable him to repay by his labour during the latter portion of his time the expense incurred by his master at its commencement if however instead of learning all the different processes for making a needle for instance his attention be confined to one operation the portion of time consumed unprofitably at the commencement of his apprenticeship will be small and all the rest of it will be beneficial to his master and consequently if there be any competition amongst the masters the apprentice will be able to make better terms and diminish the period of his servitude again the facility of acquiring skill in a single process and the early period of life at which it can be made a source of profit will induce a greater number of parents to bring up their children to it; and from this circumstance also the number of workmen being increased the wages will soon fall  of waste of materials in learning a certain quantity of material will in all cases be consumed unprofitably or spoiled by every person who learns an art; and as he applies himself to each new process he will waste some of the raw material or of the partly manufactured commodity but if each man commit this waste in acquiring successively every process the quantity of waste will be much greater than if each person confine his attention to one process; in this view of the subject therefore the division of labour will diminish the price of production  another advantage resulting from the division of labour is the saving of that portion of time which is always lost in changing from one occupation to another when the human hand or the human head has been for some time occupied in any kind of work it cannot instantly change its employment with full effect the muscles of the limbs employed have acquired a flexibility during their exertion and those not in action a stiffness during rest which renders every change slow and unequal in the commencement long habit also produces in the muscles exercised a capacity for enduring fatigue to a much greater degree than they could support under other circumstances a similar result seems to take place in any change of mental exertion; the attention bestowed on the new subject not being so perfect at first as it becomes after some exercise  change of tools the employment of different tools in the successive processes is another cause of the loss of time in changing from one operation to another if these tools are simple and the change is not frequent the loss of time is not considerable; but in many processes of the arts the tools are of great delicacy requiring accurate adjustment every time they are used; and in many cases the time employed in adjusting bears a large proportion to that employed in using the tool the slidingrest the dividing and the drillingengine are of this kind; and hence in manufactories of sufficient extent it is found to be good economy to keep one machine constantly employed in one kind of work one lathe for example having a screw motion to its slidingrest along the whole length of its bed is kept constantly making cylinders; another having a motion for equalizing the velocity of the work at the point at which it passes the tool is kept for facing surfaces; whilst a third is constantly employed in cutting wheels  skill acquired by frequent repetition of the same processes the constant repetition of the same process necessarily produces in the workman a degree of excellence and rapidity in his particular department which is never possessed by a person who is obliged to execute many different processes this rapidity is still further increased from the circumstance that most of the operations in factories where the division of labour is carried to a considerable extent are paid for as piecework it is difficult to estimate in numbers the effect of this cause upon production in nailmaking adam smith has stated that it is almost three to one; for he observes that a smith accustomed to make nails but whose whole business has not been that of a nailer can make only from eight hundred to a thousand per day; whilst a lad who had never exercised any other trade can make upwards of two thousand three hundred a day  in different trades the economy of production arising from the lastmentioned cause will necessarily be different the case of nailmaking is perhaps rather an extreme one it must however be observed that in one sense this is not a permanent source of advantage; for though it acts at the commencement of an establishment yet every month adds to the skill of the workmen; and at the end of three or four years they will not be very far behind those who have never practised any other branch of their art upon an occasion when a large issue of banknotes was required a clerk at the bank of england signed his name consisting of seven letters including the initial of his christian name five thousand three hundred times during eleven working hours besides arranging the notes he had signed in parcels of fifty each  the division of labour suggests the contrivance of tools and machinery to execute its processes when each processes by which any article is produced is the sole occupation of one individual his whole attention being devoted to a very limited and simple operation improvements in the form of his tools or in the mode of using them are much more likely to occur to his mind than if it were distracted by a greater variety of circumstances such an improvement in the tool is generally the first step towards a machine if a piece of metal is to be cut in a lathe for example there is one particular angle at which the cuttingtool must be held to insure the cleanest cut; and it is quite natural that the idea of fixing the tool at that angle should present itself to an intelligent workman the necessity of moving the tool slowly and in a direction parallel to itself would suggest the use of a screw and thus arises the slidingrest it was probably the idea of mounting a chisel in a frame to prevent its cutting too deeply which gave rise to the common carpenter's plane in cases where a blow from a hammer is employed experience teaches the proper force required the transition from the hammer held in the hand to one mounted upon an axis and lifted regularly to a certain height by some mechanical contrivance requires perhaps a greater degree of invention than those just instanced; yet it is not difficult to perceive that if the hammer always falls from the same height its effect must be always the same  when each process has been reduced to the use of some simple tool the union of all these tools actuated by one moving power constitutes a machine in contriving tools and simplifying processes the operative workmen are perhaps most successful; but it requires far other habits to combine into one machine these scattered arts a previous education as a workman in the peculiar trade is undoubtedly a valuable preliminary; but in order to make such combinations with any reasonable expectation of success an extensive knowledge of machinery and the power of making mechanical drawings are essentially requisite these accomplishments are now much more common than they were formerly and their absence was perhaps one of the causes of the multitude of failures in the early history of many of our manufactures  such are the principles usually assigned as the causes of the advantage resulting from the division of labour as in the view i have taken of the question the most important and influential cause has been altogether unnoticed i shall restate those principles in the words of adam smith the great increase in the quantity of work which in consequence of the division of labour the same number of people are capable of performing is owing to three different circumstances first to the increase of dexterity in every particular workman; secondly to the saving of time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another; and lastly to the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour and enable one man to do the work of many now although all these are important causes and each has its influence on the result; yet it appears to me that any explanation of the cheapness of manufactured articles as consequent upon the division of labour would be incomplete if the following principle were omitted to be stated that the master manufacturer by dividing the work to be executed into different processes each requiring different degrees of skill or of force can purchase exactly that precise quantity of both which is necessary for each process; whereas if the whole work were executed by one workman that person must possess sufficient skill to perform the most difficult and sufficient strength to execute the most laborious of the operations into which the art is divided  as the clear apprehension of this principle upon which a great part of the economy arising from the division of labour depends is of considerable importance it may be desirable to point out its precise and numerical application in some specific manufacture the art of making needles is perhaps that which i should have selected for this illustration as comprehending a very large number of processes remarkably different in their nature; but the less difficult art of pinmaking has some claim to attention from its having been used by adam smith; and i am confirmed in the choice of it by the circumstance of our possessing a very accurate and minute description of that art as practised in france above half a century ago  pinmaking in the manufacture of pins in england the following processes are employed  wiredrawing a the brass wire used for making pins is purchased by the manufacturer in coils of about twentytwo inches in diameter each weighing about thirtysix pounds b the coils are wound off into smaller ones of about six inches in diameter and between one and two pounds' weight c the diameter of this wire is now reduced by drawing it repeatedly through holes in steel plates until it becomes of the size required for the sort of pins intended to be made during this process the wire is hardened and to prevent its breaking it must be annealed two or three times according to the diminution of diameter required d the coils are then soaked in sulphuric acid largely diluted with water in order to clean them and are then beaten on stone for the purpose of removing any oxidated coating which may adhere to them these operations are usually performed by men who draw and clean from thirty to thirtysix pounds of wire a day they are paid at the rate of five farthings per pound and generally earn about s d per day m perronnet made some experiments on the extension the wire undergoes in passing through each hole he took a piece of thick swedish brass wire and found  feet inches its length to be before drawing  after passing the first hole  second hole  third hole it was now annealed and the length became  after passing the fourth hole  fifth hole  sixth hole  and finally after passing through six other holes the holes through which the wire was drawn were not in this experiment of regularly decreasing diameter it is extremely difficult to make such holes and still more to preserve them in their original dimensions  straightening the wire the coil of wire now passes into the hands of a woman assisted by a boy or girl a few nails or iron pins not quite in a line are fixed into one end of a wooden table about twenty feet in length; the end of the wire is passed alternately between these nails and is then pulled to the other end of the table the object of this process is to straighten the wire which had acquired a considerable curvature in the small coils in which it had been wound the length thus straightened is cut off and the remainder of the coil is drawn into similar lengths about seven nails or pins are employed in straightening the wire and their adjustment is a matter of some nicety it seems that by passing the wire between the first three nails or pins a bend is produced in an opposite direction to that which the wire had in the coil; this bend by passing the next two nails is reduced to another less curved in the first direction and so on till the curve of the wire may at last be confounded with a straight line  pointing a a man next takes about three hundred of these straightened pieces in a parcel and putting them into a gauge cuts off from one end by means of a pair of shears moved by his foot a portion equal in length to rather more than six pins he continues this operation until the entire parcel is reduced into similar pieces b the next step is to sharpen the ends for this purpose the operator sits before a steel mill which is kept rapidly revolving it consists of a cylinder about six inches in diameter and two and a half inches broad faced with steel which is cut in the manner of a file another cylinder is fixed on the same axis at a few inches distant; the file on the edge of which is of a finer kind and is used for finishing off the points the workman now takes up a parcel of the wires between the finger and thumb of each hand and presses the ends obliquely on the mill taking care with his fingers and thumbs to make each wire slowly revolve upon its axis having thus pointed all the pieces at one end he reverses them and performs the same operation on the other this process requires considerable skill but it is not unhealthy; whilst the similar process in needlemaking is remarkably destructive of health c the pieces now pointed at both ends are next placed in gauges and the pointed ends are cut off by means of shears to the proper length of which the pins are to be made the remaining portions of the wire are now equal to about four pins in length and are again pointed at each end and their lengths again cut off this process is repeated a third time and the small portion of wire left in the middle is thrown amongst the waste to be melted along with the dust arising from the sharpening it is usual for a man his wife and a child to join in performing these processes; and they are paid at the rate of five farthings per pound they can point from thirtyfour to thirtysix and a half pounds per day and gain from s d to s which may be apportioned thus; s d the man s the woman d to the boy or girl  twisting and cutting the heads the next process is making the heads for this purpose a a boy takes a piece of wire of the same diameter as the pin to be headed which he fixes on an axis that can be made to revolve rapidly by means of a wheel and strap connected with it this wire is called the mould he then takes a smaller wire which having passed through an eye in a small tool held in his left hand he fixes close to the bottom of the mould the mould is now made to revolve rapidly by means of the right hand and the smaller wire coils round it until it has covered the whole length of the mould the boy now cuts the end of the spiral connected with the foot of the mould and draws it off b when a sufficient quantity of heading is thus made a man takes from thirteen to twenty of these spirals in his left hand between his thumb and three outer fingers these he places in such a manner that two turns of the spiral shall be beyond the upper edge of a pair of shears and with the forefinger of the same hand he feels that only two turns do so project with his right hand he closes the shears; and the two turns of the spiral being cut off drop into a basin; the position of the forefinger preventing the heads from flying about when cut off the workmen who cut the heads are usually paid at the rate of d to d per pound for large heads but a higher price is given for the smaller heading out of this they pay the boy who spins the spiral; he receives from d to d a day a good workman can cut from six to about thirty pounds of heading per day according to its size  heading the process of fixing the head on the body of the pin is usually executed by women and children each operator sits before a small steel stake having a cavity into which one half of the intended head will fit; immediately above is a steel die having a corresponding cavity for the other half of the head this latter die can be raised by a pedal moved by the foot the weight of the hammer is from seven to ten pounds and it falls through a very small space perhaps from one to two inches the cavities in the centre of these dies are connected with the edge of a small groove to admit of the body of the pin which is thus prevented from being flattened by the blow of the die a the operator with his left hand dips the pointed end of the body of a pin into a tray of heads; having passed the point through one of them he carries it along to the other end with the forefinger he now takes the pin in the right hand and places the head in the cavity of the stake and lifting the die with his foot allows it to fall on the head this blow tightens the head on the shank which is then turned round and the head receives three or four blows on different parts of its circumference the women and children who fix the heads are paid at the rate of s d for every twenty thousand a skilful operator can with great exertion do twenty thousand per day but from ten to fifteen thousand is the usual quantity children head a much smaller number varying of course with the degree of their skill about one per cent of the pins are spoiled in the process; these are picked out afterwards by women and are reserved along with the waste from other processes for the meltingpot the die in which the heads are struck is varied in form according to the fashion of the time; but the repeated blows to which it is subject render it necessary that it should be repaired after it has been used for about thirty pounds of pins  tinning the pins are now fit to be tinned a process which is usually executed by a man assisted by his wife or by a lad the quantity of pins operated upon at this stage is usually fiftysix pounds a they are first placed in a pickle in order to remove any grease or dirt from their surface and also to render them rough which facilitates the adherence of the tin with which they are to be covered b they are then placed in a boiler full of a solution of tartar in water in which they are mixed with a quantity of tin in small grains in this they are generally kept boiling for about two hours and a half and are then removed into a tub of water into which some bran has been thrown for the purpose of washing off the acid liquor c they are then taken out and being placed in wooden trays are well shaken in dry bran this removes any water adhering to them; and by giving the wooden tray a peculiar kind of motion the pins are thrown up and the bran gradually flies off and leaves them behind in the tray the man who pickles and tins the pins usually gets one penny per pound for the work and employs himself during the boiling of one batch of pins in drying those previously tinned he can earn about s per day; but out of this he pays about s for his assistant  papering the pins come from the tinner in wooden bowls with the points projecting in all directions the arranging of them side by side in paper is generally performed by women a a woman takes up some and places them on a comb and shaking them some of the pins fall back into the bowl and the rest being caught by their heads are detained between the teeth of the comb b having thus arranged them in a parallel direction she fixes the requisite number between two pieces of iron having twentyfive small grooves at equal distances; c and having previously doubled the paper she presses it against the points of the pins until they have passed through the two folds which are to retain them the pins are then relieved from the grasp of the tool and the process is repeated a woman gains about s d per day by papering; but children are sometimes employed who earn from d per day and upwards  having thus generally described the various processes of pinmaking and having stated the usual cost of each it will be convenient to present a tabular view of the time occupied by each process and its cost as well as the sums which can be earned by the persons who confine themselves solely to each process as the rate of wages is itself fluctuating and as the prices paid and quantities executed have been given only between certain limits it is not to be expected that this table can represent the cost of each part of the work with the minutest accuracy nor even that it shall accord perfectly with the prices above given but it has been drawn up with some care and will be quite sufficient to serve as the basis of those reasonings which it is meant to illustrate a table nearly similar will be subjoined which has been deduced from a statement of m

wheel appears to have arisen from the person so occupied being unemployed during half his time whilst the pointer went to another manufactory  it appears from the analysis we have given of the art of pinmaking that it occupies rather more than seven hours and a half of time for ten different individuals working in succession on the same material to convert it into a pound of pins; and that the total expense of their labour each being paid in the joint ratio of his skill and of the time he is employed amounts very nearly to s d but from an examination of the first of these tables it appears that the wages earned by the persons employed vary from d per day up to s and consequently the skill which is required for their respective employments may be measured by those sums now it is evident that if one person were required to make the whole pound of pins he must have skill enough to earn about s d per day whilst he is pointing the wires or cutting off the heads from the spiral coilsand s when he is whitening the pins; which three operations together would occupy little more than the seventeenth part of his time it is also apparent that during more than one half of his time he must be earning only s d per day in putting on the heads; although his skill if properly employed would in the same time produce nearly five times as much if therefore we were to employ for all the processes the man who whitens the pins and who earns s per day even supposing that he could make the pound of pins in an equally short time yet we must pay him for his time  pence or about s d the pins would therefore cost in making three times and three quarters as much as they now do by the application of the division of labour the higher the skill required of the workman in any one process of a manufacture and the smaller the time during which it is employed so much the greater will be the advantage of separating that process from the rest and devoting one person's attention entirely to it had we selected the art of needlemaking as our illustration the economy arising from the division of labour would have been still more striking; for the process of tempering the needles requires great skill attention and experience and although from three to four thousand are tempered at once the workman is paid a very high rate of wages in another process of the same manufacture drypointing which also is executed with great rapidity the wages earned by the workman reach from s to s s and even in some instances to s per day; whilst other processes are carried on by children paid at the rate of d per day  some further reflections suggested by the preceding analysis will be reserved until we have placed before the reader a brief description of a machine for making pins invented by an american it is highly ingenious in point of contrivance and in respect to its economical principles will furnish a strong and interesting contrast with the manufacture of pins by the human hand in this machine a coil of brass wire is placed on an axis; one end of this wire is drawn by a pair of rollers through a small hole in a plate of steel and is held there by a forceps as soon as the machine is put in action  the forceps draws the wire on to a distance equal in length to one pin a cutting edge of steel then descends close to the hole through which the wire entered and severs the piece drawn out  the forceps holding the piece thus separated moves on till it brings the wire to the centre of the chuck of a small lathe which opens to receive it whilst the forceps is returning to fetch another piece of wire the lathe revolves rapidly and grinds the projecting end of the wire upon a steel mill which advances towards it  after this first or coarse pointing the lathe stops and another forceps takes hold of the halfpointed pin which is instantly released by the opening of the chuck and conveys it to a similar chuck of an adjacent lathe which receives it and finishes the pointing on a finer steel mill  this mill again stops and another forceps removes the pointed pin into a pair of strong steel clams having a small groove in them by which they hold the pin very firmly a part of this groove which terminates at that edge of the steel clams which is intended to form the head of the pin is made conical a small round steel punch is now driven forcibly against the end of the wire thus clamped and the head of the pin is partially formed by compressing the wire into the conical cavity notes  i have already stated that this principle presented itself to me after a personal examination of a number of manufactories and workshops devoted to different purposes; but i have since found that it had been distinctly pointed out in the work of gioja nuovo prospetto delle scienze economiche tom to milano tom i capo iv  the great expense of turning the wheel appears to have arisen from the person so occupied being unemployed during half his time whilst the pointer went to another manufactory  chapter  on the division of labour  we have already mentioned what may perhaps appear paradoxical to some of our readers that the division of labour can be applied with equal success to mental as to mechanical operations and that it ensures in both the same economy of time a short account of its practical application in the most extensive series of calculations ever executed will offer an interesting illustration of this fact whilst at the same time it will afford an occasion for shewing that the arrangements which ought to regulate the interior economy of a manufactory are founded on principles of deeper root than may have been supposed and are capable of being usefully employed in preparing the road to some of the sublimest investigations of the human mind  in the midst of that excitement which accompanied the revolution of france and the succeeding wars the ambition of the nation unexhausted by its fatal passion for military renown was at the same time directed to some of the nobler and more permanent triumphs which mark the era of a people's greatness and which receive the applause of posterity long after their conquests have been wrested from them or even when their existence as a nation may be told only by the page of history amongst their enterprises of science the french government was desirous of producing a series of mathematical tables to facilitate the application of the decimal system which they had so recently adopted they directed therefore their mathematicians to construct such tables on the most extensive scale their most distinguished philosophers responding fully to the call of their country invented new methods for this laborious task; and a work completely answering the large demands of the government was produced in a remarkably short period of time m prony to whom the superintendence of this great undertaking was confided in speaking of its commencement observes je m'y livrai avec toute l'ardeur dont j'etois capable et je m'occupai d'abord du plan general de l'execution toutes les conditions que j'avois a remplir necessitoient l'emploi d'un grand nombre de calculateurs; et il me vint bientot a la pensee d'appliquer a la connection de ces tables la division du travail dont les arts de commerce tirent un parti si avantageux pour reunir a la pernection de maind'oeuvre l'economie de la depense et du temps the circumstance which gave rise to this singular application of the principle of the division on labour is so interesting that no apology is necessary for introducing it from a small pamphlet printed at paris a few years since when a proposition was made by the english to the french government that the two countries should print these tables at their joint expense  the origin of the idea is related in the following extract c'est a un chapitre d'un ouvrage anglais justement celebre i qu'est probablement due l'existence de l'ouvrage dont le gouvernement britannique veut faire jouir le monde savant voici l'anecdote m de prony s'etait engage avec les comites de gouvernement a composer pour la division centesimale du cercle des tables logarithmiques et trigonometriques qui non seulement ne laissassent rien a desirer quant a l'exactitude mais qui formassent le monument de calcul e plus vaste et le plus imposant qui eut jamais ete execute ou meme concu les logarithmes des nombres de a formaient a ce travail un supplement necessaire et exige il fut aise a m de prony de s'assurer que meme en s'associant trois ou quatre habiles cooperateurs la plus grande duree presumable de sa vie ne lui sufirai pas pour remplir ses engagements il etait occupe de cette facheuse pensee lorsque se trouvant devant la boutique d'un marchand de livres il appercut la belle edition anglaise de smith donnee a londres en il ouvrit le livre au hazard et tomba sur le premier chapitre qui traite de la division du travail et ou la fabrication des epingles est citee pour exemple a peine avaitil parcouru les premieres pages que par une espece d'inspiration il concut l'expedient de mettre ses logarithmes en manufacture comme les epingles il faisait en ce moment a l'ecole polytechnique des lecons sur une partie d'analyse liee a ce genre de travail la methode des differences et ses applications a l'interpolation il alla passer quelques jours a la campagne et revint a paris avec le plan de fabrication qui a ete suivi dans l'execution il rassembla deux ateliers qui faisai ent separement les memes calculs et se servaient de verification reciproque  the ancient methods of computing tables were altogether inapplicable to such a proceeding m prony therefore wishing to avail himself of all the talent of his country in devising new methods formed the first section of those who were to take part in this enterprise out of five or six of the most eminent mathematicians in france first section the duty of this first section was to investigate amongst the various analytical expressions which could be found for the same function that which was most readily adapted to simple numerical calculation by many individuals employed at the same time this section had little or nothing to do with the actual numerical work when its labours were concluded the formulae on the use of which it had decided were delivered to the second section second section this section consisted of seven or eight persons of considerable acquaintance with mathematics and their duty was to convert into numbers the formulae put into their hands by the first section an operation of great labour; and then to deliver out these formulae to the members of the third section and receive from them the finished calculations the members of this second section had certain means of verifying the calculations without the necessity of repeating or even of examining the whole of the work done by the third section third section the members of this section whose number varied from sixty to eighty received certain numbers from the second section and using nothing more than simple addition and subtraction they returned to that section the tables in a finished state it is remarkable that ninetenths of this class had no knowledge of arithmetic beyond the two first rules which they were thus called upon to exercise and that these persons were usually found more correct in their calculations than those who possessed a more extensive knowledge of the subject  when it is stated that the tables thus computed occupy seventeen large folio volumes some idea may perhaps be formed of the labour from that part executed by the third class which may almost be termed mechanical requiring the least knowledge and by far the greatest exertions the first class were entirely exempt such labour can always be purchased at an easy rate the duties of the second class although requiring considerable skill in arithmetical operations were yet in some measure relieved by the higher interest naturally felt in those more difficult operations the exertions of the first class are not likely to require upon another occasion so much skill and labour as they did upon the first attempt to introduce such a method; but when the completion of a calculating engine shall have produced a substitute for the whole of the third section of computers the attention of analysts will naturally be directed to simplifying its application by a new discussion of the methods of converting analytical formulae into numbers  the proceeding of m prony in this celebrated system of calculation much resembles that of a skilful person about to construct a cotton or silk mill or any similar establishment having by his own genius or through the aid of his friends found that some improved machinery may be successfully applied to his pursuit he makes drawings of his plans of the machinery and may himself be considered as constituting the first section he next requires the assistance of operative engineers capable of executing the machinery he has designed some of whom should understand the nature of the processes to be carried on; and these constitute his second section when a sufficient number of machines have been made a multitude of other persons possessed of a lower degree of skill must be employed in using them; these form the third section but their work and the just performance of the machines must be still superintended by the second class  as the possibility of performing arithmetical calculations by machinery may appear to nonmathematical readers to be rather too large a postulate and as it is connected with the subject of the division of labour i shall here endeavour in a few lines to give some slight perception of the manner in which this can be doneand thus to remove a small portion of the veil which covers that apparent mystery  that nearly all tables of numbers which follow any law however complicated may be formed to a greater or less extent solely by the proper arrangement of the successive addition and subtraction of numbers befitting each table is a general principle which can be demonstrated to those only who are well acquainted with mathematics; but the mind even of the reader who is but very slightly acquainted with that science will readily conceive that it is not impossible by attending to the following example the subjoined table is the beginning of one in very extensive use which has been printed and reprinted very frequently in many countries and is called a table of square numbers  terms of table a table b first difference c second difference                                                                                any number in the table column a may be obtained by multiplying the number which expresses the distance of that term from the commencement of the table by itself; thus is the fifth term from the beginning of the table and multiplied by itself or by is equal to let us now subtract each term of this table from the next succeeding term and place the results in another column b which may be called first difference column if we again subtract each term of this first difference from the succeeding term we find the result is always the number column c; and that the same number will always recur in that column which may be called the second difference will appear to any person who takes the trouble to carry on the table a few terms further now when once this is admitted it is quite clear that provided the first term of the table the first term of the first differences and the first term of the second or constant difference are originally given we can continue the table of square numbers to any extent merely by addition for the series of first differences may be formed by repeatedly adding the constant difference to the first number in column b and we then have the series of numbers  etc and again by successively adding each of these to the first number of the table we produce the square numbers  having thus i hope thrown some light upon the theoretical part of the question i shall endeavour to shew that the mechanical execution of such an engine as would produce this series of numbers is not so far removed from that of ordinary machinery as might be conceived let the reader imagine three clocks placed on a table side by side each having only one hand and each having a thousand divisions instead of twelve hours marked on the face; and every time a string is pulled let them strike on a bell the numbers of the divisions to which their hands point let him further suppose that two of the clocks for the sake of distinction called b and c have some mechanism by which the clock c advances the hand of the clock b one division for each stroke it makes upon its own bell and let the clock b by a similar contrivance advance the hand of the clock a one division for each stroke it makes on its own bell with such an arrangement having set the hand of the clock a to the division i that of b to iii and that of c to ii let the reader imagine the repeating parts of the clocks to be set in motion continually in the following order vizpull the string of clock a; pull the string of clock b; pull the string of clock c the table on the following page will then express the series of movements and their results if now only those divisions struck or pointed at by the clock a be attended to and written down it will be found that they produce the series of the squares of the natural numbers such a series could of course be carried by this mechanism only so far as the numbers which can be expressed by three figures; but this may be sufficient to give some idea of the constructionand was in fact the point to which the first model of the calculating engine now in progress extended  we have seen then that the effect of the division of labour both in mechanical and in mental operations is that it enables us to purchase and apply to each process precisely that quantity of skill and knowledge which is required for it we avoid employing any part of the time of a man who can get eight or ten shillings a day by his skill in tempering needles in turning a wheel which can be done for sixpence a day; and we equally avoid the loss arising from the employment of an accomplished mathematician in performing the lowest processes of arithmetic  the division of labour cannot be successfully practised unless there exists a great demand for its produce; and it requires a large capital to be employed in those arts in which it is used in watchmaking it has been carried perhaps to the greatest extent it was stated in evidence before a committee of the house of commons that there are a hundred and two distinct branches of this art to each of which a boy may be put apprentice and that he only learns his master's department and is unable after his apprenticeship has expired without subsequent instruction to work at any other branch the watchfinisher whose business is to put together the scattered parts is the only one out of the hundred and two persons who can work in any other department than his own  in one of the most difficult arts that of mining great improvements have resulted from the judicious distribution of the duties; and under the arrangments which have gradually been introduced the whole system of the mine and its government is now placed under the control of the following officers  a manager who has the general knowledge of all that is to be done and who may be assisted by one or more skilful

le gouvernement anglais des grandes tables logarithmiques et trigonometriques de m de prony de l'imprimerie de f didot december  p  since the publication of the second edition of this work one portion of the engine which i have been constructing for some years past has been put together it calculates in three columns a table with its first and second differences each column can be expressed as far as five figures so that these fifteen figures constitute about one ninth part of the larger engine the ease and precision with which it works leave no room to doubt its success in the more extended

manufacture  the great competition introduced by machinery and the application of the principle of the subdivision of labour render it necessary for each producer to be continually on the watch to discover improved methods by which the cost of the article he manufactures may be reduced; and with this view it is of great importance to know the precise expense of every process as well as of the wear and tear of machinery which is due to it the same information is desirable for those by whom the manufactured goods are distributed and sold; because it enables them to give reasonable answers or explanations to the objections of enquirers and also affords them a better chance of suggesting to the manufacturer changes in the fashion of his goods which may be suitable either to the tastes or to the finances of his customers to the statesman such knowledge is still more important; for without it he must trust entirely to others and can form no judgement worthy of confidence of the effect any tax may produce or of the injury the manufacturer or the country may suffer by its imposition  one of the first advantages which suggests itself as likely to arise from a correct analysis of the expense of the several processes of any manufacture is the indication which it would furnish of the course in which improvement should be directed if a method could be contrived of diminishing by one fourth the time required for fixing on the heads of pins the expense of making them would be reduced about thirteen per cent; whilst a reduction of one half the time employed in spinning the coil of wire out of which the heads are cut would scarcely make any sensible difference in the cost of manufacturing of the whole article it is therefore obvious that the attention would be much more advantageously directed to shortening the former than the latter process  the expense of manufacturing in a country where machinery is of the rudest kind and manual labour is very cheap is curiously exhibited in the price of cotton cloth in the island of java the cotton in the seed is sold by the picul which is a weight of about lbs not above one fourth or one fifth of this weight however is cotton the natives by means of rude wooden rollers can only separate about  lb of cotton from the seed by one day's labour a picul of cleansed cotton therefore is worth between four and five times the cost of the impure article; and the prices of the same substance in its different stages of manufacture arefor one picul  dollars cotton in the seed to  clean cotton to  cotton thread  cotton thread dyed blue  good ordinary cotton cloth  thus it appears that the expense of spinning in java is per cent on the value of the raw material; the expense of dying thread blue is per cent on its value; and that of weaving cotton thread into cloth per cent on its value the expense of spinning cotton into a fine thread is in england about per cent  as an example of the cost of the different processes of a manufacture perhaps an analytical statement of the expense of the volume now in the reader's hands may not be uninteresting; more especially as it will afford an insight into the nature and extent of the taxes upon literature it is found economical to print it upon paper of a very large size so that although thirtytwo pages instead of sixteen are really contained in each sheet this work is still called octavo       l s d  to printer for composing per sheet of pages l s  sheets  this relates to the ordinary size of the type used in the volume  to printer for composing small type as in extracts

sundries total expense in sheets cost of a single copy in sheets; being printed including the overplus extra boarding cost of each copy boarded  this analysis requires some explanation the printer usually charges for composition by the sheet supposing the type to be all of one kind; and as this charge is regulated by the size of the letter on which the quantity in a sheet depends little dispute can arise after the price is agreed upon if there are but few extracts or other parts of the work which require to be printed in smaller type; or if there are many notes or several passages in greek or in other languages requiring a different type these are considered in the original contract and a small additional price per sheet allowed if there is a large portion of small type it is better to have a specific additional charge for it per sheet if any work with irregular lines and many figures and what the printers call rules occurs it is called table work and is charged at an advanced price per sheet examples of this are frequent in the present volume if the page consists entirely of figures as in mathematical tables which require very careful correction the charge for composition is usually doubled a few years ago i printed a table of logarithms on a largesized page which required great additional labour and care from the readers in rendering the proofs correct and for which although new punches were not required several new types were prepared and for which stereotype plates were cast costing about l per sheet in this case l per sheet were charged although ordinary composition with the same sized letter in demy octavo could have been executed at thirtyeight shillings per sheet but as the expense was ascertained before commencing the work it gave rise to no difficulties  the charge for corrections and alterations is one which from the difficulty of measuring them gives rise to the greatest inconvenience and is as disagreeable to the publisher if he be the agent between the author and the printer and to the master printer or his foreman as it is to the author himself if the author study economy he should make the whole of his corrections in the manuscript and should copy it out fairly it will then be printed correctly and he will have little to pay for corrections but it is scarcely possible to judge of the effect of any passage correctly without having it set up in type; and there are few subjects upon which an author does not find he can add some details or explanation when he sees his views in print if therefore he wish to save his own labour in transcribing and to give the last polish to the language he must be content to accomplish these objects at an increased expense if the printer possess a sufficient stock of type it will contribute still more to the convenience of the author to have his whole work put up in what are technically called slips and then to make all the corrections and to have as few revises as he can the present work was set up in slips but the corrections have been unusually large and the revises frequent  the press work or printing off is charged at a price agreed upon for each two hundred and fifty sheets; and any broken number is still considered as two hundred and fifty when a large edition is required the price for two hundred and fifty is reduced; thus in the present volume two hundred and fifty copies if printed alone would have been charged eleven shillings per sheet instead of s d the actual charge the principle of this mode of charging is good as it obviates all disputes; but it is to be regretted that the custom of charging the same price for any small number as for two hundred and fifty is so pertinaciously adhered to that the workmen will not agree to any other terms when only twenty or thirty copies are required or even when only three or four are wanted for the sake of some experiment perhaps if all numbers above fifty were charged as two hundred and fifty and all below as for half two hundred and fifty both parties would derive an advantage  the effect of the excise duty is to render the paper thin in order that it may weigh little; but this is counteracted by the desire of the author to make his book look as thick as possible in order that he may charge the public as much as he decently can; and so on that ground alone the duty is of no importance there is however another effect of this duty which both the public and the author feel; for they pay not merely the duty which is charged but also the profit on that duty which the papermaker requires for the use of additional capital; and also the profit to the publisher and bookseller on the increased price of the volume  the estimated charge for advertisements is in the present case about the usual allowance for such a volume; and as it is considered that advertisements in newspapers are the most effectual where the smallest pays a duty of s d nearly one half of the charge of advertising is a tax  it appears then that to an expenditure of l necessary to produce the present volume l are added in the shape of a direct tax whether the profits arising from such a mode of manufacturing will justify such a rate of taxation can only be estimated when the returns from the volume are considered a subject that will be discussed in a subsequent chapter it is at present sufficient to observe that the tax on advertisements is an impolitic tax when contrasted with that upon paper and on other materials employed the object of all advertisements is by making known articles for sale to procure for them a better price if the sale is to be by auction; or a larger extent of sale if by retail dealers now the more any article is known the more quickly it is discovered whether it contributes to the comfort or advantage of the public; and the more quickly its consumption is assured if it be found valuable it would appear then that every tax on communicating information respecting articles which are the subjects of taxation in another shape is one which must reduce the amount that would have been raised had no impediment been placed in the way of making known to the public their qualities and their price notes  these facts are taken from crawford's indian archipelago  these charges refer to the edition prepared for the public and do not relate to the large paper copies in the hands of some of the author's friends  readers are persons employed to correct the press at the printing office  slips are long pieces of paper on which sufficient matter is printed to form when divided from two to four pages of text  chapter chapter  on the causes and consequences of large factories  on examining the analysis which has been given in chapter xix of the operations in the art of pinmaking it will be observed that ten individuals are employed in it and also that the time occupied in executing the several processes is very different in order however to render more simple the reasoning which follows it will be convenient to suppose that each of the seven processes there described requires an equal quantity of time this being supposed it is at once apparent that to conduct an establishment for pinmaking most profitably the number of persons employed must be a multiple of ten for if a person with small means has only sufficient capital to enable him to employ half that number of persons they cannot each of them constantly adhere to the execution of the same process; and if a manufacturer employs any number not a multiple of ten a similar result must ensue with respect to some portion of them the same reflection constantly presents itself on examining any wellarranged factory in that of mr mordan the patentee of the everpointed pencils one room is devoted to some of the processes by which steel pens are manufactured six flypresses are here constantly at work; in the first a sheet of thin steel is brought by the workman under the die which at each blow cuts out a flat piece of the metal having the form intended for the pen two other workmen are employed in placing these flat pieces under two other presses in which a steel chisel cuts the slit three other workmen occupy other presses in which the pieces so prepared receive their semicylindrical form the longer time required for adjusting the small pieces in the two latter operations renders them less rapid in execution than the first; so that two workmen are fully occupied in slitting and three in bending the flat pieces which one man can punch out of the sheet of steel if therefore it were necessary to enlarge this factory it is clear that twelve or eighteen presses would be worked with more economy than any number not a multiple of six the same reasoning extends to every manufacture which is conducted upon the principle of the division of labour and we arrive at this general conclusion when the number of processes into which it is most advantageous to divide it and the number of individuals to be employed in it are ascertained then all factories which do not employ a direct multiple of this latter number will produce the article at a greater cost this principle ought always to be kept in view in great establishments although it is quite impossible even with the best division of the labour to attend to it rigidly in practice the proportionate number of the persons who possess the greatest skill is of course to be first attended to that exact ratio which is more profitable for a factory employing a hundred workmen may not be quite the best where there are five hundred; and the arrangements of both may probably admit of variations without materially increasing the cost of their produce but it is quite certain that no individual nor in the case of pinmaking could any five individuals ever hope to compete with an extensive establishment hence arises one cause of the great size of manufacturing establishments which have increased with the progress of civilization other circumstances however contribute to the same end and arise also from the same cause the division of labour  the material out of which the manufactured article is produced must in the several stages of its progress be conveyed from one operator to the next in succession this can be done at least expense when they are all working in the same establishment if the weight of the material is considerable this reason acts with additional force; but even where it is light the danger arising from frequent removal may render it desirable to have all the processes carried on in the same building in the cutting and polishing of glass this is the case; whilst in the art of needlemaking several of the processes are carried on in the cottages of the workmen it is however clear that the latter plan which is attended with some advantages to the family of the workmen can be adopted only where there exists a sure and quick method of knowing that the work has been well done and that the whole of the materials given out have been really employed  the inducement to contrive machines for any process of manufacture increases with the demand for the article; and the introduction of machinery on the other hand tends to increase the quantity produced and to lead to the establishment of large factories an illustration of these principles may be found in the history of the manufacture of patent net the first machines for weaving this article were very expensive costing from a thousand to twelve or thirteen hundred pounds the possessor of one of these though it greatly increased the quantity he could produce was nevertheless unable when working eight hours a day to compete with the old methods this arose from the large capital invested in the machinery; but he quickly perceived that with the same expense of fixed capital and a small addition to his circulating capital he could work the machine during the whole twentyfour hours the profits thus realized soon induced other persons to direct their attention to the improvement of those machines; and the price was greatly reduced at the same time that the rapidity of production of the patent net was increased but if machines be kept working through the twentyfour hours it is necessary that some person shall attend to admit the workmen at the time they relieve each other; and whether the porter or other servant so employed admit one person or twenty his rest will be equally disturbed it will also be necessary occasionally to adjust or repair the machine; and this can be done much better by a workman accustomed to machinemaking than by the person who uses it now since the good performance and the duration of machines depend to a very great extent upon correcting every shake or imperfection in their parts as soon as they appear the prompt attention of a workman resident on the spot will considerably reduce the expenditure arising from the wear and tear of the machinery but in the case of single lace frame or a single loom this would be too expensive a plan here then arises another circumstance which tends to enlarge the extent of a factory it ought to consist of such a number of machines as shall occupy the whole time of one workman in keeping them in order if extended beyond that number the same principle of economy would point out the necessity of doubling or tripling the number of machines in order to employ the whole time of two or three skilful workmen  where one portion of the workman's labour consists in the exertion of mere physical force as in weaving and in many similar arts it will soon occur to the manufacturer that if that part were executed by a steamengine the same man might in the case of weaving attend to two or more looms at once; and since we already suppose that one or more operative engineers have been employed the number of his looms may be so arranged that their time shall be fully occupied in keeping the steamengine and the looms in order one of the first results will be that the looms can be driven by the engine nearly twice as fast as before and as each man when relieved from bodily labour can attend to two looms one workman can now make almost as much cloth as four this increase of producing power is however greater than that which really took place at first; the velocity of some of the parts of the loom being limited by the strength of the thread and the quickness with which it commences its motion but an improvement was soon made by which the motion commenced slowly and gradually acquired greater velocity than it was safe to give it at once; and the speed was thus increased from to about strokes per minute  pursuing the same principles the manufactory becomes gradually so enlarged that the expense of lighting during the night amounts to a considerable sum; and as there are already attached to the establishment persons who are up all night and can therefore constantly attend to it and also engineers to make and keep in repair any machinery the addition of an apparatus for making gas to light the factory leads to a new extension at the same time that it contributes by diminishing the expense of lighting and the risk of accidents from fire to reduce the cost of manufacturing  long before a factory has reached this extent it will have been found necessary to establish an accountant's department with clerks to pay the workmen and to see that they arrive at their stated times; and this department must be in communication with the agents who purchase the raw produce and with those who sell the manufactured article  we have seen that the application of the division of labour tends to produce cheaper articles; that it thus increases the demand; and gradually by the effect of competition or by the hope of increased gain that it causes large capitals to be embarked in extensive factories let us now examine the influence of this accumulation of capital directed to one object in the first place it enables the most important principle on which the advantages of the division of labour depends to be carried almost to its extreme limits not merely is the precise amount of skill purchased which is necessary for the execution of each process but throughout every stagefrom that in which the raw material is procured to that by which the finished produce is conveyed into the hands of the consumerthe same economy of skill prevails the quantity of work produced by a given number of people is greatly augmented by such an extended arrangement; and the result is necessarily a great reduction in the cost of the article which is brought to market  amongst the causes which tend to the cheap production of any article and which are connected with the employment of additional capital may be mentioned the care which is taken to prevent the absolute waste of any part of the raw material an attention to this circumstance sometimes causes the union of two trades in one factory which otherwise might have been separated an enumeration of the arts to which the horns of cattle are applicable will furnish a striking example of this kind of economy the tanner who has purchased the raw hides separates the horns and sells them to the makers of combs and lanterns the horn consists of two parts an outward horny case and an inward conical substance somewhat intermediate between indurated hair and bone the first process consists in separating these two parts by means of a blow against a block of wood the horny exterior is then cut into three portions with a framesaw  the lowest of these next the root of the horn after undergoing several processes by which it is flattened is made into combs  the middle of the horn after being flattened by heat and having its transparency improved by oil is split into thin layers and forms a substitute for glass in lanterns of the commonest kind  the tip of the horn is used by the makers of knife handles and of the tops of whips and for other similar purposes  the interior or core of the horn is boiled down in water a large quantity of fat rises to the surface; this is put aside and sold to the makers of yellow soap  the liquid itself is used as a kind of glue and is purchased by cloth dressers for stiffening  the insoluble substance which remains behind is then sent to the mill and being ground down is sold to the farmers for manure  besides these various purposes to which the different parts of the horn are applied the clippings which arise in comb making are sold to the farmer for manure in the first year after they are spread over the soil they have comparatively little effect but during the next four or five their efficiency is considerable the shavings which form the refuse of the lantern maker are of a much thinner texture some of them are cut into various figures and painted and used as toys; for being hygrometric they curl up when placed on the palm of a warm hand but the greater part of these shavings also are sold for manure and from their extremely thin and divided form the full effect is produced upon the first crop  another event which has arisen in one trade at least from the employment of large capital is that a class of middlemen formerly interposed between the maker and the merchant now no longer exist when calico was woven in the cottages of the workmen there existed a class of persons who travelled about and purchased the pieces so made in large numbers for the purpose of selling them to the exporting merchant but the middlemen were obliged to examine every piece in order to know that it was perfect and of full measure the greater number of the workmen it is true might be depended upon but the fraud of a few would render this examination indispensable for any single cottager though detected by one purchaser might still hope that the fact would not become known to all the rest the value of character though great in all circumstances of life can never be so fully experienced by persons possessed of small capital as by those employing much larger sums whilst these larger sums of money for which the merchant deals render his character for punctuality more studied and known by others thus it happens that high character supplies the place of an additional portion of capital; and the merchant in dealing with the great manufacturer is saved from the expense of verification by knowing that the loss or even the impeachment of the manufacturer's character would be attended with greater injury to himself than any profit upon a single transaction could compensate  the amount of wellgrounded confidence which exists in the character of its merchants and manufacturers is one of the many advantages that an old manufacturing country always possesses over its rivals to such an extent is this confidence in character carried in england that at one of our largest towns sales and purchases on a very extensive scale are made daily in the course of business without any of the parties ever exchanging a written document  a breach of confidence of this kind which might have been attended with very serious embarrassment occurred in the recent expedition to the mouth of the niger 'we brought with us from england' mr lander states 'nearly a hundred thousand needles of various sizes and amongst them was a great quantity of whitechapel sharps warranted superfine and not to cut in the eye thus highly recommended we imagined that these needles must have been excellent indeed; but what was our surprise some time ago when a number of them which we had disposed of were returned to us with a complaint that they were all eyeless thus redeeming with a vengeance the pledge of the manufacturer that they would not cut in the eye on examination afterwards we found the same fault with the remainder of the whitechapel sharps so that to save our credit we have been obliged to throw them away'  the influence of established character in producing confidence operated in a very remarkable manner at the time of the exclusion of british manufactures from the continent during the last war one of our largest establishments had been in the habit of doing extensive business with a house in the centre of germany; but on the closing of the continental ports against our manufactures heavy penalties were inflicted on all those who contravened the berlin and milan decrees the english manufacturer continued nevertheless to receive orders with directions how to consign them and appointments for the time and mode of payment in letters the handwriting of which was known to him but which were never signed except by the christian name of one of the firm and even in some instances they were without any signature at all these orders were executed; and in no instance was there the least irregularity in the payments  another circumstance may be noticed which to a small extent is more advantageous to large than to small factories in the export of several articles of manufacture a drawback is allowed by government of a portion of the duty paid on the importation of the raw material in such circumstances certain forms must be gone through in order to protect the revenue from fraud; and a clerk or one of the partners must attend at the customhouse the agent of the large establishment occupies nearly the same time in receiving a drawback of several thousands as the smaller exporter does of a few shillings but if the quantity exported is inconsiderable the small manufacturer frequently does not find the drawback will repay him for the loss of time  in many of the large establishments of our manufacturing districts substances are employed which are the produce of remote countries and which are in several instances almost peculiar to a few situations the discovery of any new locality where such articles exist in abundance is a matter of great importance to any establishment which consumes them in large quantities; and it has been found in some instances that the expense of sending persons to great distances purposely to discover and to collect such produce has been amply repaid thus it has happened that the snowy mountains of sweden and norway as well as the warmer hills of corsica have been almost stripped of one of their vegetable productions by agents sent expressly from one of our largest establishments for the dying of calicos owing to the same command of capital and to the scale upon which the operations of large factories are carried on their returns admit of the expense of sending out agents to examine into the wants and tastes of distant countries as well as of trying experiments which although profitable to them would be ruinous to smaller establishments possessing more limited resources these opinions have been so well expressed in the report of the committee of the house of commons on the woollen trade in that we shall close this chapter with an extract in which the advantages of great factories are summed up your committee have the satisfaction of seeing that the apprehensions entertained of factories are not only vicious in principle but they are practically erroneous to such a degree that even the very opposite principles might be reasonably entertained nor would it be difficult to prove that the factories to a certain extent at least and in the present day seem absolutely necessary to the wellbeing of the domestic system supplying those very particulars wherein the domestic system must be acknowledged to be inherently defective for it is obvious that the little master manufacturers cannot afford like the man who possesses considerable capital to try the experiments which are requisite and incur the risks and even losses which almost always occur in inventing and perfecting new articles of manufacture or in carrying to a state of greater perfection articles already established he cannot learn by personal inspection the wants and habits the arts manufactures and improvements of foreign countries; diligence economy and prudence are the requisites of his character not invention taste and enterprise nor would he be warranted in hazarding the loss of any part of his small capital he walks in a sure road as long as he treads in the beaten track; but he must not deviate into the paths of speculation the owner of a factory on the contrary being commonly possessed of a large capital and having all his workmen employed under his own immediate superintendence may make experiments hazard speculation invent shorter or better modes of performing old processes may introduce new articles and improve and perfect old ones thus giving the range to his taste and fancy and thereby alone enabling our manufacturers to stand the competition with their commercial rivals in other countries meanwhile as is well worthy of remark and experience abundantly warrants the assertion many of these new fabrics and inventions when their success is once established become general amongst the whole body of manufacturers the domestic manufacturers themselves thus benefiting in the end from those very factories which had been at first the objects of their jealousy the history of almost all our other manufactures in which great improvements have been made of late years in some cases at an immense expense and after numbers of unsuccessful experiments strikingly illustrates and enforces the above remarks it is besides an acknowledged fact that the owners of factories are often amongst the most extensive purchasers at the halls where they buy from the domestic clothier the established articles of manufacture or are able at once to answer a great and sudden order; whilst at home and under their own superintendence they make their fancy goods and any articles of a newer more costly or more delicate quality to which they are enabled by the domestic system to apply a much larger proportion of their capital thus the two systems instead of rivalling are mutual aids to each other each supplying the other's defects and promoting the other's prosperity notes  lander's journal of an expedition to the mouth of the niger vol ii p chapter  on the position of large factories  it is found in every country that the situation of large manufacturing establishments is confined to particular districts in the earlier history of a manufacturing community before cheap modes of transport have been extensively introduced it will almost always be found that manufactories are placed near those spots in which nature has produced the raw material especially in the case of articles of great weight and in those the value of which depends more upon the material than upon the labour expended on it most of the metallic ores being exceedingly heavy and being mixed up with large quantities of weighty and useless materials must be smelted at no great distance from the spot which affords them fuel and power are the requisites for reducing them; and any considerable fall of water in the vicinity will naturally be resorted to for aid in the coarser exertions of physical force; for pounding the ore for blowing the furnaces or for hammering and rolling out the iron there are indeed peculiar circumstances which will modify this iron coal and limestone commonly occur in the same tracts; but the union of the fuel in the same locality with the ore does not exist with respect to other metals the tracts generally the most productive of metallic ores are geologically speaking different from those affording coal thus in cornwall there are veins of copper and of tin but no beds of coal the copper ore which requires a very large quantity of fuel for its reduction is sent by sea to the coalfields of wales and is smelted at swansea; whilst the vessels which convey it take back coals to work the steamengines for draining the mines and to smelt the tin which requires for that purpose a much smaller quantity of fuel than copper  rivers passing through districts rich in coal and metals will form the first highroads for the conveyance of weighty produce to stations in which other conveniences present themselves for the further application of human skill canals will succeed or lend their aid to these; and the yet unexhausted applications of steam and of gas hold out a hope of attaining almost the same advantages for countries to which nature seemed for ever to have denied them manufactures commerce and civilization always follow the line of new and cheap communications twenty years ago the mississippi poured the vast volume of its waters in lavish profusion through thousands of miles of countries which scarcely supported a few wandering and uncivilized tribes of indians the power of the stream seemed to set at defiance the efforts of man to ascend its course; and as if to render the task still more hopeless large trees torn from the surrounding forests were planted like stakes in its bottom forming in some places barriers in others the nucleus of banks; and accumulating in the same spot which but for accident would have been free from both the difficulties and dangers of shoals and of rocks four months of incessant toil could scarcely convey a small bark with its wornout crew two thousand miles up this stream the same voyage is now performed in fifteen days by large vessels impelled by steam carrying hundreds of passengers enjoying all the comforts and luxuries of civilized life instead of the hut of the indian and the far more unfrequent log house of the thinly scattered settlersvillages towns and cities have arisen on its banks; and the same engine which stems the force of these powerful waters will probably tear from their bottom the obstructions which have hitherto impeded and rendered dangerous their navigation  the accumulation of many large manufacturing establishments in the same district has a tendency to bring together purchasers or their agents from great distances and thus to cause the institution of a public mart or exchange this contributes to diffuse information relative to the supply of raw materials and the state of demand for their produce with which it is necessary manufacturers should be well acquainted the very circumstance of collecting periodically at one place a large number both of those who supply the market and of those who require its produce tends strongly to check the accidental fluctuations to which a small market is always subject as well as to render the average of the prices much more uniform  when capital has been invested in machinery and in buildings for its accommodation and when the inhabitants of the neighbourhood have acquired a knowledge of the modes of working at the machines reasons of considerable weight are required to cause their removal such changes of position do however occur; and they have been alluded to by the committee on the fluctuation of manufacturers' employment as one of the causes interfering most materially with an uniform rate of wages it is therefore of particular importance to the workmen to be acquainted with the real causes which have driven manufactures from their ancient seats the migration or change of place of any manufacture has sometimes arisen from improvements of machinery not applicable to the spot where such manufacture was carried on as appears to have been the case with the woollen manufacture which has in great measure migrated from essex suffolk and other southern counties to the northern districts where coal for the use of the steamengine is much cheaper but this change has in some instances been caused or accelerated by the conduct of the workmen in refusing a reasonable reduction of wages or opposing the introduction of some kind of improved machinery or process; so that during the dispute another spot has in great measure supplied their place in the market any violence used by the workmen against the property of their masters and any unreasonable combination on their part is almost sure thus to be injurious to themselves  these removals become of serious consequence when the factories have been long established because a population commensurate with their wants invariably grows up around them the combinations in nottinghamshire of persons under the name of luddites drove a great number of lace frames from that district and caused establishments to be formed in devonshire we ought also to observe that the effect of driving any establishment into a new district where similar works have not previously existed is not merely to place it out of the reach of such combinations; but after a few years the example of its success will most probably induce other capitalists in the new district to engage in the same manufacture and thus although one establishment only should be driven away the workmen through whose combination its removal is effected will not merely suffer by the loss of that portion of demand for their labour which the factory caused; but the value of that labour will itself be reduced by the competition of a new field of production  another circumstance which has its influence on this question is the nature of the machinery heavy machinery such as stampingmills steamengines etc cannot readily be moved and must always be taken to pieces for that purpose; but when the machinery of a factory consists of a multitude of separate engines each complete in itself and all put in motion by one source of power such as that of steam then the removal is much less inconvenient thus stocking frames lace machines and looms can be transported to more favourable positions with but a small separation of their parts  it is of great importance that the more intelligent amongst the class of workmen should examine into the correctness of these views; because without having their attention directed to them the whole class may in some instances be led by designing persons to pursue a course which although plausible in appearance is in reality at variance with their own best interests i confess i am not without a hope that this volume may fall into the hands of workmen perhaps better qualified than myself to reason upon a subject which requires only plain common sense and whose powers are sharpened by its importance to their personal happiness in asking their attention to the preceding remarks and to those which i shall offer respecting combinations i can claim only one advantage over them; namely that i never have had and in all human probability never shall have the slightest pecuniary interest to influence even remotely or by anticipation the judgements i have formed on the facts which have come before me notes  the amount of obstructions arising from the casual fixing of trees in the bottom of the river may be estimated from the proportion of steamboats destroyed by running upon them the subjoined statement is taken from the american almanack for  between the years and three hundred and fortyeight steamboats were built on the mississippi and its tributary streams during that period a hundred and fifty were lost or worn out of this hundred and fifty worn out       lost by snags      burnt        lost by collision     by accidents not ascertained thirty six or nearly one fourth being destroyed by accidental obstruction snag is the name given in america to trees which stand nearly upright in the stream with their roots fixed at the bottom it is usual to divide off at the bow of the steamboats a watertight chamber in order that when a hole is made in it by running against the snags the water may not enterthe rest of the vessel and sink it intantly  chapter  on over manufacturing  one of the natural and almost inevitable consequences of competition is the production of a supply much larger than the demand requires this result usually arises periodically; and it is equally important both to the masters and to the workmen to prevent its occurrence or to foresee its arrival in situations where a great number of very small capitalists existwhere each master works himself and is assisted by his own family or by a few journeymenand where a variety of different articles is produced a curious system of compensation has arisen which in some measure diminishes the extent to which fluctuations of wages would otherwise reach this is accomplished by a species of middlemen or factors persons possessing some capital who whenever the price of any of the articles in which they deal is greatly reduced purchase it on their own account in the hopes of selling at a profit when the market is better these persons in ordinary times act as salesmen or agents and make up assortments of goods at the market price for the use of the home or foreign dealer they possess large warehouses in which to make up their orders or keep in store articles purchased during periods of depression; thus acting as a kind of flywheel in equalizing the market price  the effect of overmanufacturing upon great establishments is different when an over supply has reduced prices one of two events usually occurs the first is a diminished payment for labour; the other is a diminution of the number of hours during which the labourers work together with a diminished rate of wages in the former case production continues to go on at its ordinary rate in the latter the production itself being checked the supply again adjusts itself to the demand as soon as the stock on hand is worked off and prices then regain their former level the latter course appears in the first instance to be the best both for masters and men; but there seems to be a difficulty in accomplishing this except where the trade is in few hands in fact it is almost necessary for its success that there should be a combination amongst the masters or amongst the men; or what is always far preferable to either a mutual agreement for their joint interests combination amongst the men is difficult and is always attended with the evils which arise from the illwill excited against any persons who in the perfectly justifiable exercise of their judgement are disposed not to act with the majority the combination of the masters on the other hand is unavailing unless the whole body of them agree for if any one master can procure more labour for his money than the rest he will be able to undersell them  if we look only at the interests of the consumer the case is different when too large a supply has produced a great reduction of price it opens the consumption of the article to a new class and increases the consumption of those who previously employed it it is therefore against the interest of both these parties that a return to the former price should occur it is also certain that by the diminution of profit which the manufacturer suffers from the diminished price his ingenuity will be additionally stimulated; that he will apply himself to discover other and cheaper sources for the supply of his raw material; that he will endeavour to contrive improved machinery which shall manufacture it at a cheaper rate; or try to introduce new arrangements into his factory which shall render the economy of it more perfect in the event of his success by any of these courses or by their joint effects a real and substantial good will be produced a larger portion of the public will receive advantage from the use of the article and they will procure it at a lower price; and the manufacturer though his profit on each operation is reduced will yet by the more frequent returns on the larger produce of his factory find his real gain at the end of the year nearly the same as it was before; whilst the wages of the workman will return to their level and both the manufacturer and the workman will find the demand less fluctuating from its being dependent on a larger number of customers  it would be highly interesting if we could trace even approximately through the history of any great manufacture the effects of gluts in producing improvements in machinery or in methods of working; and if we could shew what addition to the annual quantity of goods previously manufactured was produced by each alteration it would probably be found that the increased quantity manufactured by the same capital when worked with the new improvement would produce nearly the same rate of profit as other modes of investment perhaps the manufacture of iron would furnish the best illustration of this subject; because by having the actual price of pig and bar iron at the same place and at the same time the effect of a change in the value of currency as well as several other sources of irregularity would be removed  at the present moment whilst the manufacturers of iron are complaining of the ruinously low price of their produce a new mode of smelting iron is coming into use which if it realizes the statement of the patentees promises to reduce greatly the cost of production the improvement consists in heating the air previously to employing it for blowing the furnace one of the results is that coal may be used instead of coke; and this in its turn diminishes the quantity of limestone which is required for the fusion of the iron stone the following statement by the proprietors of the patent is extracted from brewster's journal p  comparative view of the quantity of materials required at the clyde iron works to smelt a ton of foundry pigiron and of the quantity of foundry pigiron smelted from each furnace weekly fuel in tons of cwt each cwt lbs; ironstone; limestone cwt; weekly produce in pigiron tons  with air not heated and coke; ; ; ;  with air heated and coke; ; ; ;  with air heated and coals not coked; ; ; ;  notes to the coals stated in the second and third lines must be added cwt of small coals required to heat the air  the expense of the apparatus for applying the heated air will be from l to l per furnace  no coals are now coked at the clyde iron works; at all the three furnaces the iron is smelted with coals  the three furnaces are blown by a doublepowered steamengine with a steam cylinder inches in diameter and a blowing cylinder inches in diameter which compresses the air so as to carry  lbs per square inch there are two tuyeres to each furnace the muzzles of the blowpipes are inches in diameter  the air heated to upwards of degrees of fahrenheit it will melt lead at the distance of three inches from the orifice through which it issues from the pipe  the increased effect produced by thus heating the air is by no means an obvious result; and an analysis of its action will lead to some curious views respecting the future application of machinery for blowing furnaces every cubic foot of atmospheric air driven into a furnace consists of two gases about onefifth being oxygen and fourfifths azote according to the present state of chemical knowledge the oxygen alone is effective in producing heat; and the operation of blowing a furnace may be thus analysed  the air is forced into the furnace in a condensed state and immediately expanding abstracts heat from the surrounding bodies  being itself of moderate temperature it would even without expansion still require heat to raise it to the temperature of the hot substances to which it is to be applied  on coming into contact with the ignited substances in the furnace the oxygen unites with them parting at the same moment with a large portion of its latent heat and forming compounds which have less specific heat than their separate constituents some of these pass up the chimney in a gaseous state whilst others remain in the form of melted slags floating on the surface of the iron which is fused by the heat thus set at liberty  the effects of the azote are precisely similar to the first and second of those above described; it seems to form no combinations and contributes nothing in any stage to augment the heat the plan therefore of heating the air before driving it into the furnace saves obviously the whole of that heat which the fuel must have supplied in raising it from the temperature of the external air up to that of degrees fahrenheit; thus rendering the fire more intense and the glassy slags more fusible and perhaps also more effectually decomposing the iron ore the same quantity of fuel applied at once to the furnace would only prolong the duration of its heat not augment its intensity  the circumstance of so large a portion of the air driven into furnaces being not merely useless but acting really as a cooling instead of a heating cause added to so great a waste of mechanical power in condensing it amounting in fact to fourfifths of the whole clearly shews the defects of the present method and the want of some better mode of exciting combustion on a large scale the following suggestions are thrown out as likely to lead to valuable results even though they should prove ineffectual for their professed object  the great difficulty appears to be to separate the oxygen which aids combustion from the azote which impedes it if either of those gases becomes liquid at a lower pressure than the other and if those pressures are within the limits of our present powers of compression the object might be accomplished let us assume for example that oxygen becomes liquid under a pressure of atmospheres whilst azote requires a pressure of then if atmospheric air be condensed to the two hundredth part of its bulk the oxygen will be found in a liquid state at the bottom of the vessel in which the condensation is effected and the upper part of the vessel will contain only azote in the state of gas the oxygen now liquefied may be drawn off for the supply of the furnace; but as it ought when used to have a very moderate degree of condensation its expansive force may be previously employed in working a small engine the compressed azote also in the upper part of the vessel though useless for combustion may be employed as a source of power and by its expansion work another engine by these means the mechanical force exerted in the original compression would all be restored except that small part retained for forcing the pure oxygen into the furnace and the much larger part lost in the friction of the apparatus  the principal difficulty to be apprehended in these operations is that of packing a working piston so as to bear the pressure of or atmospheres but this does not seem insurmountable it is possible also that the chemical combination of the two gases which constitute common air may be effected by such pressures if this should be the case it might offer a new mode of manufacturing nitrous or nitric acids the result of such experiments might take another direction if the condensation were performed over liquids it is possible that they might enter into new chemical combinations thus if air were highly condensed in a vessel containing water the latter might unite with an additional dose of oxygen which might afterwards be easily disengaged for the use of the furnace  a further cause of the uncertainty of the results of such an experiment arises from the possibility that azote may really contribute to the fusion of the mixed mass in the furnace though its mode of operating is at present unknown an examination of the nature of the gases issuing from the chimneys of ironfoundries might perhaps assist in clearing up this point; and in fact if such enquiries were also instituted upon the various products of all furnaces we might expect the elucidation of many points in the economy of the metallurgic art  it is very possible also that the action of oxygen in a liquid state might be exceedingly corrosive and that the containing vessels must be lined with platinum or some other substance of very difficult oxydation; and most probably new and unexpected compounds would be formed at such pressures in some experiments made by count rumford in on the force of fired gunpowder he noticed a solid compound which always appeared in the gunbarrel when the ignited powder had no means of escaping; and in those cases the gas which escaped on removing the restraining pressure was usually inconsiderable  if the liquefied gases are used the form of the iron furnace must probably be changed and perhaps it may be necessary to direct the flame from the ignited fuel upon the ore to be fused instead of mixing that ore with the fuel itself by a proper regulation of the blast an oxygenating or a deoxygenating flame might be procured; and from the intensity of the flame combined with its chemical agency we might expect the most refractory ore to be smelted and that ultimately the metals at present almost infusible such as platinum titanium and others might be brought into common use and thus effect a revolution in the arts  supposing on the occurrence of a glut that new and cheaper modes of producing are not discovered and that the production continues to exceed the demand then it is apparent that too much capital is employed in the trade; and after a time the diminished rate of profit will drive some of the manufacturers to other occupations what particular individuals will leave it must depend on a variety of circumstances superior industry and attention will enable some factories to make a profit rather beyond the rest; superior capital in others will enable them without these advantages to support competition longer even at a loss with the hope of driving the smaller capitalists out of the market and then reimbursing themselves by an advanced price it is however better for all parties that this contest should not last long; and it is important that no artificial restraint should interfere to prevent it an instance of such restriction and of its injurious effect occurs at the port of newcastle where a particular act of parliament requires that every ship shall be loaded in its turn the committee of the house of commons in their report on the coal trade state that  'under the regulations contained in this act if more ships enter into the trade than can be profitablv employed in it the loss produced by detention in port and waiting for a cargo which must consequently take place instead of falling as it naturally would upon particular ships and forcing them from the trade is now divided evenly amongst them; and the loss thus created is shared by the whole number' report p it is not pretended in this short view to trace out all the effects or remedies of overmanufacturing; the subject is difficult and unlike some of the questions already treated requires a combined view of the relative influence of many concurring causes notes  the average price per ton of pig iron bar iron and coal together with the price paid for labour at the works for a long series of years would be very valuable and i shall feel much indebted to anyone who will favour me with it for any even short period  the accurate proportions are by measure oxygen azote  a similar reasoning may be applied to lamps an argand burner whether used for consuming oil or gas admits almost an unlimited quantity of air it would deserve enquiry whether a smaller quantity might not produce greater light; and possibly a different supply furnish more heat with the same expenditure of fuel  deutoxide of hydrogen the oxygenated water of thenard  chapter  enquiries previous to commencing any manufactory  there are many enquiries which ought always to be made previous to the commencement of the manufacture of any new article these chiefly relate to the expense of tools machinery raw materials and all the outgoings necessary for its production; to the extent of demand which is likely to arise; to the time in which the circulating capital will be replaced; and to the quickness or slowness with which the new article will supersede those already in use  the expense of tools and of new machines will be more difficult to ascertain in proportion as they differ from those already employed; but the variety in constant use in our various manufactories is such that few inventions now occur in which considerable resemblance may not be traced to others already constructed the cost of the raw material is usually less difficult to determine; but cases occasionally arise in which it becomes important to examine whether the supply at the given price can be depended upon for in the case of a small consumption the additional demand arising from a factory may produce a considerable temporary rise though it may ultimately reduce the price  the quantity of any new article likely to be consumed is a most important subject for the consideration of the projector of a new manufacture as these pages are not intended for the instruction of the manufacturer but rather for the purpose of giving a general view of the subject an illustration of the way in which such questions are regarded by practical men will perhaps be most instructive the following extract from the evidence given before a committee of the house of commons in the report on artizans and machinery shews the extent to which articles apparently the most insignificant are consumed and the view which the manufacturer takes of them the person examined on this occasion was mr ostler a manufacturer of glass beads and other toys of the same substance from birmingham several of the articles made by him were placed upon the table for the inspection of the committee of the house of commons which held its meetings in one of the committeerooms question is there any thing else you have to state upon this subject? answer gentlemen may consider the articles on the table as extremely insignificant but perhaps i may surprise them a little by mentioning the following fact eighteen years ago on my first journey to london a respectablelooking man in the city asked me if i could supply him with dolls' eyes; and i was foolish enough to feel half offended; i thought it derogatory to my new dignity as a manufacturer to make dolls' eyes he took me into a room quite as wide and perhaps twice the length of this and we had just room to walk between stacks from the loor to the ceiling of parts of dolls he said 'these are only the legs and arms; the trunks are below but i saw enough to convince me that he wanted a great many eyes; and as the article appeared quite in my own line of business i said i would take an order by way of experiment; and he shewed me several specimens i copied the order he ordered various quantities and of various sizes and qualities on returning to the tavistock hotel i found that the order amounted to upwards of l i went into the country and endeavoured to make them i had some of the most ingenious glass toymakers in the kingdom in my service; but when i shewed it to them they shook their heads and said they had often seen the article before but could not make it i engaged them by presents to use their best exertions; but after trying and wasting a great deal of time for three or four weeks i was obliged to relinquish the attempt soon afterwards i engaged in another branch of business chandelier furniture and took no more notice of it about eighteen months ago i resumed the trinket trade and then determined to think of the dolls' eyes; and about eight months since i accidentally met with a poor fellow who had impoverished himself by drinking and who was dying in a consumption in a state of great want i showed him ten sovereigns and he said he would instruct me in the process he was in such a state that he could not bear the effluvia of his own lamp but though i was very conversant with the manual part of the business and it related to things i was daily in the habit of seeing i felt i could do nothing from his description i mention this to show how difficult it is to convey by description the mode of working he took me into his garret where the poor fellow had economized to such a degree that he actually used the entrails and fat of poultry from leadenhall market to save oil the price of the article having been lately so much reduced by competition at home in an instant before i had seen him make three i felt competent to make a gross; and the difference between his mode and that of my own workmen was so trifling that i felt the utmost astonishment question you can now make dolls' eyes? answer i can as it was eighteen years ago that i received the order i have mentioned and feeling doubtful of my own recollection though very strong and suspecting that it could not have been to the amount stated i last night took the present very reduced price of that article less than half now of what it was then and calculating that every child in this country not using a doll till two years old and throwing it aside at seven and having a new one annually i satisfied myself that the eyes alone would produce a circulation of a great many thousand pounds i mention this merely to shew the importance of trifles; and to assign one reason amongst many for my conviction that nothing but personal communication can enable our manufactures to be transplanted  in many instances it is exceedingly difficult to estimate beforehand the sale of an article or the effects of a machine; a case however occurred during a recent enquiry which although not quite appropriate as an illustration of probable demand is highly instructive as to the mode of conducting investigations of this nature a committee of the house of commons was appointed to enquire into the tolls proper to be placed on steamcarriages; a question apparently of difficult solution and upon which widely different opinions had been formed if we may judge by the very different rate of tolls imposed upon such carriages by different 'turnpike trusts' the principles on which the committee conducted the enquiry were that 'the only ground on which a fair claim to toll can be made on any public road is to raise a fund which with the strictest economy shall be just sufficientfirst to repay the expense of its original formation; secondly to maintain it in good and sufficient repair' they first endeavoured to ascertain from competent persons the effect of the atmosphere alone in deteriorating a wellconstructed road the next step was to determine the proportion in which the road was injured by the effect of the horses' feet compared with that of the wheels mr macneill the superintendent under mr telford of the holyhead roads was examined and proposed to estimate the relative injury from the comparative quantities of iron worn off from the shoes of the horses and from the tire of the wheels from the data he possessed respecting the consumption of iron for the tire of the wheels and for the shoes of the horses of one of the birmingham daycoaches he estimated the wear and tear of roads arising from the feet of the horses to be three times as great as that arising from the wheels supposing repairs amounting to a hundred pounds to be required on a road travelled over by a fast coach at the rate of ten miles an hour and the same amount of injury to occur on another road used only by waggons moving at the rate of three miles an hour mr macneill divides the injuries in the following proportions  injuries arising from; fast coach; heavy waggon atmospheric changes    wheels       horses' feet drawing    total injury     supposing it therefore to be ascertained that the wheels of steam carriages do no more injury to roads than other carriages of equal weight travelling with the same velocity the committee now possessed the means of approximating to a just rate of toll for steam carriages  as connected with this subject and as affording most valuable information upon points in which previous to experiment widely different opinions have been entertained; the following extract is inserted from mr telford's report on the state of the holyhead and liverpool roads the instrument employed for the comparison was invented by mr macneill; and the road between london and shrewsbury was selected for the place of experiment the general results when a waggon weighing cwt was used on different sorts of roads are as follows       lbs on wellmade pavement the draught is  on a broken stone surface or old flint road  on a gravel road  on a broken stone road upon a rough pavement foundation  on a broken stone surface upon a bottoming of concrete formed of parker's cement and gravel  the following statement relates to the force required to draw a coach weighing cwt exclusive of seven passengers up roads of various inclinations inclination; force required at six miles per hour; force at eight miles per hour; force at ten miles per hour   lbs lbs lbs  in   in   in   in   in   in establishing a new manufactory the time in which the goods produced can be brought to market and the returns be realized should be thoroughly considered as well as the time the new article will take to supersede those already in use if it is destroyed in using the new produce will be much more easily introduced steel pens readily took the place of quills; and a new form of pen would if it possessed any advantage as easily supersede the present one a new lock however secure and however cheap would not so readily make its way if less expensive than the old it would be employed in new work but old locks would rarely be removed to make way for it; and even if perfectly secure its advance would be slow  another element in this question which should not be altogether omitted is the opposition which the new manufacture may create by its real or apparent injury to other interests and the probable effect of that opposition this is not always foreseen; and when anticipated is often inaccurately estimated on the first establishment of steamboats from london to margate the proprietors of the coaches running on that line of road petitioned the house of commons against them as likely to lead to the ruin of the coach proprietors it was however found that the fear was imaginary; and in a very few years the number of coaches on that road was considerably increased apparently through the very means which were thought to be adverse to it the fear which is now entertained that steampower and railroads may drive out of employment a large proportion of the horses at present in use is probably not less unfounded on some particular lines such an effect might be produced; but in all probability the number of horses employed in conveying goods and passengers to the great lines of railroad would exceed that which is at present used notes  one of the results of these enquiries is that every coach which travels from london to birmingham distributes about eleven pounds of wrought iron along with the line of road between the two places  chapter  on a new system of manufacturing  a most erroneous and unfortunate opinion prevails amongst workmen in many manufacturing countries that their own interest and that of their employers are at variance the consequences are that valuable machinery is sometimes neglected and even privately injuredthat new improvements introduced by the masters do not receive a fair trialand that the talents and observations of the workmen are not directed to the improvement of the processes in which they are employed this error is perhaps most prevalent where the establishment of manufactories has been of recent origin and where the number of persons employed in them is not very large thus in some of the prussian provinces on the rhine it prevails to a much greater extent than in lancashire perhaps its diminished prevalence in our own manufacturing districts arises partly from the superior information spread amongst the workmen; and partly from the frequent example of persons who by good conduct and an attention to the interests of their employers for a series of years have become foremen or who have ultimately been admitted into advantageous partnerships convinced as i am from my own observation that the prosperity and success of the master manufacturer is essential to the welfare of the workman i am yet compelled to admit that this connection is in many cases too remote to be always understood by the latter and whilst it is perfectly true that workmen as a class derive advantage from the prosperity of their employers i do not think that each individual partakes of that advantage exactly in proportion to the extent to which he contributes towards it; nor do i perceive that the resulting advantage is as immediate as it might become under a different system  it would be of great importance if in every large establishment the mode of payment could be so arranged that every person employed should derive advantage from the success of the whole; and that the profits of each individual should advance as the factory itself produced profit without the necessity of making any change in the wages this is by no means easy to effect particularly amongst that class whose daily labour procures for them their daily food the system which has long been pursued in working the cornish mines although not exactly fulfilling these conditions yet possesses advantages which make it worthy of attention as having nearly approached towards them and as tending to render fully effective the faculties of all who are engaged in it i am the more strongly induced to place before the reader a short sketch of this system because its similarity to that which i shall afterwards recommend for trial will perhaps remove some objections to the latter and may also furnish some valuable hints for conducting any experiment which might be undertaken  in the mines of cornwall almost the whole of the operations both above and below ground are contracted for the manner of making the contract is nearly as follows at the end of every two months the work which it is proposed to carry on during the next period is marked out it is of three kinds tutwork which consists in sinking shafts driving levels and making excavations this is paid for by the fathom in depth or in length or by the cubic fathom tribute which is payment for raising and dressing the ore by means of a certain part of its value when rendered merchantable it is this mode of payment which produces such admirable effects the miners who are to be paid in proportion to the richness of the vein and the quantity of metal extracted from it naturally become quicksighted in the discovery of ore and in estimating its value; and it is their interest to avail themselves of every improvement that can bring it more cheaply to market dressing the 'tributors' who dig and dress the ore can seldom afford to dress the coarser parts of what they raise at their contract price; this portion therefore is again let out to other persons who agree to dress it at an advanced price the lots of ore to be dressed and the works to be carried on having been marked out some days before and having been examined by the men a kind of auction is held by the captains of the mine in which each lot is put up and bid for by different gangs of men the work is then offered at a price usually below that bid at the auction to the lowest bidder who rarely declines it at the rate proposed the tribute is a certain sum out of every twenty shillings' worth of ore raised and may vary from threepence to fourteen or fifteen shillings the rate of earnings in tribute is very uncertain if a vein which was poor when taken becomes rich the men earn money rapidly; and instances have occurred in which each miner of a gang has gained a hundred pounds in the two months these extraordinary cases are perhaps of more advantage to the owners of the mine than even to the men; for whilst the skill and industry of the workmen are greatly stimulated the owner himself always derives still greater advantage from the improvement of the vein this system has been introduced by mr taylor into the lead mines of flintshire into those at skipton in yorkshire and into some of the copper mines of cumberland; and it is desirable that it should become general because no other mode of payment affords to the workmen a measure of success so directly proportioned to the industry the integrity and the talent which they exert  i shall now present the outline of a system which appears to me to be pregnant with the most important results both to the class of workmen and to the country at large; and which if acted upon would in my opinion permanently raise the working classes and greatly extend the manufacturing system the general principles on which the proposed system is founded are  that a considerable part of the wages received by each person employed should depend on the profits made by the establishment; and  that every person connected with it should derive more advantage from applying any improvement he might discover to the factory in which he is employed than he could by any other course  it would be difficult to prevail on the large capitalist to enter upon any system which would change the division of the profits arising from the employment of his capital in setting skill and labour in action; any alteration therefore must be expected rather from the small capitalist or from the higher class of workmen who combine the two characters; and to these latter classes whose welfare will be first affected the change is most important i shall therefore first point out the course to be pursued in making the experiment; and then taking a particular branch of trade as an illustration i shall examine the merits and defects of the proposed system as applied to it  let us suppose in some large manufacturing town ten or twelve of the most intelligent and skilful workmen to unite whose characters for sobriety and steadiness are good and are well known among their own class such persons will each possess some small portion of capital; and let them join with one or two others who have raised themselves into the class of small master manufacturers and therefore possess rather a larger portion of capital let these persons after well considering the subject agree to establish a manufactory of fireirons and fenders; and let us suppose that each of the ten workmen can command forty pounds and each of the small capitalists possesses two hundred pounds thus they have a capital of l with which to commence business; and for the sake of simplifying let us further suppose the labour of each of these twelve persons to be worth two pounds a week one portion of their capital will be expended in procuring the tools necessary for their trade which we shall take at l and this must be considered as their fixed capital the remaining l must be employed as circulating capital in purchasing the iron with which their articles are made in paying the rent of their workshops and in supporting themselves and their families until some portion of it is replaced by the sale of the goods produced  now the first question to be settled is what proportion of the profit should be allowed for the use of capital and what for skill and labour? it does not seem possible to decide this question by any abstract reasoning if the capital supplied by each partner is equal all difficulty will be removed; if otherwise the proportion must be left to find its level and will be discovered by experience; and it is probable that it will not fluctuate much let us suppose it to be agreed that the capital of l shall receive the wages of one workman at the end of each week every workman is to receive one pound as wages and one pound is to be divided amongst the owners of the capital after a few weeks the returns will begin to come in; and they will soon become nearly uniform accurate accounts should be kept of every expense and of all the sales; and at the end of each week the profit should be divided a certain portion should be laid aside as a reserved fund another portion for repair of the tools and the remainder being divided into thirteen parts one of these parts would be divided amongst the capitalists and one belong to each workman thus each man would in ordinary circumstances make up his usual wages of two pounds weekly if the factory went on prosperously the wages of the men would increase; if the sales fell off they would be diminished it is important that every person employed in the establishment whatever might be the amount paid for his services whether he act as labourer or porter as the clerk who keeps the accounts or as bookkeeper employed for a few hours once a week to superintend them should receive one half of what his service is worth in fixed salary the other part varying with the success of the undertaking  in such a factory of course division of labour would be introduced some of the workmen would be constantly employed in forging the fireirons others in polishing them others in piercing and forming the fenders it would be essential that the time occupied in each process and also its expense should be well ascertained; information which would soon be obtained very precisely now if a workman should find a mode of shortening any of the processes he would confer a benefit on the whole party even if they received but a small part of the resulting profit for the promotion of such discoveries it would be desirable that those who make them should either receive some reward to be determined after a sufficient trial by a committee assembling periodically; or if they be of high importance that the discoverer should receive onehalf or twothirds of the profit resulting from them during the next year or some other determinate period as might be found expedient as the advantages of such improvements would be clear gain to the factory it is obvious that such a share might be allowed to the inventor that it would be for his interest rather to give the benefit of them to his partners than to dispose of them in any other way  the result of such arrangements in a factory would be  that every person engaged in it would have a direct interest in its prosperity; since the effect of any success or falling off would almost immediately produce a corresponding change in his own weekly receipts  every person concerned in the factory would have an immediate interest in preventing any waste or mismanagement in all the departments  the talents of all connected with it would be strongly directed to its improvement in every department  none but workmen of high character and qualifications could obtain admission into such establishments; because when any additional hands were required it would be the common interest of all to admit only the most respectable and skilful; and it would be far less easy to impose upon a dozen workmen than upon the single proprietor of a factory  when any circumstance produced a glut in the market more skill would be directed to diminishing the cost of production; and a portion of the time of the men might then be occupied in repairing and improving their tools for which a reserved fund would pay thus checking present and at the same time facilitating future production  another advantage of no small importance would be the total removal of all real or imaginary causes for combinations the workmen and the capitalist would so shade into each other would so evidently have a common interest and their difficulties and distresses would be mutually so well understood that instead of combining to oppress one another the only combination which could exist would be a most powerful union between both parties to overcome their common difficulties  one of the difficulties attending such a system is that capitalists would at first fear to embark in it imagining that the workmen would receive too large a share of the profits and it is quite true that the workmen would have a larger share than at present but at the same time it is presumed the effect of the whole system would be that the total profits of the establishment being much increased the smaller proportion allowed to capital under this system would yet be greater in actual amount than that which results to it from the larger share in the system now existing  it is possible that the present laws relating to partnerships might interfere with factories so conducted if this interference could not be obviated by confining their purchases under the proposed system to ready money it would be desirable to consider what changes in the law would be necessary to its existence and this furnishes another reason for entering into the question of limited partnerships  a difficulty would occur also in discharging workmen who behaved ill or who were not competent to their work; this would arise from their having a certain interest in the reserved fund and perhaps from their possessing a certain portion of the capital employed; but without entering into detail it may be observed that such cases might be determined on by meetings of the whole establishment; and that if the policy of the laws favoured such establishments it would scarcely be more difficult to enforce just regulations than it now is to enforce some which are unjust by means of combinations either amongst the masters or the men  some approach to this system is already practised in several trades the mode of conducting the cornish mines has already been alluded to; the payment to the crew of whaling ships is governed by this principle; the profits arising from fishing with nets on the south coast of england are thus divided onehalf the produce belongs to the owner of the boat and net; the other half is divided in equal portions between the persons using it who are also bound to assist in repairing the net when injured notes  for a detailed account of the method of working the cornish mines see a paper of mr john taylor's transactions of the geological society vol ii p chapter  on contriving machinery  the power of inventing mechanical contrivances and of combining machinery does not appear if we may judge from the frequency of its occurrence to be a difficult or a rare gift of the vast multitude of inventions which have been produced almost daily for a series of years a large part has failed from the imperfect nature of the first trials; whilst a still larger portion which had escaped the mechanical difficulties failed only because the economy of their operations was not sufficiently attended to the commissioners appointed to examine into the methods proposed for preventing the forgery of banknotes state in their report that out of one hundred and seventyeight projects communicated to the bank and to the commissioners there were only twelve of superior skill and nine which it was necessary more particularly to examine  it is however a curious circumstance that although the power of combining machinery is so common yet the more beautiful combinations are exceedingly rare those which command our admiration equally by the perfection of their effects and the simplicity of their means are found only amongst the happiest productions of genius to produce movements even of a complicated kind is not difficult there exist a great multitude of known contrivances for all the more usual purposes and if the exertion of moderate power is the end of the mechanism to be contrived it is possible to construct the whole machine upon paper and to judge of the proper strength to be given to each part as well as to the framework which supports it and also of its ultimate effect long before a single part of it has been executed in fact all the contrivance and all the improvements ought first to be represented in the drawings  on the other hand there are effects dependent upon physical or chemical properties for the determination of which no drawings will be of any use these are the legitimate objects of direct trial for example; if the ultimate result of an engine is to be that it shall impress letters on a copperplate by means of steel punches forced into it all the mechanism by which the punches and the copper are to be moved at stated intervals and brought into contact is within the province of drawing and the machinery may be arranged entirely upon paper but a doubt may reasonably spring up whether the bur that will be raised round the letter which has been already punched upon the copper may not interfere with the proper action of the punch for the letter which is to be punched next adjacent to it it may also be feared that the effect of punching the second letter if it be sufficiently near to the first may distort the form of that first figure if neither of these evils should arise still the bur produced by the punching might be expected to interfere with the goodness of the impression produced by the copperplate; and the plate itself after having all but its edge covered with figures might change its form from the unequal condensation which it must suffer in this process so as to render it very difficult to take impressions from it at all it is impossible by any drawings to solve difficulties such as these experiment alone can determine their effect such experiments having been made it is found that if the sides of the steel punch are nearly at right angles to the face of the letter the bur produced is very inconsiderable; that at the depth which is sufficient for copperplate printing no distortion of the adjacent letters takes place although those letters are placed very close to each other; that the small bur which arises may easily be scraped off; and that the copperplate is not distorted by the condensation of the metal in punching but is perfectly fit to print from after it has undergone that process  the next stage in the progress of an invention after the drawings are finished and the preliminary experiments have been made if any such should be requisite is the execution of the machine itself it can never be too strongly impressed upon the minds of those who are devising new machines that to make the most perfect drawings of every part tends essentially both to the success of the trial and to economy in arriving at the result the actual execution from working drawings is comparatively an easy task; provided always that good tools are employed and that methods of working are adopted in which the perfection of the part constructed depends less on the personal skill of the workman than upon the certainty of the method employed  the causes of failure in this stage most frequently derive their origin from errors in the preceding one; and it is sufficient merely to indicate a few of their sources they frequently arise from having neglected to take into consideration that metals are not perfectly rigid but elastic a steel cylinder of small diameter must not be regarded as an inflexible rod; but in order to ensure its perfect action as an axis it must be supported at proper intervals again the strength and stiffness of the framing which supports the mechanism must be carefully attended to it should always be recollected that the addition of superfluous matter to the immovable parts of a machine produces no additional momentum and therefore is not accompanied with the same evil that arises when the moving parts are increased in weight the stiffness of the framing in a machine produces an important advantage if the bearings of the axis those places at which they are supported are once placed in a straight line they will remain so if the framing be immovable; whereas if the framework changes its form though ever so slightly considerable friction is immediately produced this effect is so well understood in the districts where spinning factories are numerous that in estimating the expense of working a new factory it is allowed that five per cent on the power of the steamengine will be saved if the building is fireproof for the greater strength and rigidity of a fireproof building prevents the movement of the long shafts or axes which drive the machinery from being impeded by the friction that would arise from the slightest deviation in any of the bearings  in conducting experiments upon machinery it is quite a mistake to suppose that any imperfect mechanical work is good enough for such a purpose if the experiment is worth making it ought to be tried with all the advantages of which the state of mechanical art admits; for an imperfect trial may cause an idea to be given up which better workmanship might have proved to be practicable on the other hand when once the efficiency of a contrivance has been established with good workmanship it will be easy afterwards to ascertain the degree of perfection which will suffice for its due action  it is partly owing to the imperfection of the original trials and partly to the gradual improvements in the art of making machinery that many inventions which have been tried and given up in one state of art have at another period been eminently successful the idea of printing by means of moveable types had probably suggested itself to the imagination of many persons conversant with impressions taken either from blocks or seals we find amongst the instruments discovered in the remains of pompeii and herculaneum stamps for words formed out of one piece of metal and including several letters the idea of separating these letters and of recombining them into other words for the purpose of stamping a book could scarcely have failed to occur to many but it would almost certainly have been rejected by those best acquainted with the mechanical arts of that time; for the workmen of those days must have instantly perceived the impossibility of producing many thousand pieces of wood or metal fitting so perfectly and ranging so uniformly as the types or blocks of wood now used in the art of printing the principle of the press which bears the name of bramah was known about a century and a half before the machine to which it gave rise existed; but the imperfect state of mechanical art in the time of the discoverer would have effectually deterred him if the application of it had occurred to his mind from attempting to employ it in practice as an instrument for exerting force these considerations prove the propriety of repeating at the termination of intervals during which the art of making machinery has received any great improvement the trails of methods which although founded upon just principles had previously failed  when the drawings of a machine have been properly made and the parts have been well executed and even when the work it produces possesses all the qualities which were anticipated still the invention may fail; that is it may fail of being brought into general practice this will most frequently arise from the circumstance of its producing its work at a greater expense than that at which it can be made by other methods  whenever the new or improved machine is intended to become the basis of a manufacture it is essentially requisite that the whole expense attending its operations should be fully considered before its construction is undertaken it is almost always very difficult to make this estimate of the expense the more complicated the mechanism the less easy is the task; and in cases of great complexity and extent of machinery it is almost impossible it has been estimated roughly that the first individual of any newly invented machine will cost about five times as much as the construction of the second an estimate which is perhaps sufficiently near the truth if the second machine is to be precisely like the first the same drawings and the same patterns will answer for it; but if as usually happens some improvements have been suggested by the experience of the first these must be more or less altered when however two or three machines have been completed and many more are wanted they can usually be produced at much less than onefifth of the expense of the original invention  the arts of contriving of drawing and of executing do not usually reside in their greatest perfection in one individual; and in this as in other arts the division of labour must be applied the best advice which can be offered to a projector of any mechanical invention is to employ a respectable draughtsman; who if he has had a large experience in his profession will assist in finding out whether the contrivance is new and can then make working drawings of it the first step however the ascertaining whether the contrivance has the merit of novelty is most important; for it is a maxim equally just in all the arts and in every science that the man who aspires to fortune or to fame by new discoveries must be content to examine with care the knowledge of his contemporaries or to exhaust his efforts in inventing again what he will most probably find has been better executed before  this nevertheless is a subject upon which even ingenious men are often singularly negligent there is perhaps no trade or profession existing in which there is so much quackery so much ignorance of the scientific principles and of the history of their own art with respect to its resources and extent as are to be met with amongst mechanical projectors the selfconstituted engineer dazzled with the beauty of some perhaps really original contrivance assumes his new profession with as little suspicion that previous instruction that thought and painful labour are necessary to its successful exercise as does the statesman or the senator much of this false confidence arises from the improper estimate which is entertained of the difficulty of invention in mechanics it is therefore of great importance to the individuals and to the families of those who are too often led away from more suitable pursuits the dupes of their own ingenuity and of the popular voice to convince both them and the public that the power of making new mechanical combinations is a possession common to a multitude of minds and that the talents which it requires are by no means of the highest order it is still more important that they should be impressed with the conviction that the great merit and the great success of those who have attained to eminence in such matters was almost entirely due to the unremitted perseverance with which they concentrated upon their successful inventions the skill and knowledge which years of study had matured  chapter  proper circumstances for the application of machinery  the first object of machinery the chief cause of its extensive utility is the perfection and the cheap production of the articles which it is intended to make whenever it is required to produce a great multitude of things all of exactly the same kind the proper time has arrived for the construction of tools or machines by which they may be manufactured if only a few pairs of cotton stockings should be required it would be an absurd waste of time and of capital to construct a stockingframe to weave them when for a few pence four steel wires can be procured by which they may be knit if on the other hand many thousand pairs were wanted the time employed and the expense incurred in constructing a stockingframe would be more than repaid by the saving of time in making that large number of stockings the same principle is applicable to the copying of letters if three or four copies only are required the pen and the human hand furnish the cheapest means of obtaining them; if hundreds are called for lithography may be brought to our assistance; but if hundreds of thousands are wanted the machinery of a printing establishment supplies the most economical method of accomplishing the object  there are however many cases in which machines or tools must be made in which economical production is not the most important object whenever it is required to produce a few articles parts of machinery for instance which must be executed with the most rigid accuracy or be perfectly alikeit is nearly impossible to fulfil this condition even with the aid of the most skilful hands and it becomes necessary to make tools expressly for the purpose although those tools should as frequently happens cost more in constructing than the things they are destined to make  another instance of the just application of machinery even at an increased expense arises where the shortness of time in which the article is produced has an important influence on its value in the publication of our daily newspapers it frequently happens that the debates in the houses of parliament are carried on to three and four o'clock in the morning that is to within a very few hours of the time for the publication of the paper the speeches must be taken down by reporters conveyed by them to the establishment of the newspaper perhaps at the distance of one or two miles transcribed by them in the office set up by the compositor the press corrected and the paper be printed off and distributed before the public can read them some of these journals have a circulation of from five to ten thousand daily supposing four thousand to be wanted and that they could be printed only at the rate of five hundred per hour upon one side of the paper which was the greatest number two journeymen and a boy could take off by the old hand presses sixteen hours would be required for printing the complete edition; and the news conveyed to the purchasers of the latest portion of the impression would be out of date before they could receive it to obviate this difficulty it was often necessary to set up the paper in duplicate and sometimes when late in triplicate but the improvements in the printing machines have been so great that four thousand copies are now printed on one side in an hour  the establishment of 'the times' newspaper is an example on a large scale of a manufactory in which the division of labour both mental and bodily is admirably illustrated and in which also the effect of domestic economy is well exemplified it is scarcely imagined by the thousands who read that paper in various quarters of the globe what a scene of organized activity the factory presents during the whole night or what a quantity of talent and mechanical skill is put in action for their amusement and information nearly a hundred persons are employed in this establishment; and during the session of parliament at least twelve reporters are constantly attending the houses of commons and lords; each in his turn retiring after about an hour's work to translate into ordinary writing the speech he has just heard and noted in shorthand in the meantime fifty compositors are constantly at work some of whom have already set up the beginning whilst others are committing to type the yet undried manuscript of the continuation of a speech whose middle portion is travelling to the office in the pocket of the hasty reporter and whose eloquent conclusion is perhaps at that very moment making the walls of st stephen's vibrate with the applause of its hearers these congregated types as fast as they are composed are passed in portions to other hands; till at last the scattered fragments of the debate forming when united with the ordinary matter eightandforty columns reappear in regular order on the platform of the printingpress the hand of man is now too slow for the demands of his curiosity but the power of steam comes to his assistance ink is rapidly supplied to the moving types by the most perfect mechanism; four attendants incessantly introduce the edges of large sheets of white paper to the junction of two great rollers which seem to devour them with unsated appetite; other rollers convey them to the type already inked and having brought them into rapid and successive contact redeliver them to four other assistants completely printed by the almost momentary touch thus in one hour four thousand sheets of paper are printed on one side; and an impression of twelve thousand copies from above three hundred thousand moveable pieces of metal is produced for the public in six hours  the effect of machinery in printing other periodical publications and of due economy in distributing them is so important for the interests of knowledge that it is worth examining by what means it is possible to produce them at the small price at which they are sold 'chambers' journal' which is published at edinburgh and sold at three halfpence a number will furnish an example soon after its commencement in the sale in scotland reached and in order to supply the demand in london it was reprinted; but on account of the expense of 'composition' it was found that this plan would not produce any profit and the london edition was about to be given up when it occurred to the proprietor to stereotype it at edinburgh and cast two copies of the plates this is now done about three weeks before the day of publicationone set of plates being sent up to london by the mail an impression is printed off by steam the london agent has then time to send packages by the cheapest conveyances to several of the large towns and other copies go through the booksellers' parcels to all the smaller towns thus a great saving is effected in the outlay of capital and copies are conveyed from london as a centre to all parts of england whilst there is no difficulty in completing imperfect sets nor any waste from printing more than the public demand  the conveyance of letters is another case in which the importance of saving time would allow of great expense in any new machinery for its accomplishment there is a natural limit to the speed of horses which even the greatest improvements in the breed aided by an increased perfection in our roads can never surpass; and from which perhaps we are at present not very remote when we reflect upon the great expense of time and money which the last refinements of a theory or an art usually require it is not unreasonable to suppose that the period has arrived in which the substitution of machinery for such purposes ought to be tried  the post bag despatched every evening by the mail to one of our largest cities bristol usually weighs less than a hundred pounds now the first reflection which naturally presents itself is that in order to transport these letters a hundred and twenty miles a coach and apparatus weighing above thirty hundredweight are put in motion and also conveyed over the same space  it is obvious that amongst the conditions of machinery for accomplishing such an object it would be desirable to reduce the weight of matter to be conveyed along with the letters it would also be desirable to reduce the velocity of the animal power employed; because the faster a horse is driven the less weight he can draw amongst the variety of contrivances which might be imagined for this purpose we will mention one which although by no means free from objections fulfils some of the prescribed conditions; and it is not a purely theoretical speculation since some few experiments have been made upon it though on an extremely limited scale  let us imagine a series of high pillars erected at frequent intervals perhaps every hundred feet and as nearly as possible in a straight line between two post towns an iron or steel wire must be stretched over proper supports fixed on each of these pillars and terminating at the end of every three or five miles as may be found expedient in a very strong support by which it may be stretched at each of these latter points a man ought to reside in a small stationhouse a narrow cylindrical tin case to contain the letters might be suspended by two wheels rolling upon this wire; the cases being so constructed as to enable the wheels to pass unimpeded by the fixed supports of the wire an endless wire of much smaller size must pass over two drums one at each end of the station this wire should be supported on rollers fixed to the supports of the great wire and at a short distance below it there would thus be two branches of the smaller wire always accompanying the larger one; and the attendant at either station by turning the drum might cause them to move with great velocity in opposite directions in order to convey the cylinder which contains the letters it would only be necessary to attach it by a string or by a catch to either of the branches of the endless wire thus it would be conveyed speedily to the next station where it would be removed by the attendant to the commencement of the next wire and so forwarded it is unnecessary to enter into the details which this or any similar plan would require the difficulties are obvious; but if these could be overcome it would present many advantages besides velocity; for if an attendant resided at each station the additional expense of having two or three deliveries of letters every day and even of sending expresses at any moment would be comparatively trifling; nor is it impossible that the stretched wire might itself be available for a species of telegraphic communication yet more rapid perhaps if the steeples of churches properly selected were made use of connecting them by a few intermediate stations with some great central building as for instance with the top of st paul's; and if a similar apparatus were placed on the top of each steeple with a man to work it during the day it might be possible to diminish the expense of the twopenny post and make deliveries every half hour over the greater part of the metropolis  the power of steam however bids fair almost to rival the velocity of these contrivances; and the fitness of its application to the purposes of conveyance particularly where great rapidity is required begins now to be generally admitted the following extract from the report of the committee of the house of commons on steamcarriages explains clearly its various advantages perhaps one of the principal advantages resulting from the use of steam will be that it may be employed as cheaply at a quick as at a slow rate; 'this is one of the advantages over horse labour which becomes more and more expensive as the speed is increased there is every reason to expect that in the end the rate of travelling by steam will be much quicker than the utmost speed of travelling by horses; in short the safety to travellers will become the limit to speed' in horsedraught the opposite result takes place; 'in all cases horses lose power of draught in a much greater proportion than they gain speed and hence the work they do becomes more expensive as they go quicker' without increase of cost then we shall obtain a power which will insure a rapidity of internal communication far beyond the utmost speed of horses in draught; and although the performance of these carriages may not have hitherto attained this point when once it has been established that at equal speed we can use steam more cheaply in draught than horses we may fairly anticipate that every day's increased experience in the management of the engines will induce greater skill greater confidence and greater speed the cheapness of the conveyance will probably be for some time a secondary consideration if at present it can be used as cheaply as horse power the competition with the former modes of conveyance will first take place as to speed when once the superiority of steamcarriages shall have been fully established competition will induce economy in the cost of working them the evidence however of mr macneill shewing the greater efficiency with diminished expenditure of fuel by locomotive engines on railways convinces the committee that experience will soon teach a better construction of the engines and a less costly mode of generating the requisite supply of steam nor are the advantages of steampower confined to the greater velocity attained or to its greater cheapness than horsedraught in the latter danger is increased in as large a proportion as expense by greater speed in steampower on the contrary 'there is no danger of being run away with and that of being overturned is greatly diminished it is difficult to control four such horses as can draw a heavy carriage ten miles per hour in case they are frightened or choose to run away; and for quick travelling they must be kept in that state of courage that they are always inclined for running away particularly down hills and at sharp turns of the road in steam however there is little corresponding danger being perfectly controllable and capable of exerting its power in reverse in going down hills every witness examined has given the fullest and most satisfactory evidence of the perfect control which the conductor has over the movement of the carriage with the slightest exertion it can be stopped or turned under circumstances where horses would be totally unmanageable  another instance may be mentioned in which the object to be obtained is so important that although it might be rarely wanted yet machinery for that purpose would justify considerable expense a vessel to contain men and to be navigated at some distance below the surface of the sea would in many circumstances be almost invaluable such a vessel evidently could not be propelled by any engine requiring the aid of fire if however by condensing air into a liquid and carrying it in that state a propelling power could be procured sufficient for moving the vessel through a considerable space the expense would scarcely render its occasional employment impossible  slide of alpnach amongst the forests which flank many of the lofty mountains of switzerland some of the finest timber is found in positions almost inaccessible the expense of roads even if it were possible to make them in such situations would prevent the inhabitants from deriving any advantages from these almost inexhaustible supplies placed by nature at a considerable elevation above the spot at which they can be made use of they are precisely in fit circumstances for the application of machinery to their removal; and the inhabitants avail themselves of the force of gravity to relieve them from some portion of this labour the inclined planes which they have established in various forests by which the timber has been sent down to the water courses have excited the admiration of every traveller; and in addition to the merit of simplicity the construction these slides requires scarcely anything beyond the material which grows upon the spot of all these specimens of carpentry the slide of alpnach was the most considerable from its great length and from the almost inaccessible position from which it descended the following account of it is taken from gilbert's annalen which is translated in the second volume of brewster's journal for many centuries the rugged flanks and the deep gorges of mount pilatus were covered with impenetrable forests; which were permitted to grow and to perish without being of the least utility to man till a foreigner who had been conducted into their wild recesses in the pursuit of the chamois directed the attention of several swiss gentlemen to the extent and superiority of the timber the most skilful individuals however considered it quite impracticable to avail themselves of such inaccessible stores it was not till the end of that m rupp and three swiss gentlemen entertaining more sanguine hopes purchased a certain extent of the forests and began the construction of the slide which was completed in the spring of  the slide of alpnach is formed entirely of about large pine trees deprived of their bark and united together in a very ingenious manner without the aid of iron it occupied about workmen during eighteen months and cost nearly francs or l it is about three leagues or english feet long and terminates in the lake of lucerne it has the form of a trough about six feet broad and from three to six feet deep its bottom is formed of three trees the middle one of which has a groove cut out in the direction of its length for receiving small rills of water which are conducted into it from various places for the purpose of diminishing the friction the whole of the slide is sustained by about supports; and in many places it is attached in a very ingenious manner to the rugged precipices of granite the direction of the slide is sometimes straight and sometimes zigzag with an inclination of from degrees to degrees it is often carried along the sides of hills and the flanks of precipitous rocks and sometimes passes over their summits occasionally it goes under ground and at other times it is conducted over the deep gorges by scaffoldings feet in height the boldness which characterizes this work the sagacity and skill displayed in all its arrangements have excited the wonder of every person who has seen it before any step could be taken in its erection it was necessary to cut several thousand trees to obtain a passage through the impenetrable thickets all these difficulties however were surmounted and the engineer had at last the satisfaction of seeing the trees descend from the mountain with the rapidity of lightning the larger pines which were about a hundred feet long and ten inches thick at their smaller extremity ran through the space of three leagues or nearly nine miles in two minutes and a half and during their descent they appeared to be only a few feet in length the arrangements for this part of the operation were extremely simple from the lower end of the slide to the upper end where the trees were introduced workmen were posted at regular distances and as soon as everything was ready the workman at the lower end of the slide cried out to the one above him 'lachez' let go the cry was repeated from one to another and reached the top of the slide in three minutes the workmen at the top of the slide then cried out to the one below him 'il vient' it comes and the tree was instantly launched down the slide preceded by the cry which was repeated from post to post as soon as the tree had reached the bottom and plunged into the lake the cry of lachez was repeated as before and a new tree was launched in a similar manner by these means a tree descended every five or six minutes provided no accident happened to the slide which sometimes took place but which was instantly repaired when it did in order to shew the enormous force which the trees acquired from the great velocity of their descent m rupp made arrangements for causing some of the trees to spring from the slide they penetrated by their thickest extremities no less than from eighteen to twentyfour feet into the earth; and one of the trees having by accident struck against another it instantly cleft it through its whole length as if it had been struck by lightning after the trees had descended the slide they were collected into rafts upon the lake and conducted to lucerne from thence they descended the reuss then the aar to near brugg afterwards to waldshut by the rhine then to basle and even to the sea when it was necessary it is to be regretted that this magnificent structure no longer exists and that scarcely a trace of it is to be seen upon the flanks of mount pilatus political circumstances having taken away the principal source of demand for the timber and no other market having been found the operation of cutting and transporting the trees necessarily ceased professor playfair who visited this singular work states that six minutes was the usual time occupied in the descent of a tree; but that in wet weather it reached the lake in three minutes notes  the author of these pages with one of his friends was recently induced to visit this most interesting establishment after midnight during the progress of a very important debate the place was illuminated with gas and was light as the day there was neither noise nor bustle; and the visitors were received with such calm and polite attention that they did not until afterwards become sensible of the inconvenience which such intruders at a moment of the greatest pressure must occasion nor reflect tha the tranquility which they admired was the result of intense and regulated occupation but the effect of such checks in the current of business will appear on recollecting that as four thousand newspapers are printed off on one side within the hour every minute is attended with a loss of sixtysix impressions the quarter of an hour therefore which the stranger may think it not unreasonable to claim for the gratification of his curiosity and to him this time is but a moment may cause a failure in the delivery of a thousand copies and disappoint a proportionate number of expectant readers in some of our distant towns to which the morning papers are dispatched by the earliest and most rapid conveyances of each day this note is inserted with the further and more general purpose of calling the attention of those especially foreigners who are desirous of inspecting our larger manufactories to the chief cause of the difficulty which frequently attends their introduction when the establishment is very extensive and its departments skilfully arranged the exclusion of visitors arises not from any illiberal jealousy nor generally from any desire of concealment which would in most cases be absurd but from the substantial inconvenience and loss of time throughout an entire series of wellcombined operations which must be occasioned even by short and causual interruptions  it is true that the transport of letters is not the only object which this apparatus answers; but the transport of passengers which is a secondary object does in fact put a limit to the velocity of that of the letters which is the primary one  a proposal for such a vessel and description of its construction by the author of this volume may be found in the encyclopaedia metropolitana art diving bell  the mines of bolanos in mexico are supplied with timber from the adjacent mountains by a slide similar to that of alpnach it was constructed by m floresi a gentleman well acquainted with switzerland  chapter  on the duration of machinery  the time during which a machine will continue to perform its work effectually will depend chiefly upon the perfection with which it was originally constructed upon the care taken to keep it in proper repair particularly to correct every shake or looseness in the axesand upon the smallness of the mass and of the velocity of its moving parts everything approaching to a blow all sudden change of direction is injurious engines for producing power such as windmills watermills and steamengines usually last a long time  many of the improvements which have taken place in steamengines have arisen from an improved construction of the boiler or the fireplace the following table of the work done by steamengines in cornwall whilst it proves the importance of constantly measuring the effects of machinery shows also the gradual advance which has been made in the art of constructing and managing those engines  a table of the duty performed by steamengines in cornwall shewing the average of the whole for each year and also the average duty of the best engine in each monthly report years; approximate number of engines reported; average duty of the whole; average duty of the best engines  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ;

which there are several engines find it good economy to employ a man to measure the duty they perform every day this daily report is fixed up at a particular hour and the enginemen are always in waiting anxious to know the state of their engines as the general reports are made monthly if accident should cause a partial stoppage in the flue of any of the boilers it might without this daily check continue two or three weeks before it could be discovered by a falling off of the duty of the engine in several of the mines a certain amount of duty is assigned to each engine; and if it does more the proprietors give a premium to the engineers according to its amount this is called million money and is a great stimulus to economy in working the engine  machinery for producing any commodity in great demand seldom actually wears out; new improvements by which the same operations can be executed either more quickly or better generally superseding it long before that period arrives indeed to make such an improved machine profitable it is usually reckoned that in five years it ought to have paid itself and in ten to be superseded by a better 'a cotton manufacturer' says one of the witnesses before a committee of the house of commons 'who left manchester seven years ago would be driven out of the market by the men who are now living in it provided his knowledge had not kept pace with those who have been during that time constantly profiting by the progressive improvements that have taken place in that period'  the effect of improvements in machinery seems incidentally to increase production through a cause which may be thus explained a manufacturer making the usual profit upon his capital invested in looms or other machines in perfect condition the market price of making each of which is a hundred pounds invents some improvement but this is of such a nature that it cannot be adapted to his present engines he finds upon calculation that at the rate at which he can dispose of his manufactured produce each new engine would repay the cost of its making together with the ordinary profit of capital in three years he also concludes from his experience of the trade that the improvement he is about to make will not be generally adopted by other manufacturers before that time on these considerations it is clearly his interest to sell his present engines even at halfprice and construct new ones on the improved principle but the purchaser who gives only fifty pounds for the old engines has not so large a fixed capital invested in his factory as the person from whom he purchased them; and as he produces the same quantity of the manufactured article his profits will be larger hence the price of the commodity will fall not only in consequence of the cheaper production by the new machines but also by the more profitable working of the old thus purchased at a reduced price this change however can be only transient; for a time will arrive when the old machinery although in good repair must become worthless the improvement which took place not long ago in frames for making patentnet was so great that a machine in good repair which had cost l sold a few years after for l during the great speculations in that trade the improvements succeeded each other so rapidly that machines which had never been finished were abandoned in the hands of their makers because new improvements had superseded their utility  the durability of watches when well made is very remarkable one was produced in going order before a committee of the house of commons to enquire into the watch trade which was made in the year ; and there are many of ancient date in the possession of the clockmaker's company which are still actually kept going the number of watches manufactured for home consumption was in the year about annually if this supply was for great britain only it was consumed by about ten and a half millions of persons  machines are in some trades let out to hire and a certain sum is paid for their use; in the manner of rent this is the case amongst the framework knitters and mr henson in speaking of the rate of payment for the use of their frames states that the proprietor receives such a rent that besides paying the full interest for his capital he clears the value of his frame in nine years when the rapidity with which improvements succeed each other is considered this rent does not appear exorbitant some of these frames have been worked for thirteen years with little or no repair but circumstances occasionally arise which throw them out of employment either temporarily or permanently some years since an article was introduced called cutup work by which the price of stockingframes was greatly deteriorated from the evidence of mr j rawson it appears that in consequence of this change in the nature of the work each frame could do the work of two and many stocking frames were thrown out of employment and their value reduced full threefourths this information is of great importance if the numbers here given are nearly correct and if no other causes intervened to diminish the price of frames; for it shews the numerical connection between the increased production of those machines and their diminished value  the great importance of simplifying all transactions between masters and workmen and of dispassionately discussing with the latter the influence of any proposed regulations connected with their trade is well examplified by a mistake into which both parties unintentionally fell and which was productive of very great misery in the lace trade its history is so well told by william allen a framework knitter who was a party to it that an extract from his evidence as given before the framework knitters' committee of will best explain it i beg to say a few words respecting the frame rent; the rent paid for lace frames until the year was s d a frame per week; there then was not any very great inducement for persons to buy frames and let them out by the hire who did not belong to the trade; at that time an attempt was made by one or two houses to reduce the prices paid to the workmen in consequence of a dispute between these two houses and another great house some little difference being paid in the price amongst the respective houses i was one chosen by the workmen to try if we could not remedy the impending evil we consulted the respective parties and found them inflexible; these two houses that were about to reduce the prices said that they would either immediately reduce the price of making net or they would increase the frame rent the difference to the workmen was considerable between the one and the other; they would suffer less in the immediate operation of the thing by having the rent advanced than the price of making net reduced they chose at that time as they thought the lesser evil but it has turned out to be otherwise; for immediately as the rent was raised upon the percentage laid out in frames it induced almost every person who had got a little money to lay it out in the purchase of frames; these frames were placed in the hands of men who could get work for them at the warehouses; they were generally constrained to pay an enormous rent and then they were compelled most likely to buy of the persons that let them the frames their butcher's meat their grocery or their clothing the encumbrance of these frames became entailed upon them if any deadness took place in the work they must take it at a very reduced price for fear of the consequences that would fall upon them from the person who bought the frame thus the evil has been daily increasing till in conjunction with the other evils crept into the trade they have almost crushed it to atoms  the evil of not assigning fairly to each tool or each article produced its proportionate value or even of not having a perfectly distinct simple and definite agreement between a master and his workmen is very considerable workmen find it difficult in such cases to know the probable produce of their labour; and both parties are often led to adopt arrangements which had they been well examined would have been rejected as equally at variance in the results with the true interests of both  at birmingham stamps and dies and presses for a great variety of articles are let out they are generally made by men possessing small capital and are rented by workmen power also is rented at the same place steamengines are erected in large buildings containing a variety of rooms in which each person may hire one two or any other amount of horsepower as his occupation may require if any mode could be discovered of transmitting power without much loss from friction to considerable distances and at the same time of registering the quantity made use of at any particular point a considerable change would probably take place in many departments of the present system of manufacturing a few central engines to produce power might then be erected in our great towns and each workman hiring a quantity of power sufficient for his purpose might have it conveyed into his own house; and thus a transition might in some instances be effected if it should be found more profitable back again from the system of great factories to that of domestic manufacture  the transmission of water through a series of pipes might be employed for the distribution of power but the friction would consume a considerable portion another method has been employed in some instances and is practised at the mint it consists in exhausting the air from a large vessel by means of a steamengine this vessel is connected by pipes with a small piston which drives each coining press; and on opening a valve the pressure of the external air forces in the piston this air is then admitted to the general reservoir and pumped out by the engine the condensation of air might be employed for the same purpose; but there are some unexplained facts relating to elastic fluids which require further observations and experiment before they can be used for the conveyance of power to any considerable distance it has been found for instance in attempting to blow a furnace by means of a powerful waterwheel driving air through a castiron pipe of above a mile in length that scarcely any sensible effect was produced at the opposite extremity in one instance some accidental obstruction being suspected a cat put in at one end found its way out without injury at the other thus proving that the phenomenon did not depend on interruption within the pipe  the most portable form in which power can be condensed is perhaps by the liquefaction of the gases it is known that under considerable pressure several of these become liquid at ordinary temperatures; carbonic acid for example is reduced to a liquid state by a pressure of sixty atmospheres one of the advantages attending the use of these fluids would be that the pressure exerted by them would remain constant until the last drop of liquid had assumed the form of gas if either of the elements of common air should be found to be capable of reduction to a liquid state before it unites into a corrosive fluid with the other ingredient then we shall possess a ready means of conveying power in any quantity and to any distance hydrogen probably will require the strongest compressing force to render it liquid and may therefore possibly be applied where still greater condensation of power is wanted in all these cases the condensed gases may be looked upon as springs of enormous force which have been wound up by the exertion of power and which will deliver the whole of it back again when required these springs of nature differ in some respects from the steel springs formed by our art; for in the compression of the natural springs a vast quantity of latent heat is forced out and in their return to the state of gas an equal quantity is absorbed may not this very property be employed with advantage in their application? part of the mechanical difficulty to be overcome in constructing apparatus connected with liquefied gases will consist in the structure of the valves and packing necessary to retain the fluids under the great pressure to which they must be submitted the effect of heat on these gases has not yet been sufficiently tried to lead us to any very precise notions of the additional power which its application to them will supply the elasticity of air is sometimes employed as a spring instead of steel in one of the large printingmachines in london the momentum of a considerable mass of matter is destroyed by making it condense the air included in a cylinder by means of a piston against which it impinges  the effect of competition in cheapening articles of manufacture sometimes operates in rendering them less durable when such articles are conveyed to a distance for consumption if they are broken it often happens from the price of labour being higher where they are used than where they were made that it is more expensive to mend the old article than to purchase a new such is usually the case in great cities with some of the commoner locks with hinges and with a variety of articles of hardware notes  the amount of obstructions arising from the casual fixing of trees in the bottom of the river may be estimated from the proportion of steamboats destroyed by running upon them the subjoined statement is taken from the american almanack for  'between the years and three hundred and fortyeight steamboats were built on the mississippi and its tributary streams during that period a hundred and fifty were lost or worn out 'of this hundred and fifty   worn out     lost by snags    burnt      lost by collision   by accidents   not ascertained thirtysix or nearly one fourth being destroyed by accidental obstructions snag is the name given in america to trees which stand nearly upright in the stream with their roots fixed at the bottom it is usual to divide off at the bow of the steamboats a watertight chamber in order that when a hole is made in it by running against the snags the water may not enter the rest of the vessel and sink it instantly  this passage is not printed in italics in the original but it has been thus marked in the above extract from its importance and from the conviction that the most extended discussion will afford additional evidence of its truth  report from the committee of the house of commons on the framework knitter's petition april chapter  on combinations amongst masters or workmen against each other  there exist amongst the workmen of almost all classes certain rules or laws which govern their actions towards each other and towards their employers but besides these general principles there are frequently others peculiar to each factory which have derived their origin in many instances from the mutual convenience of the parties engaged in them such rules are little known except to those actually pursuing the several trades; and as it is of importance that their advantages and disadvantages should be canvassed we shall offer a few remarks upon some of them  the principles by which such laws should be tried are first that they conduce to the general benefit of all the persons employed secondly that they prevent fraud thirdly that they interfere as little as possible with the free agency of each individual  it is usual in many workshops that on the first entrance of a new journeyman he shall pay a small fine to the rest of the men it is clearly unjust to insist upon this payment; and when it is spent in drinking which is unfortunately too often the case it is injurious the reason assigned for the demand is that the newcomer will require some instruction in the habits of the shop and in the places of the different tools and will thus waste the time of some of his companions until he is instructed if this fine were added to a fund managed by the workmen themselves and either divided at given periods or reserved for their relief in sickness it would be less objectionable since its tendency would be to check the too frequent change of men from one shop to another but it ought at all events not to be compulsory and the advantages to be derived from the fund to which the workman is invited to subscribe ought to be his sole inducement to contribute  in many workshops the workmen although employed on totally different parts of the objects manufactured are yet dependent in some measure upon each other thus a single smith may be able to forge in one day work enough to keep four or five turners employed during the next if from idleness or intemperance the smith neglects his work and does not furnish the usual supply the turners supposing them to be paid by the piece will have their time partly unoccupied and their gains consequently diminished it is reasonable in such circumstances that a fine should be levied on the delinquent; but it is desirable that the master should have concurred with his workmen in establishing such a rule and that it should be shown to each individual previously to his engagement; and it is very desirable that such fine should not be spent in drinking  in some establishments it is customary for the master to give a small gratuity whenever any workman has exercised a remarkable degree of skill or has economized the material employed thus in splitting horn into layers for lanterns one horn usually furnishes from five to eight layers; but if a workman split the horn into ten layers or more he receives a pint of ale from the master these premiums should not be too high lest the material should be wasted in unsuccessful attempts but such regulations when judiciously made are beneficial as they tend to produce skill amongst the workmen profit to the masters and diminished cost to the consumers  in some few factories in which the men are paid by the piece it is usual when any portion of work delivered in by a workman is rejected by the master on account of its being badly executed to fine the delinquent such a practice tends to remedy one of the evils attendant upon that mode of payment and greatly assists the master since his own judgement is thus supported by competent and unprejudiced judges  societies exist amongst some of the larger bodies of workmen and others have been formed by the masters engaged in the same branches of trade these associations have different objects in view; but it is very desirable that their effects should be well understood by the individuals who compose them; and that the advantages arising from them which are certainly great should be separated as much as possible from the evils which they have unfortunately too frequently introduced associations of workmen and of masters may with advantage agree upon rules to be observed by both parties in estimating the proportionate value of different kinds of work executed in their trade in order that time may be saved and disputes be prevented they may also be most usefully employed in acquiring accurate information as to the number of persons working in the various departments of any manufacture their rate of wages the number of machines in use and other statistical details information of this nature is highly valuable both for the guidance of the parties who are themselves most interested and to enable them upon any application to government for assistance or with a view to legislative enactments to supply those details without which the propriety of any proposed measure cannot be duly estimated such details may be collected by men actually engaged in any branch of trade at a much smaller expense of time than by persons less acquainted with and less interested in it  one of the most legitimate and most important objects of such associations as we have just mentioned is to agree upon ready and certain modes of measuring the quantity of work done by the workmen for a long time a difficulty upon this point existed in the lace trade which was justly complained of by the men as a serious grievance; but the introduction of the rack which counts the number of holes in the length of the piece has entirely put an end to the most fertile cause of disputes this invention was adverted to by the committee of and a hope was expressed in their report that the same contrivance would be applied to stockingframes it would indeed be of great mutual advantage to the industrious workman and to the master manufacturer in every trade if the machines employed in it could register the quantity of work which they perform in the same manner as a steamengine does the number of strokes it makes the introduction of such contrivances gives a greater stimulus to honest industry than can readily be imagined and removes one of the sources of disagreement between parties whose real interests must always suffer by any estrangement between them  the effects arising from combinations amongst the workmen are almost always injurious to the parties themselves there are numerous instances in which the public suffer by increased price at the moment but are ultimately gainers from the permanent reduction which results; whilst on the other hand the improvements which are often made in machinery in consequence of 'a strike' amongst the workmen most frequently do injury of greater or less duration to that particular class which gave rise to them as the injury to the men and to their families is almost always more serious than that which affects their employers it is of the utmost importance to the comfort and happiness of the former class that they should themselves entertain sound views upon this question for this purpose a few illustrations of the principle which is here maintained will probably have greater weight than any reasoning of a more general nature though drawn from admitted principles of political economy such instances will moreover present the advantage of appealing to facts known to many individuals of those classes for whose benefit these reflections are intended  there is a process in the manufacture of gun barrels for making what in the language of the trade are called skelps the skelp is a piece or bar of iron about three feet long and four inches wide but thicker and broader at one end than at the other; and the barrel of a musket is formed by forging out such pieces to the proper dimensions and then folding or bending them into a cylindrical form until the edges overlap so that they can be welded together about twenty years ago the workmen employed at a very extensive factory in forging these skelps out of bariron 'struck' for an advance of wages; and as their demands were very exorbitant they were not immediately complied with in the meantime the superintendent of the establishment directed his attention to the subject; and it occurred to him that if the circumference of the rollers between which the bariron was rolled were to be made equal to the length of a skelp or of a musket barrel and if also the groove in which the iron was compressed instead of being of the same width and depth throughout were cut gradually deeper and wider from a point on the rollers until it returned to the same point then the bariron passing between such rollers instead of being uniform in width and thickness would have the form of a skelp on making the trial it was found to succeed perfectly; a great reduction of human labour was effected by the process and the workmen who had acquired peculiar skill in performing it ceased to derive any advantage from their dexterity  it is somewhat singular that another and a still more remarkable instance of the effect of combination amongst workmen should have occurred but a few years since in the very same trade the process of welding the skelps so as to convert them into gun barrels required much skill and after the termination of the war the demand for muskets having greatly diminished the number of persons employed in making them was very much reduced this circumstance rendered combination more easy; and upon one occasion when a contract had been entered into for a considerable supply to be delivered on a fixed day the men all struck for such an advance of wages as would have caused the completion of the contract to be attended with a very heavy loss in this difficulty the contractors resorted to a mode of welding the gun barrel for which a patent had been taken out by one of themselves some years before this event the plan had not then succeeded so well as to come into general use in consequence of the cheapness of the usual mode of welding by hand labour combined with some other difficulties with which the patentee had to contend but the stimulus produced by the combination of the workmen induced him to make new trials and he was enabled to introduce such a facility in welding gun barrels by rollers and such perfection in the work itself that in all probability very few will in future be welded by hand labour this new process consisted in folding a bar of iron about a foot long into the form of a cylinder with the edges a little overlapping it was then placed in a furnace and being taken out when raised to a welding heat a triblet or cylinder of iron was placed in it and the whole was passed quickly through a pair of rollers the effect of this was that the welding was performed at a single heating and the remainder of the elongation necessary for extending the skelps to the length of the musket barrel was performed in a similar manner but at a lower temperature the workmen who had combined were of course no longer wanted and instead of benefiting themselves by their combination they were reduced permanently by this improvement in the art to a considerably lower rate of wages for as the process of welding gun barrels by hand required peculiar skill and considerable experience they had hitherto been in the habit of earning much higher wages than other workmen of their class on the other hand the new method of welding was far less injurious to the texture of the iron which was now exposed only once instead of three or four times to the welding heat so that the public derived advantage from the superiority as well as from the economy of the process another process has subsequently been invented applicable to the manufacture of a lighter kind of iron tubes which can thus be made at a price which renders their employment very general they are now to be found in the shops of all our larger ironmongers of various lengths and diameters with screws cut at each end; and are in constant use for the conveyance of gas for lighting or of water for warming our houses  similar examples must have presented themselves to all those who are familiar with the details of our manufactories but these are sufficient to illustrate one of the results of combinations it would not however be fair to push the conclusion deduced from these instances to its extreme limit although it is very apparent that in the two cases which have been stated the effects of combination were permanently injurious to the workman by almost immediately placing him in a lower class with respect to his wages than he occupied before; yet they do not prove that all such combinations have this effect it is quite evident that they have all this tendency it is also certain that considerable stimulus must be applied to induce a man to contrive a new and expensive process; and that in both these cases unless the fear of pecuniary loss had acted powerfully the improvement would not have been made if therefore the workmen had in either case combined for only a small advance of wages they would in all probability have been successful and the public would have been deprived for many years of the inventions to which these combinations gave rise it must however be observed that the same skill which enabled the men to obtain after long practice higher wages than the rest of their class would prevent many of them from being permanently thrown back into the class of ordinary workmen their diminished wages will continue only until they have acquired by practice a facility of execution in some other of the more difficult operations but a diminution of wages even for a year or two is still a very serious inconvenience to any person who lives by his daily exertion the consequence of combination has then in these instances been to the workmen who combinedreduction of wages; to the public reduction of price; and to the manufacturer increased sale of his commodity resulting from that reduction  it is however important to consider the effects of combination in another and less obvious point of view the fear of combination amongst the men whom he employs will have a tendency to induce the manufacturer to conceal from his workmen the extent of the orders he may at any time have received; and consequently they will always be less acquainted with the extent of the demand for their labour than they otherwise might be this is injurious to their interests; for instead of foreseeing by the gradual fallingoff in the orders the approach of a time when they must be unemployed and preparing accordingly they are liable to much more sudden changes than those to which they would otherwise be exposed in the evidence given by mr galloway the engineer he remarks that when employers are competent to show their men that their business is steady and certain and when men find that they are likely to have permanent employment they have always better habits and more settled notions which will make them better men and better workmen and will produce great benefits to all who are interested in their employment  as the manufacturer when he makes a contract has no security that a combination may not arise amongst the workmen which may render that contract a loss instead of a benefit; besides taking precautions to prevent them from becoming acquainted with it he must also add to the price at which he could otherwise sell the article some small increase to cover the risk of such an occurrence if an establishment consist of several branches which can only be carried on jointly as for instance of iron mines blast furnaces and a colliery in which there are distinct classes of workmen it becomes necessary to keep on hand a larger stock of materials than would be required if it were certain that no combinations would arise suppose for instance the colliers were to 'strike' for an advance of wagesunless there was a stock of coal above ground the furnaces must be stopped and the miners also would be thrown out of employ now the cost of keeping a stock of iron ore or of coals above ground is just the same as that of keeping in a drawer unemployed its value in money except indeed that the coal suffers a small deterioration by exposure to the elements the interest of this sum must therefore be considered as the price of an insurance against the risk of combination amongst the workmen; and it must so far as it goes increase the price of the manufactured article and consequently limit the demand which would otherwise exist for it but every circumstance which tends to limit the demand is injurious to the workmen; because the wider the demand the less it is exposed to fluctuation the effect to which we have alluded is by no means a theoretical conclusion; the proprietors of one establishment in the iron trade within the author's knowledge think it expedient always to keep above ground a supply of coal for six months which is in that instance equal in value to about l when we reflect that the quantity of capital throughout the country thus kept unemployed merely from the fear of combinations amongst the workmen might under other circumstances be used for keeping a larger number at work the importance of introducing a system in which there should exist no inducement to combine becomes additionally evident  that combinations are while they last productive of serious inconveniences to the workmen themselves is admitted by all parties; and it is equally true that in most cases a successful result does not leave them in so good a condition as they were in before 'the strike' the little capital they possessed which ought to have been hoarded with care for days of illness or distress is exhausted; and frequently in order to gratify a pride at the existence of which we cannot but rejoice even whilst we regret its misdirected energy they will undergo the severest privations rather than return to work at their former wages with many of the workmen unfortunately during such periods bad habits are formed which it is very difficult to eradicate; and in all those engaged in such transactions the kinder feelings of the heart are chilled and passions are called into action which are permanently injurious to the happiness of the individual and destructive of those sentiments of confidence which it is equally the interest of the master manufacturer and of his workman to maintain if any of the trade refuse to join in the strike the majority too frequently forget in the excitement of their feelings the dictates of justice and endeavour to exert a species of tyranny which can never be permitted to exist in a free country in conceding therefore to the working classes that they have a right if they consider it expedient to combine for the purpose of procuring higher wages provided always that they have completed all their existing contracts it ought ever to be kept before their attention that the same freedom which they claim for themselves they are bound to allow to others who may have different views of the advantages of combination every effort which reason and kindness can dictate should be made not merely to remove their grievances but to satisfy their own reason and feelings and to show them the consequences which will probably result from their conduct but the strong arm of the law backed as in such cases it will always be by public opinion should be instantly and unhesitatingly applied to prevent them from violating the liberty of a portion of their own or of any other class of society  amongst the evils which ultimately fall heavy on the working classes themselves when through mistaken views they attempt to interfere with their employers in the mode of carrying on their business may be mentioned the removal of factories to other situations where the proprietors may be free from the improper control of their men the removal of a considerable number of lace frames to the western counties which took place in consequence of the combinations in nottinghamshire has already been mentioned other instances have occurred where still greater injury has been produced by the removal of a portion of the skill and capital of the country to a foreign land such was the case at glasgow as stated in the fifth parliamentary report respecting artizans and machinery one of the partners in an extensive cotton factory disgusted by the unprincipled conduct of the workmen removed to the state of new york where he reestablished his machinery and thus afforded to rivals already formidable to our trade at once a pattern of our best machinery and an example of the most economical methods of employing it  when the nature of the work is such that it is not possible to remove it as happens with regard to mines the proprietors are more exposed to injury from combinations amongst the workmen but as the owners are generally possessed of a larger capital they generally succeed if the reduction of wages which they propose is really founded on the necessity of the case an extensive combination lately existed amongst the colliers in the north of england which unfortunately led in several instances to acts of violence the proprietors of the coalmines were consequently obliged to procure the aid of miners from other parts of england who were willing to work at the wages they could afford to give; and the aid of the civil and in some cases of the military power was requisite for their protection this course was persisted in during several months and the question being which party could support itself longest on the diminished gains as it might have readily been foreseen the proprietors ultimately succeeded  one of the remedies employed by the masters against the occurrence of combinations is to make engagements with their men for long periods and to arrange them in such a manner that these contracts shall not all terminate together this has been done in some cases at sheffield and in other places it is attended with the inconvenience to the masters that during periods when the demand for their produce is reduced they are still obliged to employ the same number of workmen this circumstance however frequently obliges the proprietors to direct their attention to improvements in their works and in one such instance within the author's knowledge a large reservoir was deepened thus affording a more constant supply to the waterwheel whilst at the same time the mud from the bottom gave permanent fertility to a piece of land previously almost barren in this case not merely was the supply of produce checked when a glut existed but the labour was in fact applied more profitably than it would have been in the usual course  a mode of paying the wages of workmen in articles which they consume has been introduced into some of our manufacturing districts which has been called the truck system as in many instances this has nearly the effect of a combination of the masters against the men it is a fit subject for discussion in the present chapter but it should be carefully distinguished from another system of a very different tendency which will be first described  the principal necessaries for the support of a workman and his family are few in number and are usually purchased by him in small quantities weekly upon such quantities sold by the retail dealer a large profit is generally made; and if the article is one whose quality like that of tea is not readily estimated then a great additional gain is made by the retail dealer selling an inferior article where the number of workmen living on the same spot is large it may be thought desirable that they should unite together and have an agent to purchase by wholesale those articles which are most in demand as tea suger bacon etc and to retail them at prices which will just repay the wholesale cost together with the expense of the agent who conducts their sale if this be managed wholly by a committee of workmen aided perhaps by advice from the master and if the agent is paid in such a manner as to have himself an interest in procuring good and reasonable articles it may be a benefit to the workmen and if the plan succeed in reducing the cost of articles of necessity to the men it is clearly the interest of the master to encourage it the master may indeed be enabled to afford them facilities in making their wholesale purchases; but he ought never to have the least interest in or any connection with the profit made by the articles sold the men on the other hand who subscribe to set up the shop ought not in the slightest degree to be compelled to make their purchases there the goodness and cheapness of the article ought to be their sole inducements it may perhaps be objected that this plan is only employing a portion of the capital belonging to the workmen in a retail trade; and that without it competition amongst small shopkeepers will reduce the articles to nearly the same price this objection would be valid if the objects of consumption required no verification; but combining what has been already stated on that subject with the present argument the plan seems liable to no serious objections  the truck system is entirely different in its effects the master manufacturer keeps a retail shop for articles required by his men and either pays their wages in goods or compels them by express agreement or less directly by unfair means to expend the whole or a certain part of their wages at his shop if the manufacturer kept this shop merely for the purpose of securing good articles at fair prices to his workmen and if he offered no inducement to them to purchase at his shop except the superior cheapness of his articles it would certainly be advantageous to the men but unfortunately this is not always the case; and the temptation to the master in times of depression to reduce in effect the wages which he pays by increasing the price of articles at his shop without altering the nominal rate of payment is frequently too great to be withstood if the object be solely to procure for his workmen better articles it will be more effectually accomplished by the master confining himself to supplying a small capital at a moderate rate of interest; leaving the details to be conducted by a committee of workmen in conjunction with his own agent and the books of the shop to be audited periodically by the men themselves  wherever the workmen are paid in goods or are compelled to purchase at the master's shop much injustice is done to them and great misery results from it whatever may have been the intentions of the master in such cases the real effect is to deceive the workman as to the amount he receives in exchange for his labour now the principles on which the happiness of that class of society depends are difficult enough to be understood even by those who are blessed with far better opportunities of investigating them and the importance of their being well acquainted with those principles which relate to themselves is of more vital consequence to workmen than to many other classes it is therefore highly desirable to assist them in comprehending the position in which they are placed by rendering all the relations in which they stand to each other and to their employers as simple as possible workmen should be paid entirely in money; their work should be measured by some unbiassed some unerring piece of mechanism; the time during which they are employed should be defined and punctually adhered to the payments they make to their benefit societies should be fixed on such just principles as not to require extraordinary contributions in short the object of all who wish to promote their happiness should be to give them in the simplest form the means of knowing beforehand the sum they are likely to acquire by their labour and the money they will be obliged to expend for their support thus putting before them in the clearest light the certain result of persevering industry  the cruelty which is inflicted on the workman by the payment of his wages in goods is often very severe the little purchases necessary for the comfort of his wife and children perhaps the medicines he occasionally requires for them in illness must all be made through the medium of barter; and he is obliged to waste his time in arranging an exchange in which the goods which he has been compelled to accept for his labour are invariably taken at a lower price than that at which his master charged them to him the father of a family perhaps writhing under the agonies of the toothache is obliged to make his hasty bargain with the village surgeon before he will remove the cause of his pain; or the disconsolate mother is compelled to sacrifice her depreciated goods in exchange for the last receptacle of her departed offspring the subjoined evidence from the report of the committee of the house of commons on framework knitters' petitions shows that these are not exaggerated statements it has been so common in our town to pay goods instead of money that a number of my neighbours have been obliged to pay articles for articles to pay sugar for drugs out of the druggist's shop; and others have been obliged to pay sugar for drapery goods and such things and exchange in that way numbers of times i was credibly informed that one person paid half a pound of tenpenny sugar and a penny to have a tooth drawn; and there is a credible neighbour of mine told me that he had heard that the sexton had been paid for digging a grave with sugar and tea and before i came off knowing i had to give evidence upon these things i asked this friend to enquire of the sexton whether this was a fact the sexton hesitated for a little time on account of bringing into discredit the person who paid these goods however he said at last 'i have received these articles repeatedlyi know these things have been paid to a great extent in this way' notes  see chapter xv p chapter  on combinations of masters against the public  a species of combination occasionally takes place amongst manufacturers against persons having patents and these combinations are always injurious to the public as well as unjust to the inventors some years since a gentleman invented a machine by which modellings and carvings were cut in mahogany and other fine woods the machine resembled in some measure the drilling apparatus employed in ornamental lathes; it produced beautiful work at a very moderate expense but the cabinetmakers met together and combined against it and the patent has consequently never been worked a similar fate awaited a machine for cutting veneers by means of a species of knife in this instance the wood could be cut thinner than by the circular saw and no waste was incurred; but 'the trade' set themselves against it and after a heavy expense it was given up the excuse alleged for this kind of combination was the fear entertained by the cabinetmakers that when the public became acquainted with the article the patentee would raise the price similar examples of combination seem not to be unfrequent as appears by the report of the committee of the house of commons on patents for inventions june see the evidence of mr holdsworth  there occurs another kind of combination against the public with which it is difficult to deal it usually ends in a monopoly and the public are then left to the discretion of the monopolists not to charge them above the growling pointthat is not to make them pay so much as to induce them actually to combine against the imposition this occurs when two companies supply water or gas to consumers by means of pipes laid down under the pavement in the street of cities it may possibly occur also in docks canals railroads etc and in other cases where the capital required is very large and the competition very limited if water or gas companies combine the public immediately loses all the advantage of competition and it has generally happened that at the end of a period during which they have undersold each other the several companies have agreed to divide the whole district supplied into two or more parts each company then removing its pipes from all the streets except those in its own portion this removal causes great injury to the pavement and when the pressure of increased rates induces a new company to start the same inconvenience is again produced perhaps one remedy against evils of this kind might be when a charter is granted to such companies to restrict to a certain amount the rate of profit on the shares and to direct that any profits beyond shall accumulate for the repayment of the original capital this has been done in several late acts of parliament establishing companies the maximum rate of profit allowed ought to be liberal to compensate for the risk; the public ought to have auditors on their part and the accounts should be annually published for the purpose of preventing the limitations from being exceeded it must however be admitted that this would be an interference with capital which if allowed should in the present state of our knowledge be examined with great circumspection in each individual case until some general principle is established on welladmitted grounds  an instrument called a gasmeter which ascertains the quantity of gas used by each consumer has been introduced and furnishes a satisfactory mode of determining the payments to be made by individuals to the gas companies a contrivance somewhat similar in its nature might be used for the sale of water; but in that case some public inconvenience might be apprehended from the diminished quantity which would then run to waste the streams of water running through the sewers in london are largely supplied from this source; and if this supply were diminished the drainage of the metropolis might be injuriously affected  in the north of england a powerful combination has long existed among the coalowners by which the public has suffered in the payment of increased price the late examination of evidence before a committee of the house of commons has explained its mode of operation and the committee have recommended that for the present the sale of coal should be left to the competition of other districts  a combination of another kind exists at this moment to a great extent and operates upon the price of the very pages which are now communicating information respecting it a subject so interesting to every reader and still more so to every manufacturer ofthe article which the reader consumes deserves an attentive examination we have shown in chapter xxi p the component parts of the expense of each copy of the present work; and we have seen that the total amount of the cost of its production exclusive of any payment to the author for his labour is s d another fact with which the reader is more practically familiar is that he has paid or is to pay to his bookseller six shillings for the volume let us now examine into the distribution of these six shillings and then having the facts ofthe case before us we shall be better able to judgeofthe meritsofthe combinationjust mentioned andtoexplainits effects  distribution of the profits on a six shilling book  buys at; sells at; profit on capital expended s d; s d no ithe publisher who accounts to the author for every copy received; ; ; per cent no iithe bookseller who retails to the public; ; ;  or ; ; no i the publisher is a bookseller; he is in fact the author's agent his duties are to receive and take charge of the stock for which he supplies warehouse room; to advise the author about the times and methods of advertising; and to insert the advertisements as he publishes other books he will advertise lists of those sold by himself; and thus by combining many in one advertisement diminish the expense to each of his principals he pays the author only for the books actually sold; consequently he makes no outlav of capital except that which he pays for advertisements but he is answerable for any bad debts he may contract in disposing of them his charge is usually ten per cent on the returns no ii is the bookseller who retails the work to the public on the publication of a new book the publisher sends round to the trade to receive 'subscriptions' from them for any number of copies not less than two these copies are usually charged to the 'subscribers' on an average at about four or five per cent less than the wholesale price of the book in the present case the subscription price is s d for each copy after the day of publication the price charged by the publisher to the booksellers is s d with some works it is the custom to deliver twentyfive copies to those who order twentyfour thus allowing a reduction of about four per cent such was the case with the present volume different publishers offer different terms to the subscribers; and it is usual after intervals of about six months for the publisher again to open a subscription list so that if the work be one for which there is a steady sale the trade avail themselves of these opportunities of purchasing at the reduced rate enough to supply their probable demand  the volume thus purchased of the publisher at s d or s d is retailed by the bookseller to the public at s in the first case he makes a profit of fortyfour in the second of thirtythree per cent even the smaller of these two rates of profit on the capital employed appears to be much too large it may sometimes happen that when a book is enquired for the retail dealer sends across the street to the wholesale agent and receives for this trifling service one fourth part of the money paid by the purchaser; and perhaps the retail dealer takes also six months' credit for the price which the volume actually cost him  in section the price of each process in manufacturing the present volume was stated we shall now give an analysis of the whole expense of conveying it into the hands of the public  the retail price s on produces total expense of printing and paper taxes on paper and advertisements commission to publisher as agent between author and printer commission to publisher as agent for sale of the book profitthe difference between subscription price and trade price d per vol profit the difference between trade price and retail price s d per vol    remains for authorship total this account appears to disagree with that in page but it will be observed that the three first articles amount to l s the sum there stated the apparent difference arises from a circumstance which was not noticed in the first edition of this work the bill amounting to l s as there given and as reprinted in the present volume included an additional charge of ten per cent upon the real charges of the printer and papermaker  it is usual for the publisher when he is employed as agent between the author and printer to charge a commission of ten per cent on all payments he makes if the author is informed of this custom previously to his commencing the work as was the case in the present instance he can have no just cause of complaint; for it is optional whether he himself employs the printer or communicates with him through the intervention of his publisher the services rendered for this payment are the making arrangements with the printer the woodcutter and the engraver if required there is a convenience in having some intermediate person between the author and printer in case the former should consider any of the charges made by the latter as too high when the author himself is quite unacquainted with the details of the art of printing he may object to charges which on a better acquaintance with the subject he might be convinced were very moderate; and in such cases he ought to depend on the judgement of his publisher who is generally conversant with the art this is particularly the case in the charge for alterations and corrections some of which although apparently trivial occupy the compositors much time in making it should also be observed that the publisher in this case becomes responsible for the payments to those persons  it is not necessary that the author should avail himself of this intervention although it is the interest of the publisher that he should; and booksellers usually maintain that the author cannot procure his paper or printing at a cheaper rate if he go at once to the producers this appears from the evidence given before the committee of the house of commons in the copyright acts may  mr o rees bookseller of the house of longman and co paternoster row examined q suppose a gentleman to publish a work on his own account and to incur all the various expenses; could he get the paper at s a ream? a i presume not; i presume a stationer would not sell the paper at the same price to an indifferent gentleman as to the trade q the committee asked you if a private gentleman was to publish a work on his own account if he would not pay more for the paper than persons in the trade; the committee wish to be informed whether a printer does not charge a gentleman a higher rate than to a publisher a i conceive they generally charge a profit on the paper q do not the printers charge a higher price also for printing than they do to the trade? a i always understood that they do  there appears to be little reason for this distinction in charging for printing a larger price to the author than to the publisher provided the former is able to give equal security for the payment with respect to the additional charge on paper if the author employs either publisher or printer to purchase it they ought to receive a moderate remuneration for the risk since they become responsible for the payment; but there is no reason why if the author deals at once with the papermaker he should not purchase on the same terms as the printer; and if he choose by paying ready money not to avail himself of the long credit allowed in those trades he ought to procure his paper considerably cheaper  it is time however that such conventional combinations between different trades should be done away with in a country so eminently depending for its wealth on its manufacturing industry it is of importance that there should exist no abrupt distinction of classes and that the highest of the aristocracy should feel proud of being connected either personally or through their relatives with those pursuits on which their country's greatness depends the wealthier manufacturers and merchants already mix with those classes and the larger and even the middling tradesmen are frequently found associating with the gentry of the land it is good that this ambition should be cultivated not by any rivalry in expense but by a rivalry in knowledge and in liberal feelings; and few things would more contribute to so desirable an effect than the abolition of all such contracted views as those to which we have alluded the advantage to the other classes would be an increased acquaintance with the productive arts of the country an increased attention to the importance of acquiring habits of punctuality and of business and above all a general feeling that it is honourable in any rank of life to increase our own and our country's riches by employing our talents in the production or in the distribution of wealth  another circumstance omitted to be noticed in the first edition relates to what is technically called the overplus which may be now explained when copies of a work are to be printed each sheet of it requires one ream of paper now a ream as used by printers consists of  quires or sheets this excess of sixteen sheets is necessary in order to allow for 'revises'for preparing and adjusting the press for the due performance of its work and to supply the place of any sheets which may be accidentally dirtied or destroyed in the processes of printing or injured by the binder in putting into boards it is found however that three per cent is more than the proportion destroyed and that damage is less frequent in proportion to the skill and care of the workmen from the evidence of several highly respectable booksellers and printers before the committee of the house of commons on the copyright act may it appears that the average number of surplus copies above is between two and three; that on smaller impressions it is less whilst on larger editions it is greater; that in some instances the complete number of is not made up in which case the printer is obliged to pay for completing it; and that in no instance have the whole sixteen extra copies been completed on the volume in the reader's hands the edition of which consisted of the surplus amounted to fiftytwoa circumstance arising from the improvements in printing and the increased care of the pressmen now this overplus ought to be accounted for to the authorand i believe it usually is so by all respectable publishers  in order to prevent the printer from privately taking off a larger number of impressions than he delivers to the author or publisher various expedients have been adopted in some works a particular watermark has been used in paper made purposely for the book thus the words 'mecanique celeste' appear in the watermark of the two first volumes of the great work of laplace in other cases where the work is illustrated by engravings such a fraud would be useless without the concurrence of the copperplate printer in france it is usual to print a notice on the back of the title page that no copies are genuine without the subjoined signature of the author and attached to this notice is the author's name either written or printed by hand from a wooden block but notwithstanding this precaution i have recently purchased a volume printed at paris in which the notice exists but no signature is attached in london there is not much danger of such frauds because the printers are men of capital to whom the profit on such a transaction would be trifling and the risk of the detection of a fact which must of necessity be known to many of their workmen would be so great as to render the attempt at it folly  perhaps the best advice to an author if he publishes on his own account and is a reasonable person possessed of common sense would be to go at once to a respectable printer and make his arrangements with him  if the author do not wish to print his work at his own risk then he should make an agreement with a publisher for an edition of a limited number; but he should by no means sell the copyright if the work contains woodcuts or engravings it would be judicious to make it part of the contract that they shall become the author's property with the view to their use in a subsequent edition of the works if they should be required an agreement is frequently made by which the publisher advances the money and incurs all the risk on condition of his sharing the profits with the author the profits alluded to are for the present work the last item of section or l s  having now explained all the arrangements in printing the present volume let us return to section and examine the distribution of the l paid by the public of this sum l was the cost of the book l was taxes l was the charges of the bookseller in conveying it to the consumer and l remained for authorship the largest portion or l goes into the pockets of the booksellers; and as they do not advance capital and incur very little risk this certainly appears to be an unreasonable allowance the most extravagant part of the charge is the thirtythree per cent which is allowed as profit on retailing the book it is stated however that all retail booksellers allow to their customers a discount of ten per cent upon orders above s and that consequently the nominal profit of fortyfour or thirtythree per cent is very much reduced if this is the case it may fairly be enquired why the price of l for example is printed upon the back of a book when every bookseller is ready to sell it at l s and why those who are unacquainted with that circumstance should be made to pay more than others who are better informed?  several reasons have been alleged as justifying this high rate of profit first it has been alleged that the purchasers of books take long credit this probably is often the case and admitting it no reasonable person can object to a proportionate increase of price but it is no less clear that persons who do pay ready money should not be charged the same price as those who defer their payments to a remote period secondly it has been urged that large profits are necessary to pay for the great expenses of bookselling establishments; that rents are high and taxes heavy; and that it would be impossible for the great booksellers to compete with the smaller ones unless the retail profits were great in reply to this it may be observed that the booksellers are subject to no peculiar pressure which does not attach to all other retail trades it may also be remarked that large establishments always have advantages over smaller ones in the economy arising from the division of labour; and it is scarcely to be presumed that booksellers are the only class who in large concerns neglect to avail themselves of them thirdly it has been pretended that this high rate of profit is necessary to cover the risk of the bookseller's having some copies left on his shelves; but he is not obliged to buy of the publisher a single copy more than he has orders for and if he do purchase more at the subscription price he proves by the very fact that he himself does not estimate that risk at more than from four to eight per cent  it has been truly observed on the other hand that many copies of books are spoiled by persons who enter the shops of booksellers without intending to make any purchase but not to mention that such persons finding on the tables various new publications are frequently induced by that opportunity of inspecting them to become purchasers this damage does not apply to all booksellers nor to all books; of course it is not necessary to keep in the shop books of small probable demand or great price in the present case the retail profit on three copies only namely s d would pay the whole cost of the one copy soiled in the shop; and even that copy might afterwards produce at an auction half or a third of its cost price the argument therefore from disappointments in the sale of books and that arising from heavy stock are totally groundless in the question between publisher and author it shold be remarked also that the publisher is generally a retail as well as a wholesale bookseller; and that besides his profit upon every copy which he sells in his capacity of agent he is allowed to charge the author as if every copy had been subscribed for at s d and of course he receives the same profit as the rest of the wholesale traders for the books retailed in his own shop  in the country there is more reason for a considerable allowance between the retail dealer and the public; because the profit of the country bookseller is diminished by the expense of the carriage of the books from london he must also pay a commission usually five per cent to his london agent on all those books which his correspondent does not himself publish if to this be added a discount of five per cent allowed for ready money to every customer and of ten per cent to book clubs the profit of the bookseller in a small country town is by no means too large some of the writers who have published criticisms on the observations made in the first edition of this work have admitted that the apparent rate of profit to the booksellers is too large but they have on the other hand urged that too favourable a case is taken in supposing the whole copies sold if the reader will turn back to section he will find that the expense of the three first items remains the same whatever be the number of copies sold; and on looking over the remaining items he will perceive that the bookseller who incurs very little risk and no outlay derives exactly the same profit per cent on the copies sold whatever their numbers may be this however is not the case with the unfortunate author on whom nearly the whole of the loss falls undivided the same writers have also maintained that the profit is fixed at the rate mentioned in order to enable the bookseller to sustain losses unavoidably incurred in the purchase and retail of other books this is the weakest of all arguments it would be equally just that a merchant should charge an extravagant commission for an undertaking unaccompanied with any risk in order to repay himself for the losses which his own want of skill might lead to in his other mercantile transactions  that the profit in retailing books is really too large is proved by several circumstances first that the same nominal rate of profit has existed in the bookselling trade for a long series of years notwithstanding the great fluctuations in the rate of profit on capital invested in every other business secondly that until very lately a multitude of booksellers in all parts of london were content with a much smaller profit and were willing to sell for ready money or at short credit to persons of undoubted character at a profit of only ten per cent and in some instances even at a still smaller percentage instead of that of twentyfive per cent on the published prices thirdly that they are unable to maintain this rate of profit except by a combination the object of which is to put down all competition  some time ago a small number of the large london booksellers entered into such a combination one of their objects was to prevent any bookseller from selling books for less than ten per cent under the published prices; and in order to enforce this principle they refuse to sell books except at the publishing price to any bookseller who declines signing an agreement to that effect by degrees many were prevailed upon to join this combination; and the effect of the exclusion it inflicted left the small capitalist no option between signing or having his business destroyed ultimately nearly the whole trade comprising about two thousand four hundred persons have been compelled to sign the agreement as might be naturally expected from a compact so injurious to many of the parties to it disputes have arisen; several booksellers have been placed under the ban of the combination who allege that they have not violated its rules and who accuse the opposite party of using spies etc to entrap them  the origin of this combination has been explained by mr pickering of chancery lane himself a publisher in a printed statement entitled 'booksellers' monopoly' and the following list of booksellers who form the committee for conducting this combination is copied from that printed at the head of each of the cases published by mr pickering  allen j leadenhall street arch j cornhill baldwin r paternoster row booth j duncan j paternoster row hatchard j piccadilly marshall r stationers' court murray j albemarle street rees o paternoster row richardson j m cornhill rivington j st paul's churchyard wilson e royal exchange  in whatever manner the profits are divided between the publisher and the retail bookseller the fact remains that the reader pays for the volume in his hands s and that the author will receive only s d; out of which latter sum the expense of printing the volume must be paid so that in passing through two hands this book has produced a profit of fortyfour per cent this excessive rate of profit has drawn into the book trade a larger share of capital than was really advantageous; and the competition between the different portions of that capital has naturally led to the system of underselling to which the committee above mentioned are endeavouring to put a stop  there are two parties who chiefly suffer from this combination the public and authors the first party can seldom be induced to take an active part against any grievance; and in fact little is required from it except a cordial support of the authors in any attempt to destroy a combination so injurious to the interests of both many an industrious bookseller would be glad to sell for s the volume which the reader holds in his hand and for which he has paid s; and in doing so for ready money the tradesman who paid s d for the book would realize without the least risk a profit of eleven per cent on the money he had advanced it is one of the objects of the combination we are discussing to prevent the small capitalist from employing his capital at that rate of profit which he thinks most advantageous to himself; and such a proceeding is decidedly injurious to the public  having derived little pecuniary advantage from my own literary productions; and being aware that from the very nature of their subjects they can scarcely be expected to reimburse the expense of preparing them i may be permitted to offer an opinion upon the subject which i believe to be as little influenced by any expectation of advantage from the future as it is by any disappointment at the past before however we proceed to sketch the plan of a campaign against paternoster row it will be fit to inform the reader of the nature of the enemies' forces and of his means of attack and defence several of the great publishers find it convenient to be the proprietors of reviews magazines journals and even of newspapers the editors are paid in some instances very handsomely for their superintendence; and it is scarcely to be expected that they should always mete out the severest justice on works by the sale of which their employers are enriched the great and popular works of the day are of course reviewed with some care and with deference to public opinion without this the journals would not sell; and it is convenient to be able to quote such articles as instances of impartiality under shelter of this a host of ephemeral productions are written into a transitory popularity; and by the aid of this process the shelves of the booksellers as well as the pockets of the public are disencumbered to such an extent are these means employed that some of the periodical publications of the day ought to be regarded merely as advertising machines that the reader may be in some measure on his guard against such modes of influencing his judgement he should examine whether the work reviewed is published by the bookseller who is the proprietor of the review; a fact which can sometimes be ascertained from the title of the book as given at the head of the article but this is by no means a certain criterion because partnerships in various publications exist between houses in the book trade which are not generally known to the public; so that in fact until reviews are established in which booksellers have no interest they can never be safely trusted  in order to put down the combination of booksellers no plan appears so likely to succeed as a counterassociation of authors if any considerable portion of the literary world were to unite and form such an association; and if its affairs were directed by an active committee much might be accomplished the objects of such an union should be to employ some person well skilled in the printing and in the bookselling trade; and to establish him in some central situation as their agent each member of the association to be at liberty to place any or all of his works in the hands of this agent for sale; to allow any advertisements or list of books published by members of the association to be stitched up at the end of each of his own productions; the expense of preparing them being defrayed by the proprietors of the books advertised the duties of the agent would be to retail to the public for ready money copies of books published by members of the association to sell to the trade at prices agreed upon any copies they may require to cause to be inserted in the journals or at the end of works published by members any advertisements which the committee or authors may direct to prepare a general catalogue of the works of members to be the agent for any member of the association respecting the printing of any work such a union would naturally present other advantages; and as each author would retain the liberty of putting any price he might think fit on his productions the public would have the advantage of reduction in price produced by competition between authors on the same subject as well as of that arising from a cheaper mode of publishing the volumes sold to them  possibly one of the consequences resulting from such an association would be the establishment of a good and an impartial review a work the want of which has been felt for several years the two longestablished and celebrated reviews the unbending champions of the most opposite political opinions are from widely differing causes exhibiting unequivocal signs of decrepitude and decay the quarterly advocate of despotic principles is fast receding from the advancing intelligence of the age; the new strength and new position which that intelligence has acquired demands for its expression new organs equally the representatives of its intellectual power and of its moral energies whilst on the other hand the sceptre of the northern critics has passed from the vigorous grasp of those who established its dominion into feebler hands  it may be stated as a difficulty in realizing this suggestion that those most competent to supply periodical criticism are already engaged but it is to be observed that there are many who now supply literary criticisms to journals the political principles of which they disapprove; and that if once a respectable and wellsupported review were established capable of competing in payment to its contributors with the wealthiest of its rivals it would very soon be supplied with the best materials the country can produce it may also be apprehended that such a combination of authors would be favourable to each other there are two temptations to which an editor of a review is commonly exposed the first is a tendency to consult too much in the works he criticizes the interest of the proprietor of his review; the second a similar inclination to consult the interests of his friends the plan which has been proposed removes one of these temptations but it would be very difficult if not impossible to destroy the other notes  the whole of the subsequent details relate to the first edition of this work  these details vary with different books and different publishers; those given in the text are believed to substantially correct and are applicable to works like the present  it is now understood that the use of spies has been given up; and it is also known that the system of underselling is again privately resorted to by many so that the injury arising from this arbitrary system pursued by the great booksellers affects only or most severely those whose adherence to an extorted promise most deserves respect note to the second edition  the monopoly cases nos  and of those published by mr pickering should be consulted upon this point; and as the public will be better able to form a judgement by hearing the other side of the question it is to be hoped the chairman of the committee mr richardson will publish those regulations respecting the trade a copy of which mr pickering states is refused by the committee even to those who sign them  at the moment when this opinion as to the necessity for a new review was passing through the press i was informed that the elements of such an undertaking were already organized  i have been suggested to me that the doctrines maintained in this chapter may subject the present volume to the opposition of that combination which it has opposed i do not entertain that opinion; and for this reason that the booksellers are too shrewd a class to supply such an admirable passport to publicity as their opposition would prove to be if generally suspected but should my readers take a different view of the question they can easily assist in remedying the evil by each mentioning the existence of this little volume to two of his friends i was wrong in this conjecture; all booksellers are not so shrewd as i had imagined for some did refuse to sell this volume; consequently others sold a larger number of copies in the preface to the second edition at the commencement of this volume the reader will find some further observation on the effect of the booksellers' combination  chapter  on the effect of machinery in reducing the demand for labour  one of the objections most frequently urged against machinery is that it has a tendency to supersede much of the hand labour which was previously employed; and in fact unless a machine diminished the labour necessary to make an article it could never come into use but if it have that effect its owner in order to extend the sale of his produce will be obliged to undersell his competitors; this will induce them also to introduce the new machine and the effect of this competition will soon cause the article to fall until the profits on capital under the new system shall be reduced to the same rate as under the old although therefore the use of machinery has at first a tendency to throw labour out of employment yet the increased demand consequent upon the reduced price almost immediately absorbs a considerable portion of that labour and perhaps in some cases the whole of what would otherwise have been displaced that the effect of a new machine is to diminish the labour required for the production of the same quantity of manufactured commodities may be clearly perceived by imagining a society in which occupations are not divided each man himself manufacturing all the articles he consumes supposing each individual to labour during ten hours daily one of which is devoted to making shoes it is evident that if any tool or machine be introduced by the use of which his shoes can be made in half the usual time then each member of the community will enjoy the same comforts as before by only nine and onehalf hours' labour  if therefore we wish to prove that the total quantity of labour is not diminished by the introduction of machines we must have recourse to some other principle of our nature but the same motive which urges a man to activity will become additionally powerful when he finds his comforts procured with diminished labour; and in such circumstances it is probable that many would employ the time thus redeemed in contriving new tools for other branches of their occupations he who has habitually worked ten hours a day will employ the half hour saved by the new machine in gratifying some other want; and as each new machine adds to these gratifications new luxuries will open to his view which continued enjoyment will as surely render necessary to his happiness  in countries where occupations are divided and where the division of labour is practised the ultimate consequence of improvements in machinery is almost invariably to cause a greater demand for labour frequently the new labour requires at its commencement a higher degree of skill than the old; and unfortunately the class of persons driven out of the old employment are not always qualified for the new one; so that a certain interval must elapse before the whole of their labour is wanted this for a time produces considerable suffering amongst the working classes; and it is of great importance for their happiness that they should be aware of these effects and be enabled to foresee them at an early period in order to diminish as much as possible the injury resulting from them  one very important enquiry which this subject presents is the question whether it is more for the interest of the working classes that improved machinery should be so perfect as to defy the competition of hand labour; and that they should thus be at once driven out of the trade by it; or be gradually forced to quit it by the slow and successive advances of the machine? the suffering which arises from a quick transition is undoubtedly more intense; but it is also much less permanent than that which results from the slower process and if the competition is perceived to be perfectly hopeless the workman will at once set himself to learn a new department of his art on the other hand although new machinery causes an increased demand for skill in those who make and repair it and in those who first superintend its use; yet there are other cases in which it enables children and inferior workmen to execute work that previously required greater skill in such circumstances even though the increased demand for the article produced by its diminished price should speedily give occupation to all who were before employed yet the very diminution of the skill required would open a wider field of competition amongst the working classes themselves that machines do not even at their first introduction invariably throw human labour out of employment must be admitted; and it has been maintained by persons very competent to form an opinion on the subject that they never produce that effect the solution of this question depends on facts which unfortunately have not yet been collected and the circumstance of our not possessing the data necessary for the full examination of so important a subject supplies an additional reason for impressing upon the minds of all who are interested in such enquiries the importance of procuring accurate registries at various times of the number of persons employed in particular branches of manufacture of the number of machines used by them and of the wages they receive  in relation to the enquiry just mentioned i shall offer some remarks upon the facts within my knowledge; and only regret that those which i can support by numerical statement are so few when the crushing mill used in cornwall and other mining countries superseded the labour of a great number of young women who worked very hard in breaking ores with flat hammers no distress followed the reason of this appears to have been that the proprietors of the mines having one portion of their capital released by the superior cheapness of the process executed by the mills found it their interest to apply more labour to other operations the women disengaged from mere drudgery were thus profitably employed in dressing the ores a work which required skill and judgement in the selection  the increased production arising from alterations in the machinery or from improved modes of using it appears from the following table a machine called in the cotton manufacture a 'stretcher' worked by one man produced as follows  year; pounds of cotton spun; roving wages per score; rate of earning per week   s d s d      the same man working at another stretcher the roving a little finer produced      in this instance production has gradually increased until at the end of twentytwo years three times as much work is done as at the commencement although the manual labour employed remains the same the weekly earnings of the workmen have not fluctuated very much and appear on the whole to have advanced but it would be imprudent to push too far reasonings founded upon a single instance  the produce of spindles of 'mule yarn spinning' at different periods was as follows year; hanks about to the pound; wages per thousand s d ; ;  ; ;  ; ; the subjoined view of the state of weaving by hand and by powerlooms at stockport in the years and is taken from an enumeration of the machines contained in factories and was collected for the purpose of being given in evidence before a committee of the house of commons     in  in  handloom weavers     decrease persons using powerlooms   increase persons to dress the warp    increase total persons employed    increase powerlooms     increase during this period the number of handlooms in employment has diminished to less than onethird whilst that of powerlooms has increased to more than five times its former amount the total number of workmen has increased about onethird; but the amount of manufactured goods supposing each powerloom to do only the work of three handlooms is three and a half times as large as it was before  in considering this increase of employment it must be admitted that the two thousand persons thrown out of work are not exactly of the same class as those called into employment by the powerlooms a handweaver must possess bodily strength which is not essential for a person attending a powerloom; consequently women and young persons of both sexes from fifteen to seventeen years of age find employment in powerloom factories this however would be a very limited view of the employment arising from the introduction of powerlooms the skill called into action in building the new factories in constructing the new machinery in making the steamengines to drive it and in devising improvements in the structure of the looms as well as in regulating the economy of the establishment is of a much higher order than that which it had assisted in superseding; and if we possessed any means of measuring this it would probably be found larger in amount nor in this view of the subject must we omit the fact that although handlooms would have increased in number if those moved by steam had not been invented yet it is the cheapness of the article manufactured by powerlooms which has caused this great extension of their employment and that by diminishing the price of one article of commerce we always call into additional activity the energy of those who produce others it appears that the number of handlooms in use in england and scotland in was about ; nearly the same number existed in the year whereas the number of powerlooms which in was had in been when it is considered that each of these powerlooms did as much work as three worked by hand the increased producing power was equal to that of handlooms during the whole of this period the wages and employment of handloom weavers have been very precarious  increased intelligence amongst the working classes may enable them to foresee some of those improvements which are likely for a time to affect the value of their labour; and the assistance of savings banks and friendly societies the advantages of which can never be too frequently or too strongly pressed upon their attention may be of some avail in remedying the evil but it may be useful also to suggest to them that a diversity of employments amongst the members of one family will tend in some measure to mitigate the privations which arise from fluctuation in the value of labour notes  in the workman's wages were guaranteed not to be less than s  chapter  on the effect of taxes and of legal restrictions upon manufactures  as soon as a tax is put upon any article the ingenuity of those who make and of those who use it is directed to the means of evading as large a part of the tax as they can; and this may often be accomplished in ways which are perfectly fair and legal an excise duty exists at present of d per pound upon all writing paper the effect of this impost is that much of the paper which is employed is made extremely thin in order that the weight of a given number of sheets may be as small as possible soon after the first imposition of the tax upon windows which depended upon their number and not upon their size newbuilt houses began to have fewer windows and those of larger dimensions than before staircases were lighted by extremely long windows illuminating three or four flights of stairs when the tax was increased and the size of windows charged as single was limited then still greater care was taken to have as few windows as possible and internal lights became frequent these internal lights in their turn became the subject of taxation; but it was easy to evade the discovery of them and in the last act of parliament reducing the assessed taxes they ceased to be chargeable from the changes thus successively introduced in the number the forms and the positions of the windows a tolerable conjecture might in some instances be formed of the age of a house  a tax on windows is exposed to objection on the double ground of its excluding air and light and it is on both accounts injurious to health the importance of light to the enjoyment of health is not perhaps sufficiently appreciated in the cold and more variable climates it is of still greater importance than in warmer countries  the effects of regulations of excise upon our home manufactures are often productive of great inconvenience; and check materially the natural progress of improvement it is frequently necessary for the purposes of revenue to oblige manufacturers to take out a license and to compel them to work according to certain rules and to make certain stated quantities at each operation when these quantities are large as in general they are they deter manufacturers from making experiments and thus impede improvements both in the mode of conducting the processes and in the introduction of new materials difficulties of this nature have occurred in experimenting upon glass for optical purposes; but in this case permission has been obtained by fit persons to make experiments without the interference of the excise it ought however to be remembered that such permission if frequently or indiscriminately granted might be abused the greatest protection against such an abuse will be found in bringing the force of public opinion to bear upon scientific men and thus enabling the proper authorities although themselves but moderately conversant with science to judge of the propriety of the permission from the public character of the applicant  from the evidence given in before the committee of the house of commons on distillation from sugar and molasses it appeared that by a different mode of working from that prescribed by the excise the spirits from a given weight of corn which then produced eighteen gallons might easily have been increased to twenty gallons nothing more is required for this purpose than to make what is called the wash weaker the consequence of which is that fermentation goes on to a greater extent it was stated however that such a deviation would render the collection of the duty liable to great difficulties; and that it would not benefit the distiller much since his price was enhanced to the customer by any increase of expense in the fabrication here then is a case in which a quantity amounting to oneninth of the total produce is actually lost to the country a similar effect arises in the coal trade from the effect of a duty for according to the evidence before the house of commons it appears that a considerable quantity of the very best coal is actually wasted the extent of this waste is very various in different mines; but in some cases it amounts to onethird  the effects of duties upon the import of foreign manufactures are equally curious a singular instance occurred in the united states where bariron was on its introduction liable to a duty of per cent ad valorem whilst hardware was charged at per cent only in consequence of this tax large quantities of malleable iron rails for railroads were imported into america under the denomination of hardware; the difference of per cent in duty more than counter balancing the expense of fashioning the iron into rails prior to its importation  duties drawbacks and bounties when considerable in amount are all liable to objections of a very serious nature from the frauds to which they give rise it has been stated before committees of the house of commons that calicoes made up in the form and with the appearance of linen have frequently been exported for the purpose of obtaining the bounty for calico made up in this way sells only at s d per yard whereas linen of equal fineness is worth from s d to s d per yard it appeared from the evidence that one house in six months sold five hundred such pieces of calico in almost all cases heavy duties or prohibitions are ineffective as well as injurious; for unless the articles excluded are of very large dimensions there constantly arises a price at which they will be clandestinely imported by the smuggler the extent therefore to which smuggling can be carried should always be considered in the imposition of new duties or in the alteration of old ones unfortunately it has been pushed so far and is so systematically conducted between this country and france that the price per cent at which most contraband articles can be procured is perfectly well known from the evidence of mr galloway it appears that from to per cent was the rate of insurance on exporting prohibited machinery from england and that the larger the quantity the less was the percentage demanded from evidence given in the report of the watch and clockmakers' committee in it appears that persons were constantly in the habit of receiving in france watches lace silks and other articles of value easily portable and delivering them in england at ten per cent on their estimated worth in which sum the cost of transport and the risk of smuggling were included  the process employed in manufacturing often depends upon the mode in which a tax is levied on the materials or on the article produced w atch glasses are made in england by workmen who purchase from the glass house globes of five or six inches in diameter out of which by means of a piece of redhot tobacco pipe guided round a pattern watch glass placed on the globe they crack five others these are afterwards ground and smoothed on the edges in the tyrol the rough watch glasses are supplied at once from the glass house; the workman applying a thick ring of cold glass to each globe as soon as it is blown causes a piece of the size of a watch glass to be cracked out the remaining portion of the globe is immediately broken and returns to the melting pot this process could not be adopted in england with the same economy because the whole of the glass taken out of the pot is subject to the excise duty  the objections thus stated as incidental to particular modes of taxation are not raised with a view to the removal of those particular taxes; their fitness or unfitness must be decided by a much wider enquiry into which it is not the object of this volume to enter taxes are essential for the security both of liberty and property and the evils which have been mentioned may be the least amongst those which might have been chosen it is however important that the various effects of every tax should be studied and that those should be adopted which upon the whole are found to give the least check to the productive industry of the country  in enquiring into the effect produced or to be apprehended from any particular mode of taxation it is necessary to examine a little into the interests of the parties who approve of the plan in question as well as of those who object to it instances have occurred where the persons paying a tax into the hands of government have themselves been adverse to any reduction this happened in the case of one class of calicoprinters whose interest really was injured by a removal of the tax on the printing they received from the manufacturers payment for the duty about two months before they were themselves called on to pay it to government; and the consequence was that a considerable capital always remained in their hands the evidence which states this circumstance is well calculated to promote a reasonable circumspection in such enquiries question do you happen to know anything of an opposition from calico printers to the repeal of the tax on printed calicoes? answer i have certainly heard of such an opposition and am not surprised at it there are very few individuals who are in fact interested in the nonrepeal of the tax; there are two classes of calicoprinters; one who print their own cloth send their goods into the market and sell them on their own account; they frequently advance the duty to government and pay it in cash before their goods are sold but generally before the goods are paid for being most commonly sold on a credit of six months they are of course interested on that account as well as on others that have been stated in the repeal of the tax the other class of calicoprinters print the cloth of other people; they print for hire and on redelivery of the cloth when printed they receive the amount of the duty which they are not called upon to pay to government sooner on an average than nine weeks from the stamping of the goods where the business is carried on upon a large scale the arrears of duty due to government often amount to eight or even ten thousand pounds and furnish a capital with which these gentlemen carry on their business; it is not therefore to be wondered at that they should be opposed to the prayer of our petition  the policy of giving bounties upon home productions and of enforcing restrictions against those which can be produced more cheaply in other countries is of a very questionable nature and except for the purpose of introducing a new manufacture in a country where there is not much commercial or manufacturing spirit is scarcely to be defended all incidental modes of taxing one class of the community the consumers to an unknown extent for the sake of supporting another class the manufacturers who would otherwise abandon that mode of employing their capital are highly objectionable one part of the price of any article produced under such circumstances consists of the expenditure together with the ordinary profits of capital the other part of its price may be looked upon as charity given to induce the manufacturer to continue an unprofitable use of his capital in order to give employment to his workmen if the sum of what the consumers are thus forced to pay merely on account of these artificial restrictions where generally known its amount would astonish even those who advocate them; and it would be evident to both parties that the employment of capital in those branches of trade ought to be abandoned  the restriction of articles produced in a manufactory to certain sizes is attended with some good effect in an economical view arising chiefly from the smaller number of different tools required in making them as well as from less frequent change in the adjustment of those tools a similar source of economy is employed in the navy by having ships divided into a certain number of classes each of which comprises vessels of the same dimensions the rigging made for one vessel will fit any other of its class; a circumstance which renders the supply of distant stations more easy  the effects of the removal of a monopoly are often very important and they were perhaps never more remarkable than in the bobbin net trade in the years and these effects were however considerably enhanced by the general rage for speculation which was so prevalent during that singular period one of the patents of mr heathcote for a bobbin net machine had just then expired whilst another for an improvement in a particular part of such machines called a turn again had yet a few years to run many licenses had been granted to use the former patent which were charged at the rate of about five pounds per annum for each quarter of a yard in width so that what is termed a sixquarter frame which makes bobbin net a yard and a half wide paid thirty pounds a year the second patent was ultimately abandoned in august infringements of it having taken place it was not surprising that on the removal of the monopoly arising from this patent a multitude of persons became desirous of embarking in a trade which had hitherto yielded a very large profit the bobbin net machine occupies little space; and is from that circumstance well adapted for a domestic manufacture the machines which already existed were principally in the hands of the manufacturers; but a kind of mania for obtaining them seized on persons of all descriptions who could raise a small capital; and under its influence butchers bakers small farmers publicans gentlemen's servants and in some cases even clergymen became anxious to possess bobbin net machines some few machines were rented; but in most of these cases the workman purchased the machine he employed by instalments of from l to l weekly for a six quarter machine; and many individuals unacquainted with the mode of using the machines so purchased paid others of more experience for instructing them in their use; l or l being sometimes given for this instruction the success of the first speculators induced others to follow the example; and the machinemakers were almost overwhelmed with orders for lace frames such was the desire to procure them that many persons deposited a large part or the whole of the price in the hands of the framemakers in order to insure their having the earliest supply this as might naturally be expected raised the price of wages amongst the workmen employed in machinemaking; and the effect was felt at a considerable distance from nottingham which was the centre of this mania smiths not used to flat filing coming from distant parts earned from s to s per week finishing smiths accustomed to the work gained from l to l per weekthe forging smith if accustomed to his work gained from l to l per week and some few earned l per week in making what are technically called insides those who were best paid were generally clock and watchmakers from all the districts round who received from l to l per week the settersuppersons who put the parts of the machine togethercharged l for their assistance; and a six quarter machine could be put together in a fortnight or three weeks  good workmen being thus induced to desert less profitable branches of their business in order to supply this extraordinary demand the masters in other trades soon found their men leaving them without being aware of the immediate reason some of the more intelligent however ascertained the cause they went from birmingham to nottingham in order to examine into the circumstances which had seduced almost all the journeymen clockmakers from their own workshops; and it was soon apparent that the men who had been working as clockmakers in birmingham at the rate of s a week could earn l by working at lace framemaking in nottingham on examining the nature of this profitable work the master clockmakers perceived that one part of the bobbin net machines that which held the bobbins could easily be made in their own workshops they therefore contracted with the machinemakers who had already more work ordered than they could execute to supply the bobbin carriers at a price which enabled them on their return home to give such increased wages as were sufficient to retain their own workmen as well as yield themselves a good profit thus an additional facility was afforded for the construction of these bobbin net machines and the conclusion was not difficult to be foreseen the immense supply of bobbin net thus poured into the market speedily reduced its price; this reduction in price rendered the machines by which the net was made less valuable; some few of the earliest producers for a short time carried on a profitable trade; but multitudes were disappointed and many ruined the low price at which the fabric sold together with its lightness and beauty combined to extend the sale; and ultimately new improvements in the machines rendered the older ones still less valuable functions of the body chapter i composition and general structure of the body anatomy is the study of the physical structure and physiology the study of the normal functions of the human body chemical constitution of the body—in the body only twenty elements have been found these include carbon oxygen hydrogen nitrogen sulphur phosphorus calcium magnesium manganese chlorin potassium and fluorin for the most part they appear in very complex and highly unstable combinations though oxygen and nitrogen may be said to exist uncombined in the blood alimentary canal and lungs hydrogen also occurs in simple form in the alimentary canal but as the result of fermentation not as an element of the body of the organic compounds some contain nitrogen and some do not the most important of the former are the proteins which are found only in living bodies and consist of carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and sulphur combined in very similar proportions the important proteins in the body are the serum albumen and fibrin found in the blood myosin in muscle globulin in the red bloodcorpuscles and casein in the milk similar to the proteins but capable of passing through membranes are the pg peptones the final result of protein digestion from which the albuminoids differ in that they contain no sulphur ferments containing nitrogen exist in all the cells of the body though more particularly in those of the digestive organs and the coloring matters as the bilirubin of the bile are nitrogenous the organic substances that do not contain nitrogen are the carbohydrates or starches the hydrocarbons or fats and the acids of which the most important is carbon dioxide given off by the lungs the inorganic substances are water which forms a large percentage of all the tissues and from onefourth to onethird of the whole body weight sodium chloride or common salt which plays an important part in keeping substances in solution potassium and magnesium chloride and hydrochloric acid found in the stomach the cell—although the body is a very complex organism the cell is its unit or foundation in fact the body begins life as a single protoplasmic cell the ovum which is frequently compared to the amœba a microscopic animal consisting of a single cell of protoplasm or living substance—a substance not well understood as yet—but possessing practically all the functions of the human body for although it has no organs and is homogeneous in structure the amœba can move by throwing out a process and can surround and absorb food which it builds up into new tissue discarding the waste the ovum however differs from the amœba in that it has a transparent limiting membrane and contains a darker spot the nucleus this in turn contains another smaller spot the nucleolus while through the protoplasm which is semifluid extends a fine network that seems to hold it in place the ovum is very small about ¹₁₂₅ inch in diameter and after fertilization grows by segmentation the nucleus dividing in two and the protoplasm grouping itself anew about the two nuclei this division continues each cell dividing and forming two or sometimes four new pg cells all of which at first appear alike by degrees however differentiation takes place and different groups of cells assume different characteristics thus the various tissues are gradually developed each with a structure and a function of its own and are distributed among the various organs each organ consisting of several tissues during the process of growth and even after full growth of the body is attained old cells are continually dying and being replaced by new ones the typical cell is circular but through being squeezed together in the tissues or for some other reason the cells vary in shape in different parts being at times hexagonal spindleshaped or columnar yet whatever their differences in shape or other characteristics they all live the same sort of life all protoplasm absorbs oxygen when it comes in contact with it and in the process of combining with it is in part burned or oxidized with the consequent setting free of heat and other forms of energy and the formation of carbon dioxide so long as the body is alive therefore whether it is in a state of activity or of rest it is the seat of constant chemical change throughout all its cells and to these chemical changes are due all the forms of energy manifested by the body for energy is never destroyed though it may appear in a different form and the elements of the human body are so combined that their energy may be liberated and manifested in the different functions the body exhibits the fundamental tissues of the body are the epithelial tissues the connective tissues including the cartilaginous and bony tissues and the muscular and nervous tissues of these the epithelial tissues serve as a protection to the surface of other tissues; the connective tissues together form a framework for the support and general protection of the other tissues; while energy is expended by muscular and nervous tissue the latter directing the former in its movements all the tissues are interdependent and the organs work together besides cells every tissue contains a certain amount of lifeless matter pg the intercellular substance which was at some time produced by the cells  fig —epithelium pavement epithelium; columnar epithelium; ciliated epithelium; stratified epithelium in epithelial tissue there is little intercellular substance the cells being close together and arranged generally as a skin or membrane covering external or internal surfaces when there are several layers of cells the deepest are columnar in shape and the others become more and more flattened and scalelike as they approach the surface where they are gradually rubbed off and replaced by the growth of new cells from below this stratified epithelium as it is called is found wherever a surface is exposed to friction as in the skin and in the mucous membrane of the mouth pharynx and esophagus and in that of the vagina and the neck of the uterus in simple epithelium where there is only a single layer of cells the cells may be pavement or hexagonal columnar glandular or ciliated according to their different functions the flat pavement cells occur where a very smooth surface is required as in the heart lungs bloodvessels serous cavities etc none of these surfaces communicate directly with the external surface of the body and the name endothelium is substituted for epithelium the columnar form of cell in the intestine facilitates the passage of leucocytes between the cells in glandular epithelium the cells vary according to the gland in which they occur their pg protoplasm being filled with the material the gland secretes finally ciliated epithelium is composed of columnar cells with cilia or little hairlike processes upon their free surface which serve to send secreted fluids and other matters along the surfaces where they occur as in the air passages parts of the generative organs the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord connective tissue has a great deal of intercellular substance one form areolar tissue is composed of a loose network of fine white fibers with a few yellow elastic fibers interspersed and with cells lying in the spaces between the fibers it connects and surrounds the different organs and parts holding them together yet allowing free motion and is one of the most extensively distributed of the tissues it is continuous throughout  fig —section of bladder epithelium hill closely allied to the areolar is the fibrous tissue in which the white fibers lie close together and run for the most part in one direction only this is found in ligaments joints and tendons as also in such fibrous protective membranes as the periosteum dura mater the fasciæ of muscles etc fibrous tissue is silvery white in appearance and is very strong and tough yet pliant it is not extensile elastic tissue on the other hand has a large predominance of yellow elastic fibers and is very extensile and elastic though not so strong as the fibrous it is found in the walls of the bloodvessels pg especially the arteries in the walls of the air tubes in the ligaments of the spine etc fatty or adipose tissue is formed by the deposit of fat in the cells of the areolar tissue and is found in most parts where the areolar tissue occurs though it varies largely in amount in different parts it is found pretty generally under the skin fills in inequalities about various organs and about the joints and exists in large quantities in the marrow of the long bones in moderate amounts it gives grace to the form and constitutes an important reserve fund  fig —adipose tissue leroy a fibrous tissue; b fat cells; c nucleus of fat cells; d fatty acid crystals in fat cells cartilage consists of groups of nucleated cells in intercellular substance it is very firm yet highly elastic and serves in the joints to break the force of concussion of the harder and less elastic bones except when it occurs at the end of a bone it is covered with a membrane called the perichondrium which carries its blood supply in the nose ear larynx and trachea it serves to give shape to keep the pg passages open and to afford attachment for muscles most of the skeleton of the fetus consists of cartilage which later develops into bone bone—in bone the intercellular tissue is rendered hard by the deposit of mineral salts the resulting material being of great strength and rigidity the texture may be close and dense like ivory or open and spongy the difference lying merely in the fact that the one has fewer spaces between the solid particles than the other there is usually a hard compact layer on the exterior of the bone as that is where the greatest crossstrain comes especially in the long bones while within is the cancellous or spongy tissue which gives lightness to the bone and is capable of withstanding enormous pressure though it can bear little crossstrain  fig —crosssection of compact bone tissue after sharpey structure of bone—the hard substance in bone is always arranged in lamellæ or bundles of bony fibers which in cancellous tissue meet to form a kind of latticework while in the dense tissue they are generally arranged in rings about the haversian canals channels through which the bloodvessels pass through the bone longitudinally between the lamellæ are spaces called lacunæ in which lie branched cells the spaces being connected with each other and with the haversian canals by numerous tiny canals or canaliculi pg by which nutrient material finds its way from the haversian canals to all parts of the bone within the bone is the medulla or marrow which is of two varieties the yellow which is largely fat and is found in the long bones of adults and the red which is nearly threefourths water and is found in most of the other adult bones and in the bones of the fetus and of the infant lining the medullary and cancellous cavities is a delicate connective tissue lining the endosteum which contains many boneforming cells while on the outside of the bone except at the articular ends is the periosteum with its outer protective layer and its inner vascular layer containing osteoblasts or boneforming cells the periosteum is essential for the growth of new bone where the old bone has died and if the periosteum is removed from healthy bone the part beneath is liable to die as it is by the constant growth of the osteoblasts that the bone grows and is renewed in the repair of broken bones tissue is formed between and around the broken ends bone formation—most of the skull and face bones begin as membranes of connective tissue that is are formed in membrane bones are also formed in cartilage the bone formation in this case beginning from centers of ossification where the deposit of lime salts in the intercellular substance begins the salts coming to the centers dissolved in the plasma such a center of growth in a bone is called the epiphysis and is separated from the main part of the bone or diaphysis by cartilage until full growth is attained when ossification becomes complete so in surgery in working on the bones of children part of the epiphysis should always be left for the sake of future growth the outer shell of compact tissue is deposited by the periosteum chemical composition of bone—chemically bone is composed of about onethird organic or animal matter largely gelatine and pg twothirds inorganic matter including various salts of calcium magnesium and sodium in young children the animal matter predominates and the bones are soft and often bend instead of breaking only the outside shell on one side giving way as in “greenstick” fracture in rickets there is a deficiency of lime salts but the increased brittleness of the bones in old age is due not to increase of mineral matter but to the less spongy texture of old bones classification and function of bones—there are in the body some two hundred bones which may be classified as long short flat and irregular occasionally an irregular bone develops in a fontanelle the membranous opening at the juncture of the sutures of the skull this is known as a wormian bone it is not however included in the two hundred as are not the sesamoid bones or bones developed in tendons with the exception of the patella or kneecap long bones are developed in cartilage and consist of a shaft two extremities and various processes they are more or less curved to give them strength and grace they serve as supports and act as levers for purposes of motion and the exercise of power since a hollow cylinder is just as strong as a solid one of the same size the weight coming only on the outer shell the great bones which are accountable for weight and which need to be light themselves have hollow shafts composed chiefly of compact tissue with a central medullary canal the ends however are expanded in order to make better connection at the joints and to afford broad surfaces for muscular attachment cancellous tissue being used in them for lightness and strength the large spongy ends also give elasticity and lessen jar and by bringing the tendons to the bone at a greater angle increase their effectiveness blood is brought to the long bones not only by the vessels of the periosteum but by the medullary artery which penetrates the compact tissue by the nutrient foramen and divides into an ascending and a descending branchpg  short bones are spongy throughout they are used for strength and where little motion is required flat bones are composed of two thin layers of compact tissue with a varying amount of cancellous tissue between and are for protection and muscular attachment the cancellous material between the two layers or tablets of the skull is called the diploë eminences and depressions occur on bones and when they are not articular are for the attachment of ligaments and muscles if they are articular they help to form joints as a whole the bony framework serves to keep the soft parts in place to support and protect them and to aid in locomotion the bones of the head and trunk support and protect organs; those of the arms are for tact and prehension; those of the lower extremities are for support and locomotion normally bones have little sensibility but when inflamed they are extremely sensitive and painful joints—the bones are connected with and move upon one another by means of joints these joints are of three kinds immovable where the adjacent margins of the bones are closely applied with little fibrous tissue between as in the sutures of the head; those with limited motion which are very strong the parts being connected with tough fibrocartilage; and freely movable in this last group the articulating surfaces are covered with cartilage which again is lined with a delicate synovial membrane which secretes a small amount of lubricating fluid the synovial fluid to reduce friction their surfaces are also sometimes deepened by the presence of interarticular fibrocartilages bursæ or sacs of synovial membrane occur outside the joints under tendons and ligaments to reduce friction the nature and extent of the motion of a joint is defined and the bones are held together by strong bands of fibrous tissue or ligaments these ligaments being more fully developed in joints where there is great pg freedom of motion or where there is great weight to be supported in a ballandsocket joint such as the hip there is a ligament in the form of a strong capsule which surrounds the joint on all sides and limits its motion while hinge joints like the elbow and pivot joints such as that formed by the atlas on the axis have lateral ligaments that allow of freer motion in the shoulderjoint which is the most freely movable joint in the body the capsular ligament is very lax in general the kinds of motion possible in joints may be said to be flexion extension abduction adduction circumduction and rotation when much violence is applied to a joint and no dislocation results as in a sprain there is often much stretching and even laceration of the ligaments muscle—the flesh which forms a large proportion of the weight of the body consists of muscular tissue of this two kinds are found the striated or striped muscle of animal life which is under the control of the will and so is known as voluntary muscle and the unstriped or smooth muscle of organic life over which we have no control that is the involuntary muscle each fiber of striped muscle has an elastic membranous sheath the sarcolemma and consists of rodshaped cells with a nucleus along the edge set end to end and having crosswise striations in unstriated muscle the fibers which have no sarcolemma consist of oval or spindleshaped cells with a nucleus much smaller than that of striped muscle and situated in the middle in both kinds of muscle the fibers are bound together with connective tissue and bloodvessels into fasciculi or bundles and many bundles go to make up a muscle the muscle in turn has a connective tissue envelope or sheath the fascia these fasciæ are found throughout the body the superficial ones being just beneath the skin while the deep ones not only form sheaths for the various muscles but form partitions between them and serve to strengthen their attachments pg the striped muscles are those of motion while the unstriped occur in the hollow organs surrounding the cavity and in some cases lessening its capacity by their contraction an intermediate form of muscle known as cardiac muscle occurs in the heart here the fibers have striations but the nucleus is generally in the middle of the cell and the fibers branch and run together  fig —voluntary muscle leroy a three voluntary fibers in long sections a

aiding in production of median line of hensen in life muscle appears more or less translucent and is contractile and alkaline but in death it loses its translucency and becomes rigid at the same time giving off in decomposition much carbon dioxide so that its reaction is acid this phenomenon of the muscles becoming rigid in death is called rigor mortis and occurs generally a few hours after pg death though it may come at once or be considerably delayed it may last anywhere from a few moments to several days but generally lasts from twentyfour to thirtysix hours it is probably due to the formation in the muscle of myosin a substance which probably comes from myosinogen in the living muscle and which is closely akin to the fibrin of blood probably the myosin or what precedes it causes clotting of the muscle just as fibrin or what precedes it causes clotting of the blood  fig —three voluntary muscle fibers from an injected muscle showing network of blood capillaries hill the muscles vary in shape in different parts of the body being long and slender in the limbs and broad and flat in the trunk they are attached chiefly to bones but also to cartilages ligaments and skin either by means of tendons which are cords or bands of white inelastic fibrous tissue or by means of aponeuroses membranous expansions of the same nature most voluntary muscles consist of a belly and two ends or tendons the origin is the fixed point from which it acts while the movable point upon which it acts is known as its insertion action of the muscles—when attached to bones muscles are distributed in three ways when it is necessary to produce much motion rapidly a short muscle is used when a part needs to be moved far and much contraction on the part of the muscle is therefore needed the muscle is very long as in the case of the sartorius pg muscle which shortens half its length finally where less distance has to be covered but greater power is required tendons are used as in this case the contraction is powerful but does not carry the part far in performing the mechanical work of the body the muscles are aided by the fact that the bones to which they are largely attached are set together loosely and form a set of levers on which the muscles act to perform certain definite acts all three classes of levers occur where the fulcrum is between the weight and the power as in the case of the head which is balanced by the muscles of the neck on the vertebræ; where the weight is between the fulcrum and the power as when a person raises himself upon his toes; and where the power is between the fulcrum and the weight as when the biceps is used to raise a weight held in the hand the erect position of the body is difficult to maintain because the center of gravity is high up and it is by the contraction of many muscles in the legs thighs back abdomen and neck that the body is balanced upright upon the feet physiology of muscle—irritability or sensitiveness to stimulation and contractility or the power to contract are the two most important functions of muscle contraction occurs in response to nervous energy brought by the nerves a nerve filament going to each muscle fiber into which it plunges its substance being lost and its sheath becoming continuous with that of the muscle fiber any irritant as heat electricity etc when applied to the nerve causes the muscle to contract moreover muscle has an irritability of its own and can contract independently of the nervous system in contracting it shortens and thickens bringing the two ends closer together and becomes firm and rigid the amount of contraction depends upon the strength of the stimulus and the irritability of the muscle the minimal stimulus is the least stimulus that will cause a contraction pg and the maximal is one that will cause the greatest contraction the work done depends in like manner upon the strength of the stimulus during contraction certain sounds are given off called muscle sounds which can be heard with the stethoscope but have no special significance the muscles which have the greatest power of rapid contraction are generally attached to levers indeed striated muscle is characterized by the rapidity and strength with which it works though its rhythmic motion is slight smooth muscle on the other hand is characterized by its great force considerable rhythm considerable tone and slight rapidity that is its contraction is slower and lasts longer than that of striated muscle cardiac muscle is characterized by great rhythm and force fair rapidity and slight tonicity tonicity being the amount of tone or readiness to work for even in sleep muscle is always in tone that is ready to do its work it is this that makes the difference in appearance between a living and a dead person and enables one to spring to his feet at night if he hears a noise a thing he could not do if his muscles were wholly relaxed thus rapidity is the great function of striated tonicity of smooth and rhythm of cardiac muscle in paralysis the muscles droop and lose their tone muscles are frequently the seat of rheumatic disorders when set free potential energy accomplishes work in muscle there is a good deal of potential energy which is set free as heat and as work accomplished even when the muscles are at rest chemical changes are going on and heat is being produced though more heat is produced when they are functioning if the body depended upon its gross motions for all its heat it would grow cold while a person rested the respiratory organs however and the heart are always working and chemical changes are constantly taking place ordinarily a muscle has some object in contracting such as the raising of a load and it contracts voluntarily more or less according to the pg weight of the load the amount of work done is calculated in footpounds or grammeters that is the energy required to raise one pound one foot or one gram one meter as a rule the muscles with the longest fibers as the biceps do the most work and those with a large number of fibers do more than those with less it has been calculated that whereas an engine gives back onetwelfth of the energy of the coal consumed muscle liberates onefourth of the energy brought to it in the form of food during activity the glycogen or sugar in the muscle is used up and the muscle becomes more acid owing to the lactic acid that is formed the carbon is taken in and carbon dioxide given off nitrogen puts the muscle in condition to do its work but is not so much used up in the work as is the carbohydrate material so it is the nonnitrogenous matter that does the work and any increase in urea the endproduct of protein metabolism is mere wear and tear sudden heat or cold causes muscular contraction and moderate heat favors both muscular and nervous irritability moderate cold however lessens the force of contraction and below zero muscle very largely loses its irritability without necessarily becoming rigid while well supplied with blood muscle will contract without fatigue but if the blood supply is shut off it soon loses its irritability and becomes rigid the more a muscle is used in moderation the more it develops but after it has done a certain amount of work it becomes exhausted losing its irritability or power to respond to stimuli and later becoming rigid such fatigue is due to the production of certain poisonous waste products which have a paralyzing effect on the nerves and which are ordinarily gradually carried away in the blood but which sometimes if produced to excess accumulate too fast for the blood wholly to remove them usually the nerve becomes exhausted first and the muscle substance later so long as it is connected with the nervous pg system a muscle will respond to stimuli but when the nerve becomes tired degeneration is more rapid in fact the degree of exhaustion is determined by several factors as by relation to the central nervous system variations in temperature blood supply and functional activity the process being more rapid in warm than in cold blooded animals cilia—a few motions are accomplished by tissue that is not muscular as in the case of the cilia attached to the cells of the respiratory tract which lie flat on the free surface and then lash forward serving in the air cells to keep the air in motion and in the tubes to send secretions from below upward and outward and to keep out foreign bodies cilia are also found in the female genital tract where they aid the passage of the ovum from the ovary to the womb they act together though apparently not governed by the nervous system as in the white corpuscles of the blood whose motion also is not muscular the changes that take place in ciliated epithelium are probably about the same as those in muscular tissue that is contractile the blood—to most of the tissues just described nourishment is brought in the blood which circulates through the body in a system of hollow tubes the arteries and veins whence it is distributed through the agency of the lymphatic system there are no bloodvessels however in the epidermis epithelium nails hair teeth nor in the cornea of the eye the vessels that carry the blood from the heart are called arteries those that return it veins the former begin as large vessels and gradually decrease in size; the latter begin as small vessels and form larger and larger trunks as they approach the heart the arteries have three coats a thin serous coat the internal or intima; a middle or muscular coat and an external coat of connective tissue the middle coat is the thickest and is the one that prevents the walls from collapsing when cut across except in the pg cranium each artery is enclosed in a sheath with its vein or veins the venæ comites usually the arteries occupy protected situations and are straight in their course where a vessel has to accommodate itself to the movements of a part however it may be curved as in the case of the facial artery which is curled on itself to allow for movements of the jaw they anastomose or communicate freely with one another thus promoting equality of distribution and pressure and making good circulation possible even after the obliteration of a large vessel the veins have three coats like the arteries but they are not so thick and the muscular coat is not so highly developed so that the walls collapse when cut and have no elasticity there are constrictions on the surface of many of the veins due to the presence of valves these valves are formed of semilunar folds of the lining membrane and are arranged in pairs they serve to prevent the blood whose circulation in the veins is sluggish from flowing back there are two sets of veins the superficial and the deep which communicate with each other in fact all the veins large and small anastomose very freely especially in the skull and neck where obstruction would result in serious trouble throughout the spinal cord and in the abdomen and pelvis the deep veins accompany the arteries in their sheath while the superficial ones have thicker walls and run between the layers of the superficial fascia under the skin terminating in the deep veins in the skull the venous channels take the form of sinuses formed by a separating of the layers of the dura mater with an endothelial lining that is continuous with that of the veins the capillaries are intermediate between the arteries and the veins the final division of the arteries and the first source of the veins they are tiny vessels with but a single coat continuous with the innermost coat of both arteries and veins and consisting practically of one layer of cells with a small amount of connective tissue between pg they spread in a great network throughout the tissues forming plexuses and being especially abundant where the blood is needed for other purposes than local nutrition as in the secreting glands their diameter is so small that the red corpuscles have to pass in single file and may even then be squeezed out of shape as they have no muscular tissue in their walls they have no power of contracting their walls however like those of the smaller arteries and veins are porous and by virtue of this quality they play an important part in the economy since in them the exchange takes place between the tissues and the blood the arteries in general carry freshly oxidized blood and the veins blood from which the oxygen has been largely used up and which contains waste material in the pulmonary system however the case is reversed the pulmonary arteries conveying venous blood as it is called from the heart to the lungs to be oxidized and the veins returning the blood after it has received its new supply of oxygen the pumping of the blood through the arteries is assisted by the contractions of the muscular coat while the elastic tissue of which it contains a certain amount gives elasticity to the walls and enables them to stretch and so to accommodate the larger blood supply forced into them at each beat by the heart the walls of the veins have not the power of contracting and the blood is pushed through more by gravity and the action of the arteries than by any action of their own the walls of all the vessels are nourished by tiny bloodvessels in the outer coat known as vasa vasorum and the nerves that regulate the action of the arteries are the vasomotor nerves from the vasomotor center in the medulla sufficient impulse goes from this center to the bloodvessels all the time to keep them somewhat contracted in a state of tone that is which is increased or diminished as the blood supply is to be diminished or increasedpg  lymphatic system—the lymphatic system also extends throughout the body and consists of a system of channels spaces and glands very closely related to the circulatory system and containing a fluid called lymph there are three principal parts to the system the lymph spaces which are open spaces with no definite walls in the connective tissue framework of the body more frequent near arteries and veins and especially so among the capillaries; the lymph capillaries or small vessels which connect the lymph spaces; and the lymphatic vessels of which there is a deep and a superficial set the latter accompanying the superficial veins on the surface of the body the former accompanying the deep bloodvesselspg  fig —diagram showing the course of the main trunks of the absorbent system the lymphatics of lower extremities d meet the lacteals of the intestines lac at the receptaculum chyli

small right duct opens into the veins on the right side the thoracic duct opens into the union of the great veins of the left side of the neck t yeo the lymph spaces are generally small though there are some large serous cavities such as the abdomen that may be considered as extended lymph spaces  fig —diagram of a lymphatic gland showing afferent a l and efferent e l lymphatic vessels; cortical

the lymph path or sinus l s which separates them from the adenoid tissue l h sharpey the lymphatic vessels have delicate transparent walls with three coats like the arteries though much thinner and anastomose even more freely than the veins they have a beaded appearance due to the presence of numerous valves which form constrictions on their surface the right lymphatic duct which is only about an inch long drains all the lymphatics of the right half of the upper part of the trunk the head and the neck approximately while the thoracic duct drains those of the rest of the body the latter which is the largest vessel of the pg system begins opposite the second lumbar vertebra with a bulblike reservoir for the lymph or chyle the receptaculum chyli and extends up along the spinal column for a distance of about eighteen inches to the seventh cervical vertebra where with the right lymphatic duct it empties into the left subclavian vein at its junction with the internal jugular thus establishing direct communication between the lymph spaces and the venous system the orifices of both vessels are guarded by semilunar valves to prevent regurgitation of the blood  fig —central superficial lymphatic glands of the axilla after leaf the lymphatic glands are small oval glandular bodies and occur here and there along the course of the lymphatics before entering one of them the vessel breaks up into several afferent vessels which form a plexus within and then emerge again as several efferent vessels which soon unite to form one trunk these glands occur chiefly in the mesentery along the great vessels and in the mediastinum axilla neck elbow groin and popliteal space the lymph varies in character with the locality being a little thicker and more opalescent in the lacteals as the lymphatics of the pg small intestine are called especially during digestion when fat is present here it is called chyle otherwise it is generally a clear transparent and slightly opalescent fluid which owing to the presence of fibrin clots when drawn from the body and allowed to stand in fact it resembles blood plasma very closely in composition and as it also contains a certain number of corpuscles or leucocytes that just correspond to the white corpuscles of the blood it is practically blood without the red corpuscles these leucocytes have considerable power of amœboid movement and are thought by some to play an important part in the absorption of food owing to intracapillary pressure the lymph transudes into the lymph spaces and bathes the tissues being carried away again by the lymphatics the amount of transudation is determined by the blood pressure—the greater the pressure the greater the amount of transudation—and is increased by some organic action of the cells in the walls of the vessels in the process of transudation a certain amount of solid matter goes through the wall of the vessel and it is probable that certain protein elements can be carried thus from the bloodvessels to the lymphatics though they do not pass through the capillary wall as readily as other substances some lymph is also probably formed by the action of the tissues themselves though the process is not understood all muscular movements active or passive including the respiratory movements tend to drive the lymph on its way by pressure the valves of the vessels keeping it from flowing back moreover its flow is from the capillaries to the veins or from a region of high pressure to one of less pressure there is probably also some contraction in the walls of the vessels themselves and the continual formation of lymph helps to drive it along if an obstruction to the circulation occurs however backpressure results and causes too great transudation in that event a limb becomes swollen pale and generally cool it pits on pg pressure the pressure driving the lymph out and there being no circulation to bring it back this condition is called œdema and occurs in liver kidney and heart troubles being generally first observed at the ankles in ascites hydrothorax hydrocephalus and pericardial and pleural effusions the fluid corresponds to lymph in its composition and the large amount is due to excessive formation of the fluid which is normally present in small quantities lymph gives the tissues substances from the blood that they need and carries off those they do not whether waste or substances of use to other tissues because they thus absorb certain materials not needed by the tissues and convey them to the circulation the lymphatics have also been called absorbents indeed lymph may be spoken of as the middleman between the blood and the tissues another function of the lymph is to lubricate thus the synovial fluid of the joints is lymph and the pleuræ and the pericardium contain lymph or serum to reduce the friction between the adjoining surfaces as much as possible the brain and spinal cord do not quite fill the cavities of the cranium and the spinal column but float on a cushion of lymph the cerebrospinal fluid when the brain which is subject to increase and diminution in size increases in size it drives the lymph out and when it diminishes the lymph returns the lymph glands serve as a protection to adjacent parts and when it leaves the gland the lymph is purer and richer in leucocytes than when it entered in fact they filter harmful matter from the lymph and apparently also form white corpuscles normally they can with difficulty be felt but in disease if the leucocytes are unable to destroy or carry off the poison the lymph carries it along to the glands which swell and become tender if the infection is not severe the swelling goes down and the tenderness passes after a short time but if it is severe there may be suppuration and abscess formation and pg the gland even perhaps be destroyed giving its life for the health of the part thus a wound in the foot if infected may cause irritation and enlargement of the glands at the knee and in the groin the lymphatic glands are frequently the seat of tubercular infection especially in the neck and are enlarged in scarlet fever tonsillitis and diphtheria in syphilis there is general glandular enlargement and the glands in the groin become enlarged in all diseases of the genital organs in malignant growths such as cancer the extension of the disease is often along the lines of the lymphatics glands—of glands in general a word might now be spoken they are of two kinds excreting and secreting and when simple are formed by the folding in of a free surface as in the case of the salivary gastric and sebaceous glands the cells at the gland becoming so modified as to be able to perform the function of excreting or secreting in racemose glands the gland is broken up into many pockets excreting glands take from an organ or from a part substances which have outlived their usefulness and are to be cast out of the body while the secreting glands form from the blood substances that did not exist in it before but which are of use to the body as the ptyalin of the saliva a strict line cannot however be drawn between the two kinds of glands most glands partaking more or less of both functions though the sebaceous and sweat glands are probably purely excreting glands and the salivary glands are almost purely secreting the glands moreover are more or less interchangeable in their functions that is they have vicarious function and one gland can take up and do for another what that other is for some reason unable to do in jaundice where there is stoppage of the bile duct the kidneys help out the liver by excreting the bile if one kidney is removed the other does work for both and the glands of the skin may help out the kidneys or vice versa hemorrhage from the lungs sometimes occurs in suppression of the mensespg  in a general way the function of glands is chemical they filter out by osmosis selecting the useful parts for secretion and the useless for excretion in the chemical action that goes on considerable energy is given off as is shown by the amount of pressure in the glands and by the fact that their temperature is higher than that of the blood they all work in a reflex manner being under the control of the central nervous system thus what is eaten affects the nerve terminals in the mouth the sensation passes to the nervous system and an impulse is carried by the motor nerves to the salivary glands most of the glands have ducts to convey away their secretion to other parts of the body or to send excretions out of the body but there are also ductless glands which though they seem to have some important function in the process of metabolism are not well understood most of them seem to manufacture some substance that is absorbed by the tissues and that plays an important part in the bodily metabolism though nothing is secreted by them externally they are said to have an internal secretion whereas the glands with ducts have an external secretion the liver has both forms of secretion the bile which is sent out and the glycogen that is stored the ductless glands are the thymus and thyroid glands the suprarenal capsules and the pituitary body in the brain nervous tissue—presiding over all the organs muscles and bloodvessels as the source of all action and all sensation are the nerves nervous tissue is of two kinds the gray or vesicular which originates impulses and receives impressions and the white or fibrous which conveys impressions the gray matter consists of large granular cells of protoplasm containing nuclei which give off many branches or dendrites from the under surface there usually comes one main branch the axiscylinder process these processes sometimes pg give off branches and sometimes not but they form the nerve fibers and carry impulses away from the nerve cells the cells of the processes are elongated in shape have a nucleus and are placed end to end with a definite constriction between them each axiscylinder process is surrounded by a sheath called the medullary sheath while each nerve fiber consists of a central axiscylinder process surrounded by the white substance of schwann and enclosed in a sheath a bundle of these fibers invested in a fibroareolar membrane called the neurilemma constitutes a nerve and of these the white matter is formed the blood supply is brought by minute vessels the vasa nervorum  fig —longitudinal nerve fiber diagrammatic a axiscylinder; b medullary sheath; c neurilemma; d nucleus; e node of ranvier leroy the nerves of the cerebrospinal system preside over animal life and have to do with voluntary acts while those from the sympathetic system regulate organic life and are quite independent of the will both sensory and motor nerves extend all over the body accompanying the arteries in a general way the sensory nerves end on the surface in plexuses in end bulbs situated in the papillæ of the skin or in tactile corpuscles these last occurring more especially where there is no hair the motor nerves end peripherally in plexuses or by end plates the central terminations of the motor nerves and the terminations of sensory nerves in special organs except where they end in a cell are not well understood like muscles nerves are probably never at rest for through them the muscles get their tone when a nerve acts no heat is produced and there is no change in the nerve afterward as there is in muscle probably nerve impulse is the transmission of physical rather than pg chemical changes along the fiber the atoms of the nerve being set in vibration and the vibrations being transmitted along its length stimulation is produced by physical injury by chemical influence by electricity by heat and the message is always referred to the nerve termination thus if the nerve at the elbow over the “crazy bone” is touched a tingling is felt in the fingers rather than at the point of pressure a person who has had an arm or leg amputated will frequently speak of his fingers or toes on that side being cold or complain of pain in them because the scar below the point of amputation tightens around the nerves and pinches them it is through the nerves that people get in touch with the outer world and that they judge of size weight etc all careful adjustment of the muscles is under the control of the nervous system pg  chapter ii the skin its appendages and its function the whole exterior surface of the body is covered by the skin an excreting and absorbing organ which serves as a protection to the parts beneath and is also the organ of touch it has two layers a superficial and a deep the superficial layer the epidermis or cuticle is composed wholly of epithelial cells of which the deepest layer is columnar and moulded upon the papillary layer of the derma while the intermediate layers are more rounded and the surface ones flat the deepest layer also contains the skin pigment which causes the variation in shade between the indian the negro and the white man below the epidermis which is chiefly protective is the tough elastic and flexible tissue of the derma or true skin in which are vested most of the activities of the skin its surface is covered with papillæ which are more numerous in the more sensitive parts each papilla contains one or more capillary loops and one or more nerve fibers while some terminate in an oval body known as a tactile corpuscle beneath the papillæ is the reticular layer composed of interlacing bands of fibrous tissue and containing bloodvessels lymphatics and nerves as well as unstriped muscle fibers where hair is present  fig —vertical section of skin pg at the apertures of the body the skin stops and is replaced by mucous membrane an integument of greater delicacy but which consists fundamentally of the same two layers a superficial bloodless epithelium and a deep fibrous derma it is continuous with the skin but is much redder and more sensitive and bleeds more easily the passages and cavities that it lines unlike those lined by serous membranes communicate with the exterior of the body and are for that reason protected against contact with foreign substances by mucus which is thicker and more sticky than the lymph that moistens the endothelium found on serous surfaces mucous membrane is found in the alimentary canal the respiratory tract and the genitourinary tract in cavities like the stomach and intestines which are subject to variations in capacity it is thrown into folds or rugæ the mucus is secreted by small glands in the membrane appendages of the skin—the skin has various appendages on the dorsal surface of the last phalanges of the fingers and toes are flattened and horny modifications of epithelium the nails they have a root embedded in a groove of skin by which they grow in length and a vascular matrix of derma beneath them which gives growth in thickness to their growth in length there seems to be no limit the hairs also which occur all over the body except on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet are a modification of the epithelium each hair has a bulbous root springing from an involution in the epidermis and derma called the hair follicle into which one or two sebaceous glands empty it is raised by involuntary muscle fibers and grows by constant additions to the surface by which it is attached this growth seems however to be limited and when its term pg is reached the hair falls out and is replaced by another the horny epithelial cells that go to form the hair contain the pigment that gives it its color  fig —skin and longitudinal section of hair a epidermis; b corium; c sebaceous gland; d fibrous rootsheath; e glassy membrane; f outer rootsheath; g inner rootsheath; h expanded bulbous end of hair; i papilla of hair; j arrector pili; k adipose tissue leroy like the hairs the sebaceous glands are situated in all parts of the body except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet they lie in the papillary layer and empty into the hair follicles except occasionally when they empty directly upon the surface of the skin they secrete an oily substance sebum the débris resulting from the degeneration of the epithelial cells of the gland itself which serves to keep the hair glossy and the skin soft and flexiblepg  the sweat glands on the other hand are more frequent on the palms and soles and though sometimes found in the derma are usually situated lower down in the subcutaneous cellular tissue they are least numerous on the back and neck coiled up in the lower layers of the skin they discharge the sweat through a spiral excretory duct upon its free surface the sweat is a clear colorless watery fluid with a salty taste an alkaline reaction and a characteristic odor that varies with the individual if very scanty it may be acid in reaction besides water it contains a small percentage of solids as inorganic salts especially sodium chloride fatty acids neutral fats and at times especially in some diseases of the kidneys urea that is the endproducts of the metabolism of starches and fats chiefly there is usually also some carbon dioxide whence the expression cutaneous respiration the sweat serves to keep the skin moist and in good condition to remove outworn and poisonous or irritating matters and to regulate the temperature as a rule it evaporates upon reaching the surface in which case it is known as invisible or insensible perspiration but if conditions of the atmosphere are not favorable to prompt evaporation as when the air is damp the skin becomes damp and there is visible perspiration though an abundant supply of blood increases the action of the sweat glands they are regulated by definite secretory nerves rather than by the vasomotor nerves in a cold sweat the action is probably due to some disturbance of the nerve supply without increase of the blood supply ordinarily perspiring is a reflex act due to the stimulation of the afferent cutaneous nerves as by the application of heat but sometimes as in cases of strong emotions involuntary impulses are sent from the brain to the spinal centers and so arouse the action of the glands atropin has the power of preventing the secretion of sweat pg by paralyzing the terminations of the secretory nerves while pilocarpin produces an opposite effect in a similar way on account of these sweat glands the skin becomes next in importance after the kidneys in the excretion of waste products the quantity of sweat excreted varies greatly and is hard to measure it is influenced by the temperature and humidity of the surrounding air by the nature and quantity of food and drink consumed by the amount of exercise the relative activity of other organs especially the kidneys and by certain mental conditions the hotter it is the greater the amount of perspiration in damp weather there may be less perspiration but it does not evaporate and is therefore more in evidence ordinarily man has a temperature of ° the source of this body heat or temperature is the general body metabolism muscular activity and activity of the glands especially of the liver which is constantly active the blood in the hepatic vein being warmer than that in any other part of the body the tissue of the brain also is said to be warmer than the surrounding blood and the heart and respiratory muscles which are in constant activity are responsible for much of the body heat the amount of heat generated in the body therefore varies at different times according as a person is awake or asleep quiet or active temperature regulation—the temperature is regulated by variations in the production and loss of heat less being known of its production than of its loss it has been calculated that fourfifths of the energy of the body is converted into heat onefifth into work as the minimum amount of heat produced in twentyfour hours is sufficient to raise gallons of water from ° to boilingpoint it is evident that if there were not some way for the escape of much of this heat the body would become hotter and hotter and finally destroy itself the temperature however except on the surface is uniform heat being pg lost as fast as it is produced for although oxidation at any point raises the heat of the blood at the point this heat is carried by the blood to other parts to which the surplus is given up while blood cooled in the skin goes to the hotter inward parts to cool them and be warmed itself in fact heat is expended by conduction and radiation through respiration perspiration and heat given to the urine and fæces it is therefore largely to per cent carried off through the skin and the lungs; to per cent is lost by radiation to the air and other bodies with which the body comes in contact; to per cent is lost by the evaporation of sweat to per cent by the warming of expired air urine and feces and to per cent by cold food that is taken in radiation acts more favorably where the surroundings are cool and the air in motion as on a breezy day conduction is carried on best where the surrounding air is cool especially if it is moist for moist air is a better conductor of heat than dry air evaporation is very important in hot weather or where men work in hot air even in health the temperature may range from ° to ° and a degree or two below or above is not dangerous when a person first gets up in the morning his temperature is apt to be subnormal but after food and exercise have been taken it becomes normal and stays so till the end of the day when if the person is tired it may go up a little if a person is tired out the temperature is apt to be subnormal there is also in the body what is called the vital tide which is highest afternoon and evening and lowest in the morning the rate of production of heat varies greatly in different people one person uses a certain amount of tissue more quickly than another that is he lives faster moreover size makes a difference in that a small body has more surface to its weight than a large one and so has to produce the same amount of heat at a faster rate in order to maintain the right temperature taking food increases heat probably because of pg the muscular effort needed to eat it muscular work is another factor and finally the whole matter of heat production seems to be under the control of the nervous system not much is known on this point except that there is a heat center in the medulla which plays an important part in heat production and whose influence is seen where the temperature shoots way up in disease just before death it is now thought that fever is due to a disturbance of this nervous mechanism though just what the disturbance is is not known fever is a condition of increased bodily temperature due to increased production or to decreased loss of heat as a rule in all fevers the metabolic changes in the body are increased hence the patient becomes emaciated in a long fever the frequent increase in the amount of urea during fever shows an increase in protein metabolism the temperature in fevers rises as high as ° and in sunstroke sometimes to ° except in sunstroke a higher temperature than ° generally means death subnormal temperature is due to a decrease in the bodily metabolism and so to lessened heat production as a rule if the functions are all active especially that of the sweat glands a person can be exposed to severe heat without the temperature being affected though sometimes on a hot summer day it may be up half to one degree the cause of heatstroke with its high fever is unknown but probably it is due to some effect on the heat center in the brain heat prostration is also due to prolonged exposure to heat but is generally accompanied by a subnormal temperature the effect of cold as in freezing is to diminish all the metabolic activities of the body the temperature can be artificially regulated more or less by variations of food varying amounts of exercise by drugs etc sense of touch—before passing on to a discussion of the individual parts a few words might well be said of the sense of touch since that is general and resides largely in the skin whose other pg functions have just been described it may be regarded as the form from which all the other special senses have developed certain portions of the body having become more sensitive than others to certain vibrations as the eye to those of light the internal organs probably have little sense of touch  figs —meissner’s corpuscle from man; × böhm davidoff and huber touch is useful only within arm’s reach but there gives one a sense of space that sight does not give it is practically determined by the touch corpuscles which are found in the skin over almost the entire body though they are more numerous in some places than in others the distribution of the corpuscles determining the sensitiveness of the skin these touch corpuscles are protoplasmic bodies containing nuclei about which are entwined filaments from the cutaneous nerves where the corpuscles are absent the filaments of the cutaneous nerves themselves play an important part the finger tips have a very delicate sense of touch and the tip of the tongue is the most sensitive part of the body pg hence spaces in the mouth seem larger than elsewhere by the transmission of sensations of touch to the brain the sensation is localized and the tactile sensation becomes a tactile perception there are three main divisions of the sense of touch sensations of touch proper or tactile sensation; sensations of temperature and sensations of pain the temperature sense is the transmission by the skin of sensations not so much of a certain degree of heat or cold as of the difference between the temperature of an object and that of the skin the longer an object is in contact with the skin the less conscious the person is of it not only because it becomes of the same temperature but also because he becomes accustomed to it there also seem to be in the skin besides the touch corpuscles two other terminal organs with separate nerve fibers the one for detecting heat the other cold; for there are places on the body where heat can be detected and cold cannot and vice versa sensations of pain may be merely an exaggeration of tactile sensation as in too hard pressure or too great heat but there seems to be also a sensation of pain in the skin all organs are said to have common sensibility to pain and any exaggeration of this sensibility causes a sensation of pain all the special senses require a certain amount of judgment in the interpretation of the sensations they convey pg  chapter iii the cranium and face the intelligence and all the special senses except the sense of touch already spoken of are gathered together compactly in the head where they are carefully protected with bony tissue covering the brain is the skull or cranium which is made up of eight bones the frontal the occipital two parietal two temporal the sphenoid and the ethmoid while the bones of the face are fourteen in number two nasal two superior maxillary two lachrymal two malar two palate two inferior turbinated the vomer and the inferior maxillary for the most part the bones are arranged in pairs one on either side the cranial bones—the cranium or skull is especially adapted for the protection of the brain and the bones are flat and closely fitted to its surface they have two layers of bone the outer and the inner tables of which the outer is the thicker and between these is a tissue filled with bloodvessels the diploë in the infant whose brain has not yet attained its full size opportunity must be left for growth and the skull therefore consists of a number of bones with interlocking notched edges where growth takes place but in the adult it forms one solid covering of bone the line where the edges of two cranial bones come together is called a suture the suture between the frontal bone and the forward edges of the two parietal bones is called the coronal suture that between the two parietal bones at the vertex of the skull is known as the longitudinal or sagittal suture and that between the occipital bone and the back edges of the parietal bones as the lambdoidal suturepg  where the coronal and sagittal sutures meet is a membranous interval known as the anterior fontanelle while the posterior fontanelle is at the juncture of the sagittal with the lambdoidal suture these fontanelles—so called from the pulsations of the brain that can be seen in them—close after birth either by the extension of the surrounding bones or by the development in them of small bones known as wormian bones the posterior one closing within a few months the anterior by the end of the second year in rickets however the anterior fontanelle remains open a long time sometimes into the fourth year  fig —cranium at birth showing sutures and fontanelles the frontal bone as its name implies forms the fore part of the head or forehead it joins the parietal bones above and the temporal bones on either side at the lower edge are the supraorbital arches each with a supraorbital notch or foramen on its inner margin for the passage of the supraorbital vessels and nerve the nerve most affected in neuralgia just above the arches on either side are the superciliary ridges behind which between the two tables of the skull lie the frontal sinuses on the inner surface the frontal sulcus for the longitudinal sinus runs along the median line the parietal bones are the side bones of the skull they meet pg each other in the sagittal suture at the median line above and join the frontal and occipital bones at either end while below they touch upon the temporal bones the temporal muscles being attached in part along their lower surface these muscles are inserted into the coronoid process of the lower jaw which they thus help to raise and to retract  fig —front view of the skull after sobotta the occipital bone is at the base of the skull and at birth consists of four pieces in the lower anterior part is the foramen magnum an oval opening through which the spinal cord passes from the skull down into the spinal canal half way between the foramen and the top of the bone is the external occipital protuberance for the attachment of the ligamentum nuchæ which holds the head erect the inner side of the bone is deeply concave and is divided by a crossshaped grooved ridge into four fossæ the internal occipital pg protuberance being situated where the arms of the cross meet the occipital lobes of the cerebrum lie in the two upper fossæ and the hemispheres of the cerebellum in the two lower ones in the grooves upon the ridge are the sinuses which collect the blood from the brain the occipital and frontal muscles united by a thin aponeurosis cover the whole upper cranium and are known as the occipitofrontalis muscle at the back this is attached to the occipital bone while in front it interlaces with various face muscles it is a powerful muscle and raises the brows wrinkles the forehead and draws the scalp forward long hair grows on the skin over it as a further protection against blows upon the skull and sudden variations in temperature the temporal bones—said to be so named because the hair over them is the first to turn with age—are situated at the sides and base of the skull and are in three portions the squamous or scalelike the mastoid or nipplelike and the petrous or stony portion the squamous is the upper portion and has projecting from its lower part the long arched zygomatic process which articulates with the malar bone of the face and from which arises the masseter muscle one of the chief muscles of mastication which has its insertion in the ramus and angle of the lower jaw just above the zygomatic process the temporal muscle has its origin in part while below is the glenoid fossa for articulation with the condyle of the lower jaw the posterior portion of the fossa being occupied by part of the parotid gland the rough mastoid portion of the temporal bone is toward the back and affords attachment to various muscles of which the most important are the occipitofrontalis and the sternocleidomastoid within it are the mastoid cells which communicate with the inner ear and are lined with mucous membrane continuous with that of the tympanum they probably have something to do with the hearing in children they often become pg the seat of inflammation mastoid abscess in infectious diseases and the mastoid bone has to be cut to let out pus that has collected as the lateral sinus is directly behind the mastoid bone there is very great danger of going through into the sinus and causing a fatal hemorrhage  fig —side view of the skull after sobotta the petrous portion which contains the organ of hearing is between and somewhat behind the other two portions at the lower edge of the temporal bone wedged between the sphenoid and the occipital bones on its outer surface is the external auditory meatus and from below projects a long sharp spine called the styloid process to which several minor muscles are attached in the same angle between the petrous and squamous portions lies the bony eustachian tube the sphenoid or wedge bone so called because in the process of development it serves as a wedge lies at the base of the cranium forming as it were the anterior part of the floor of the pg cavity containing the brain it is a large batshaped bone and articulates with all the cranial and many of the facial bones binding them all together it has a body two large wings and two lesser wings and appears on the outside of the skull between the frontal and the temporal bones behind the zygomatic process in the adult the body of the sphenoid is hollowed out into the sphenoid sinuses in which pus sometimes forms the ethmoid bone—in front of and below the sphenoid and extending forward to the frontal bone is the ethmoid the last of the cranial bones it consists of a horizontal cribriform or sievelike plate from either side of which depend lateral masses of ethmoid cells to the inner side of these masses are attached the thin curved turbinated bones superior and middle while between them is a vertical plate that forms the bony septum of the nose rising from the upper surface of the cribriform plate is another vertical plate the crista galli with the olfactory grooves on either side for the reception of the olfactory bulbs filaments of the olfactory nerve passing down through the perforations of the cribriform plate to the nose for the brain which fills almost the entire cavity of the cranium is supported by the sphenoid and ethmoid bones internally as it is protected externally by the other cranial bones ossification of sutures—if premature ossification of all the sutures occurs idiocy results while in cephalocele there is a gap in the ossifying of the bones so that the membranes or brain protrude in rickets the forehead is high and square and the face bones poorly developed so that the head looks larger than it really is in paget’s disease the bones enlarge and soften this affects the head but not the face and often the first thing noticed is that the hat is too small craniotabes is thinning of the bone in places the bone becoming like parchment and being easily bent it is generally caused by pressure of the pillow or the nurse’s arm bones of the face—the facial bones serve to form the various pg features of the face which after all are merely organs of special sense many delicate muscles control the facial expression which consciously or unconsciously reflects the character of their owner surgically the most important of the facial bones are the two superior maxillary bones because of the number of diseases to which they are liable they meet in front together forming the upper jaw and with the malar bone help form the lower part of the orbit of the eye they are cuboid in shape and are hollowed out into a pyramidal cavity called the antrum of highmore which opens by a small orifice into the middle nasal meatus and which sometimes becomes infected and has to be tapped the nasal process for articulation with the frontal and nasal bones has at its lower edge a crest for the inferior turbinated bone and close beside this on the inside extending down from the upper edge is a deep groove which with the lachrymal and inferior turbinated bones helps to form the lachrymal canal for the nasal tear duct the bones give attachment to many small muscles connected for the most part with the nose and mouth of which the masseter is the only important one the two malar or cheek bones are small quadrangular bones which form the prominences of the cheeks and help form the orbits of the eyes projecting backward from each is a zygomatic process for articulation with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone while a maxillary process extends downward for articulation with the superior maxillary here again the most important muscle attached is the masseter if the malar bone is crushed great deformity results the lachrymal bones are two small bones about the size and shape of a fingernail situated at the front of the inner wall of the orbit at the external edge is a groove which lodges the lachrymal sac above and forms part of the lachrymal canal below the two palate bones are at the back of the nasal fossæ and help to form the floor of the nose the roof of the mouth and the orbit each pg has a vertical and a horizontal plate and it is these last that by their juncture form the hard palate oftentimes in cases of harelip cleft palate also occurs the result of incomplete development to remedy the consequent opening in the roof of the mouth which makes articulation difficult operation is generally resorted to though sometimes a plate is fitted over the opening by a dentist the nasal bones are two small oblong bones which articulate with the frontal and superior maxillary bones and with each other they form the bridge of the nose the rest of the nose being wholly of cartilage except for the vomer a bone shaped like a ploughshare which forms part of the nasal septum articulating along its anterior edge with the ethmoid and the triangular cartilage the two inferior turbinated bones lie along the outer walls of the nasal fossæ they are thin scrolllike bones covered with mucous membrane and serve to heat the air as it passes in sometimes when one has a cold the membrane and the bone too swell up and close the nares loss of the sense of smell in a bad cold may be due to such swelling and the consequent impeding of the entrance of odoriferous particles—a condition that would likewise interfere with the sense of taste part of the bone is sometimes removed to enlarge the passage enough being left to warm the air lastly there is the inferior maxillary bone or lower jaw this has a horseshoeshaped body and two rami one at either end each ramus has a pointed process in front called the coronoid process into which is inserted the temporal muscle at the back and separated from the coronoid process by the sigmoid notch is the condyle which articulates with the glenoid fossa on the temporal bone the rami also give attachment to the masseter muscle at its point of insertion in adult age the ramus is almost vertical but in old age the portion of the jaw hollowed out into alveoli for the teeth becomes absorbed and pg the angle of the jaw becomes very obtuse on the inner side of the jaw near the middle on either side is the fossa for the sublingual gland while the submaxillary gland lies in a fossa farther back on either side sometimes the lower jaw is dislocated and when once this has occurred it is liable to occur again the ligaments becoming stretched pg  chapter iv the organs of special sense the nose—the nose the organ of the sense of smell is composed of a framework of bones and cartilages the bridge being formed by the two nasal bones and the septum by the vomer and the triangular cartilage it consists of two parts the external nose and the internal or nasal fossæ which open to the face by the anterior nares or nostrils and into the pharynx by the posterior nares externally it is covered with skin internally with ciliated mucous membrane the fossæ have the inferior turbinated bones along their outer walls and are divided into three parts known as the superior the middle and the inferior meatus the middle one connecting with the antrum of highmore while into the inferior meatus the lachrymal canal empties there are many small muscles of which little use is pg made although in forced respiration as in pneumonia where every aid to breathing is called into play even the alæ nasi or nostrils are made to exert what muscular power they possess in order to supply more air  fig —the nasal cavity after sobotta not only is most of the air breathed in through the nose and warmed in its passage through but the nose is the organ of smell and by means of the peculiar property of its nerves protects the lungs against deleterious gases and helps the taste discriminate the olfactory or first cranial nerves after emerging from the brain lie on the under surface of the frontal lobe and rest on the ethmoid bone in what is known as the olfactory tract each nerve ends in a bulblike termination called an olfactory bulb which rests on the cribriform plate and sends little terminal fibers down through to be distributed to the nasal cavities especially to the upper half of the septum of the nose the roof of the nose and the anterior and middle turbinated bones for in the mucous membrane of the upper nasal cavity are specially modified epithelial cells called olfactory cells which play an important part in the conduction of smell hence when one wishes to smell anything especially well he sniffs it up probably the sensation of smell is caused by odoriferous particles in the atmosphere being breathed into the nose where they affect the olfactory cells which transmit the impulses to the olfactory nerve and so to the brain whereas a certain amount of moisture in the nasal cavity seems to be essential for accuracy of smell the presence of too much or too little interferes with it the mucous membrane has a certain power also of distinguishing different smells at the same time though this power varies greatly in different people one smell often wholly overpowering all others the cartilage below the bridge of the nose is sometimes attacked in syphilis and cancer and lupus often begins on the nose deviation of the septum may occlude all air from one side of the nose an effect also produced by polypi generally of the turbinated pg bone either condition is easily remedied nosebleed though generally unimportant may be serious in adults the mouth—the mouth is of great importance as an entrance for fresh air to the lungs when the nasal passages are for any reason impeded and as the resonant chamber from which proceeds the voice man’s chief means of communication with his fellows its chief value may be said however to reside in the fact that it is the vestibule of the alimentary canal it is an ovoid cavity lined with mucous membrane and is bounded in front by the lips at the sides by the cheeks below by the floor and tongue and above by the hard palate anteriorly and by the soft palate posteriorly the uvula depending from the latter like a curtain between the mouth and the pharynx shape is given to the mouth by the bones of the upper and lower jaw and its size is altered by the lowering and raising of the latter which is quite freely movable  fig —the hyoid bone toldt at the back of the mouth at the entrance to the pharynx are the anterior and posterior pillars of the fauces which contain muscular tissue and between which on either side are thick masses of lymphoid tissue the tonsils the floor of the mouth is formed largely by the tongue which completely fills the space within the pg lower teeth its base or root is directed backward and downward and is attached by muscles to the hyoid bone and the lower jaw the hyoid bone being a horseshoeshaped bone lying just below and as it were within the inferior maxillary the base of the tongue is attached also to the epiglottis and at the sides to the soft palate by the anterior pillars except at its base and the posterior part of its under surface the tongue is free but a fold of mucous membrane the frenum holds it somewhat in front thus it possesses great versatility of motion and serves as an auxiliary in articulation mastication and deglutition the teeth—securely embedded in either jaw are the teeth nature’s instrument for the first preparation of the food for digestion through tearing and grinding the incisors which are in front have wide sharp edges for cutting the food next come the canine teeth with a sharp point for tearing it while at the back are the molars with a broad flat top for grinding there are two sets of teeth the temporary or milk teeth twenty in number—four incisors two canines and four molars in each jaw—which appear at from six months to two years and the permanent teeth thirtytwo in number—four incisors two canines known as eye teeth in the upper jaw and as stomach teeth in the lower jaw four bicuspids so called because they have two cusps where the molars have four or five and six molars in each jaw—which come from the sixth to the twentyfirst years the first to appear are the two lower middle incisors which come at the age of six months the last to appear are the wisdom teeth the farthest back of the molars which come at the age of twentyone years or thereabouts each tooth consists of a crown or body above the gum a neck and a fang or root within the gum the body is of dentine or ivory with a thin crust of enamel and contains the pulp a vascular connective tissue containing many nerves beginning at the neck and covering the fang is a layer of cement or true bonepg  the sense of taste—the sense of taste lies chiefly in the taste buds as they are called which are filled with gustatory cells and are found in the papillæ of the tongue principally in the circumvallate papillæ at the back of the tongue which are few in number and arranged in a vshape there is also a certain power of taste in the tip and sides of the tongue but little in the upper surface or dorsum only five special tastes can be distinguished bitter sweet acid sour and salt but sometimes more than one can be distinguished at a time as bitter and sweet every one can distinguish between different tastes but the power varies in different people and with different conditions certain tastes seem to be better distinguished in certain places as sweet at the tip and bitter at the back of the tongue moreover the sense of taste is very dependent upon the sense of smell especially in the case of aromatic and savory substances which one really does not taste but smell if one held his nose and closed his eyes he would not know from the taste whether he was eating onion or apple this leads to the habit of pinching the nose when taking nauseous medicines to be tasted a substance must be in solution friction against the tongue lips or cheek increase the sense of taste a temperature of ° fahrenheit favors taste while both great heat and great cold impair it there are probably at least two nerves of taste the lingual branch of the trifacial or fifth cranial and the gustatory branch of the glossopharyngeal along with the sense of taste there are other senses in the mouth which play an important part such as pressure and the sense of heat and cold and it is often hard to distinguish them from the pure sensation of taste which indeed is always accompanied by them salivary glands—on either side of the mouth are three racemose glands for the secretion of the saliva which serves to soften and lubricate the food and partially to digest starches by means of its pg ferment ptyalin the parotid gland is the largest and is below and in front of the ear opening by stensen’s duct the submaxillary gland is below the jaw toward the back on either side and its duct is wharton’s duct the sublingual gland lies beneath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth and opens by eight to twenty tiny ducts beside the frenum the ducts of rivinus the activity of the glands depends upon the blood supply; the more blood the greater their activity  fig —dissection of the side of the face showing the salivary glands a sublingual gland; b submaxillary gland with its duct opening on the floor of the mouth beneath the tongue at d; c parotid gland and its duct which opens on the inner side of the cheek after yeo the tonsils—the tonsils vary in size and in tonsillitis swell and may even meet in the median line they are frequently removed when they are enlarged one often gets a third tonsil or adenoids a lymphoid growth at the back of the pharynx which causes mouthbreathing by day and snoring by night a child with adenoids is starved for air and what air is breathed in is not warmed the growth should be removed a short frenum produces tonguetie which may be remedied by snipping cancer of the tongue is fairly common and necessitates a radical operation in mumps the parotid glands are inflamed and enlargedpg  the ear—the special organ of hearing is the ear to which there are three parts the external the middle and the internal ear the external ear consists of the pinna or expanded cartilaginous portion for the concentration and direction of sound waves and the external auditory canal partly cartilage partly bone which is directed forward inward and downward and conveys sound to the middle ear  fig —the small bones of the ear; external view enlarged after gray the middle ear or tympanum is an irregular cavity in the petrous portion of the temporal bone its outer wall is formed by the membrana tympani or drum an oval translucent membrane placed obliquely at the bottom of the external auditory canal the middle ear communicates with the inner ear through the fenestra ovalis or oval window and contains the ossicles the malleus or hammer the incus or anvil and the stapes or stirrup which are arranged in a movable chain from the drum to the oval window the malleus which is connected with the membrana tympani articulates by its head with the body of the incus while the stapes articulates with the incus by its head and is connected by its base with the margin of the oval window connection is made between the middle ear and the pharynx and the pressure of the air upon the drum made equal on either side by means of the eustachian tubes these tubes are about an inch and a half long have cilia and pg convey wax and other matter from the ear to the pharynx occasionally in a cold or for some other reason they become stopped up and trouble results in the middle ear some of the mastoid cells also connect with the middle ear and may become infected causing mastoid disease  fig —interior view of left bony labyrinth after removal of the superior and external walls  the superior posterior and external or horizontal semicircular canals; fovea hemielliptica; fovea

the lamina spiralis separating and from quain after sömmerring the internal ear consists of various chambers hollowed out in the petrous portion of the temporal bone there is an osseous labyrinth consisting of a central cavity known as the vestibule three semicircular canals and the cochlea and within the osseous labyrinth surrounded by perilymph is the membranous labyrinth of like form filled with the endolymph communication exists externally with the middle ear by the round and oval windows and internally with the internal auditory canal through which passes the eighth cranial or auditory nerve the special nerve of hearing which is distributed to the inner ear only when the auditory nerve enters the ear through this internal auditory meatus it divides into two branches pg of which one goes to the vestibule and the other to the organ of corti a group of specially modified epithelial cells in the cochlea of the membranous labyrinth which is very important in transmitting the impulses to the brain the nerve also breaks up into very small branches and is distributed practically throughout the wall of the labyrinth the sensation of hearing is the result of impulses transmitted to the auditory nerve and so conveyed to the auditory center in the brain it is caused by sound waves which travel through the air from their point of origin and enter the external ear this collects and selects the waves of sound and helps one to a certain extent to determine the direction from which the sound comes as they pass through the external meatus the sound waves are collected into a comparatively small area for transmission to the middle ear where by means of the drum they set in vibration the chain of ossicles through these the vibrations are in turn transmitted to the oval window being intensified in the process here again they are taken up by the perilymph from which they pass through the wall of the membranous labyrinth to the endolymph affecting the epithelial lining of the labyrinth in such a way that the impulses are transmitted to the auditory nerve more particularly in the vestibule from which the vibrations enter the cochlea they also affect the cells of the organ of corti in like manner as they pass from the perilymph to the endolymph the membrane that covers the fenestra rotunda or round window relaxes and expands as the vibrations strike it thus serving to eliminate the shock of impact musical sounds are caused by rhythmical or regularly repeated vibrations while irregular vibrations give rise to noises in musical sounds loudness is determined by the height or amplitude of the vibrations pitch by the length of the wave and quality by the number of so called partial tones a sensation of sound cannot be produced by pg less than vibrations a second and the ordinary person cannot hear more than vibrations a second different sounds can be distinguished when they follow each other as closely as by one onehundredth of a second all sound does not come through the canal of the ear the bones of the head vibrate and carry sound so there are instruments for the deaf which are put in the ear and others which are placed between the teeth the semicircular canals are not essential to hearing but have something to do with a person’s power of maintaining his equilibrium injury to them may cause dizziness and loss of equilibrium the eye—one more feature perhaps the most expressive remains to be described the eye the senses are all modifications of the original cutaneous sensibility and the nerve of sight is no more sensitive to light than any other nerve it therefore needs an end organ that is sensitive to the motions of the ether in order to give impressions of light this organ is provided in the eye which is not only itself capable of being moved in every direction but is placed in the most movable part of the body the head which can be turned in almost a complete circle the eyeball is spherical and lies in the cavity of the orbit upon a cushion of fat where it has a large range of sight but is securely protected from injury by its bony surroundings the sunken eyes following protracted illness are due to the using by the system of the fat on which the eyeball ordinarily rests each orbital cavity is formed by the juncture of some seven bones and communicates with the cavity of the brain through the optic foramen and through the sphenoidal fissure above the orbits are arched eminences of skin the eyebrows from which several rows of short hairs grow longitudinally and which serve to protect the eyes and to limit the amount of light to a certain extent as in frowningpg  still further protection is afforded by the eyelids longitudinal folds of skin the one above the other below which close like curtains over the eye beneath the external layer of skin in the lids is fatty tissue and then the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle by means of which they are closed they are kept in shape by the tarsal plates or cartilages in whose ocular surface are embedded the meibomian glands whose secretion prevents the free edges of the lids from sticking together along these edges grows a double or triple row of stiff hairs the eyelashes which curve outward so as not to interfere with each other and also to prevent the entrance into the eye of foreign bodies lining the inner surface of the lids and reflected thence over the anterior surface of the sclerotic coat of the eye is a mucous membrane the conjunctiva which is thick opaque and vascular on the lids but thin and transparent on the eyeball the angles between the lids are known as the internal and the external canthus  fig —the external ocular muscles pyle muscles and nerves—the eyeball is held in position by the ocular muscles the conjunctiva and the lids while surrounding it yet allowing free movement is a thin membranous sac the tunica vaginalis oculi the superior and inferior recti muscles at the upper and lower edges of the ball turn the eye up pg and down; the internal and external recti at the inner and outer edges turn the eye inward and outward; and the superior and inferior oblique rotate the eye the nerves supplying these muscles are the third or motor oculi the fourth and the sixth the lachrymal gland which is about the size and shape of an almond is situated at the upper and outer part of the orbit it secretes a fluid which keeps the anterior surface of the eye bathed in moisture and is ordinarily drained away through the lachrymal sac in the inner canthus whence it passes by the lachrymal ducts into the nose when the amount secreted is excessive it overflows the lower lid as tears  fig —diagram of the lacrimal apparatus pyle coats of eye—the membranes or coats of the eye are three in number an outer or sclerotic a middle or vascular and an inner or sensitive the sclerotic coat is a rather thick fibrous protective membrane where it passes in front of the iris however it is thinner and transparent and is known as the cornea the cornea projects somewhat and as it were resembles a segment of a smaller sphere set into the rest of the sclerotic the middle or vascular coat known as the choroid carries bloodvessels for the retina or sensitive coat in its inner layer and has an outer layer of pigment cells that excludes light and darkens the inner chamber of the eye the folds of the choroid at its anterior pg margin contain the ciliary muscles and are known as the ciliary processes while the name iris is given to the little round pigmented perforated curtainlike muscle just in front of the crystalline lens the posterior surface of the iris is covered with a thick layer of pigment cells to prevent the entrance of light except through the central opening or pupil and its anterior surface also has pigment cells that give it its color though the difference in the color of people’s eyes is due rather to the amount of pigment present than to its color a small amount of pigment being present in blue eyes and a large amount in brown and black eyes variations in the size of the pupil are brought about by contractions of the circular and radiating fibers of the iris contraction of the circular fibers making it smaller and those of the radiating larger the pupil is constricted for near objects and during sleep and is dilated for distant objects in a dull light also it dilates to let in more light and in a bright light it contracts the appearance of the pupil is often important as a means of diagnosis and in etherization  fig —vertical section through the eyeball and eyelids pyle lastly there is the innermost sensitive coat or retina which has eight layers the outer one containing some pigment cells and the next pg the rods and cones in which the power of perception is supposed to lie branches of the optic nerve being distributed over it in all directions in fact the retina is formed by a membranous expansion of the optic or second cranial nerve the special nerve of sight which passes into the orbit through the optic foramen at the back and enters the eyeball close to the macula lutea or yellow spot the exact spot where the optic nerve enters the retina is not sensitive and is known as the blind spot in the center of the macula lutea however which is in the middle of the retina posteriorly is a tiny pit the fovea centralis in which all the layers of the retina except the rods and cones are absent and at this point vision is most perfect it is therefore always turned toward the object looked at and when one wishes to see an object distinctly he must keep moving his eyes over it that the rays from each part may fall in turn upon the fovea centralis directly behind the pupil is the crystalline lens a rather firm gelatinous body enclosed in a capsule which is transparent in life but opaque in death the lens is doubly convex and is held in place by the suspensory ligaments which arise from the ciliary processes in front of it is the anterior chamber of the eye filled with a thin watery fluid called the aqueous humor while the larger space back of it occupying about fourfifths of the entire globe is filled with a jellylike substance known as the vitreous humor the chief artery of the eye is the ophthalmic light rays—the eye is practically a camera and its principal function is to reflect images although there are several refracting surfaces and media for practical purposes the cornea alone need be considered except for those rays which enter the eye perpendicularly to the cornea whose line of entrance is called the optic axis all rays are refracted when they enter the eye and the point at which they meet and cross each other behind the cornea is called the principal focus of the eye to focus properly all the rays from any one point pg on an object must meet again in a common point upon the retina their conjugate focus in the normal eye all the rays from an object are focused on the retina and form upon it an image of the object which as in the camera is inverted because of the crossing of the rays behind the cornea once focused on the retina the light traverses the various layers to the layer of rods and cones where chemical action takes place and affects the little filaments of the optic nerve by which the message is carried to the brain fig —diagram showing the difference between a emmetropic b myopic and c hypermetropic eyes american textbook of physiology when the eye is at rest the pupil and lens are in their normal pg condition and at such times the eye sees only distant objects the ability of the eye to focus upon objects at different distances is called accommodation and to accomplish it three things are necessary change in the shape of the lens; convergence of the axes of the eyes and narrowing of the pupils when the eye is directed toward distant objects the muscle fibers in the ciliary processes relax causing tightening of the suspensory ligaments and consequent flattening of the surface of the lens otherwise an image would be formed in front of the retina; for the greater the convexity of the lens the greater the angle of refraction such accommodation is passive and so not fatiguing to look at nearby objects on the contrary the ciliary muscles contract drawing the choroid forward and allowing the suspensory ligaments to relax so that the lens bulges in front this is an exertion in order to accommodate properly moreover both eyes must work together and the axes of both eyes must be directed toward the object therefore in looking at nearby objects the axes of the eyes converge drawn by the internal recti muscles in strabismus or cross eye where the axes of both eyes cannot be directed toward the object at the same time the rays fall upon one part of one eye and upon a different part of the other eye and two separate images are seen finally there is concentric narrowing of the pupil by contraction of the circular fibers of the iris by which means various side rays that would come to a focus outside the retina are excluded all the muscles of accommodation the ciliary muscles the internal recti and the sphincter pupillæ are under the control of the third nerve connected with this power of accommodation and dependent on it are the two conditions of nearsightedness or myopia and farsightedness or hypermetropia the normal eye is emmetropic and is almost perfectly spherical but in pg the nearsighted or myopic eye the ball instead of being round is flattened from above down and so bulges in front consequently owing to the greater distance from the lens to the retina images are formed in front of the retina only nearby objects can be seen clearly because the farther the object from the eye the farther in front of the retina the image is formed concave glasses are worn to enable nearsighted people to see at a distance hypermetropic or farsighted eyes are flattened from before backward and can see only objects at a distance clearly as those nearby form images behind the retina for such eyes convex glasses are worn as the ordinary person approaches middle life he becomes able to see better at a distance than near to this presbyopia as it is called which is practically farsightedness is due to a partial loss of the power of accommodation in the lens the result of a general loss of elasticity in the parts another very common defect is astigmatism a failure of the rays to focus upon a point owing generally to a flattening in the surface of the cornea color perception is also an important function of the eye the waves of hyperluminous ether when of a certain rate of vibration give the sensation of heat and when their vibrations are more rapid they give the sensation of light each of the primary colors of the spectrum gives off a pretty definite number of light rays which travel through the air and enter the eye the number of rays determining the color thrown upon the retina and the velocity determining the intensity of the color occasionally when light is passing through into the eye it is broken up as in a prism and the person gets a sensation as of all sorts of colors chromatic aberration total or partial absence of sensitiveness to color is called color blindness it is commonest in the form of inability to distinguish between red and green and is probably due to a defect in the retinapg  sometimes a hair follicle on the lid becomes infected and a sty is formed pink eye is conjunctivitis or inflammation of the conjunctiva a meibomian duct may become stopped and cause bulging or there may be a sagging down or ptosis of the upper lid in certain diseases as meningitis apoplexy and more especially syphilis rodent ulcer often begins by the eye or on the cheek pg  chapter v the nervous system the nervous system which regulates all the vital processes of the body physical and chemical and which is situated partly in the head and partly in the trunk may well form the connecting link between the description of the head and that of the trunk it has two divisions the cerebrospinal system and the sympathetic system the former consists of the cerebrum or brain proper the cerebellum or little brain the pons varolii the medulla oblongata the spinal cord and the cranial and spinal nerves; the latter of a series of ganglia or aggregations of nerve centers the brain which includes the cerebrum cerebellum pons and medulla occupies the cranium and the spinal cord is contained within the bony framework of the spinal column in the male the brain weighs about ounces and in the female while in an idiot it seldom weighs more than ounces the cerebrum or brain proper has two parts or hemispheres roughly oval in shape each of which has five lobes separated by fissures the frontal parietal occipital and temporosphenoidal lobes and the central lobe or island of reil at the base of the brain the chief fissures are the longitudinal fissure the fissure of sylvius at the base of the brain and the fissure of rolando between the frontal and parietal lobes there are also five serous cavities called ventricles the two lateral and the third fourth and fifth ventricles of which the first two one in either hemisphere are the most important around these cavities is the brain substance which is made up of two tissues the white and the gray the latter pg forming the outer part of the brain to the depth of perhaps half an inch and the white matter forming the rest the outer or gray part is called the cortex and is largely made up of nerve cells it might be called the active part of the brain the white part consists largely of nerve fibers which are given off from the nerve cells and are carried down into the spinal cord the surface of the brain is convoluted the ridges being separated by deep furrows or sulci by which means a great extent of gray matter is secured the furrows contain fluid from the subarachnoid spaces and vary in number and depth according to intelligence while the convolutions are not uniform in all brains the principal ones are constant both the brain and the spinal cord are covered by three membranes the dura mater the arachnoid and the pia mater the dura mater is dense and fibrous and lines the interior of the skull being firmly adherent to it at many points in fact it constitutes the internal periosteum of the cranial bones the arachnoid is a delicate serous membrane with two layers lubricated to prevent friction which divides the space between the dura mater and the pia mater bridging over the convolutions and enclosing the subdural and subarachnoid spaces which are connected with lymphatics and contain a serous secretion the cerebrospinal fluid this fluid forms an elastic water cushion on which the brain rests and prevents concussion the pia mater is vascular containing bloodvessels lymphatics and nerves and is closely attached to the surface of the brain dipping down into all the sulci at the base or under surface of the brain are some very important structures the olfactory bulbs lie beneath the frontal lobe and projecting back is the olfactory tract through which the olfactory nerves come from the brain back of the olfactory tract is the optic commissure where the optic nerves coming from the brain cross each other and back of the commissure again is the optic tract where the pg

tortuosity breaking the force of the blood stream in the small vessels where congestion would be with difficulty relieved the basilar artery which is formed by the juncture of the two vertebrals divides into the pg two posterior cerebrals each of which joins one of the anterior cerebrals by a posterior communicating artery the two anterior cerebrals also are joined by an anterior communicating artery thus completing the circle the circle thus formed at the base of the brain is called the circle of willis and provides for a good supply of blood in event of an accident to any vessel the blood is returned to the general circulation through the cerebral veins and sinuses formed by the separation of the dura mater into two layers the cerebellum is about oneseventh the size of the cerebrum and weighs about ounces it lies in the lower occipital fossæ of the skull and is oblong in shape and divided into two lateral hemispheres by a transverse fissure it is made up of both white and gray matter of which the former predominates the gray being external as in the cerebrum the cells are about the same as in the cortex and its surface is traversed by queer furrows of its function little is known but it probably plays a most important part in the coördination of the nervous and muscular acts by which the movements of the body are carried on at the back of the cerebrum and below the cerebellum is the pons varolii which forms a connecting link with the medulla oblongata or bulging part of the cord it is made up essentially of white matter or nerve fibers though there is a small amount of gray matter in which are found the nuclei of some of the cranial nerves in the medulla oblongata which is about inch long and extends from the pons varolii to the upper border of the atlas or first cervical vertebra the gray matter is not necessarily external to the white but is found in patches in the white the gray matter here corresponds more or less to that of the spinal cord and the white matter is continuous with that of the cord from the medulla arise the fifth to twelfth cranial nerves and the vasomotor nerves the cardiac nerve has its center here and here too are the centers of respiration pg phonation deglutition mastication and expression in the medulla the nerves that arise in the cerebrum cross over from one side of the body to the other on the crossed pyramidal tracts the importance of this crossing of the nerve fibers is seen in apoplexy when a bloodvessel is ruptured in the brain and hemorrhage causes pressure generally on the motor tract paralysis of the nerves and of the muscles to which they go results the paralysis is generally of one side of the body the opposite side from that on which the injury occurred the seat of injury in the brain or cord can frequently be determined by the situation and extent of the paralysis spinal cord—extending down from the medulla through the spinal column is the cord its length from the foramen magnum where it begins down through the vertebræ to the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra where it ends in a very fine threadlike process with no special function called the filum terminale is to inches just before it ends a number of nerves are given off in a taillike expansion known as the cauda equina or horse’s tail it is not uniform throughout its length but presents two enlargements a cervical enlargement in the lower cervical region and a lumbar enlargement in the lower dorsal region where the nerves are given off to the arms and legs respectively the membranes are the same as those of the brain and are continuous with them but here the dura mater is not attached to the bony walls enclosing it for the cord does not fit closely into the canal but is as it were suspended in it the subarachnoid space communicates with the ventricles of the brain by the foramen of majendie and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid for the protection of the cord in cerebrospinal

made it is found to have a pretty definite structure it is roughly circular and is divided by certain fissures of which the most important are the anterior and posterior median the latter being rather a dividing line or septum by them it is divided into halves connected by a small band in the middle called the commissure the white matter is exterior to the gray and is divided by it into four columns which again are divided into tracts according to certain groups of nerves that travel through them the most important tract is the direct pyramidal tract in the anterior column the gray matter is arranged in the form of a letter h practically consisting of two lateral halves more or less crescentic in outline connected by a narrow band the gray commissure each half is divided into two horns the anterior toward the front of the cord and the posterior toward the back the former being generally much thicker and heavier than the latter the structure of the gray and pg of the white matter is essentially the same as in the brain but the proportion varies in different parts of the cord the white predominating in the cervical region and the gray being much better developed in the lumbar

been located though the function of many parts the so called silent areas are still in obscurity the motor center that is the center for motion of the skeletal muscles is situated about the fissure of rolando and is divided into three parts one for the legs one for the face and one for the arms the one for the legs being uppermost and the others below in the order mentioned fibers from these cells extend down through the brain and cord to the muscles the fibers being collected into wellrecognized bundles and the whole known as the motor tract there may be one long fiber from a cell in the brain down through most of the cord or there may be a succession of shorter fibers that are not actually connected but are in close contact with each other in the upper pons the fibers for the face cross to the opposite side while the rest keep on down through the medulla and as they emerge from the medulla they too cross to the other side and keep on down in the crossed pyramidal tract a few fibers do not cross but come down the direct pyramidal tract which however disappears part way down the crossed pyramidal tract is the true motor tract and in it the fibers are continually sending branches to the cells in the gray matter where they connect with the anterior horn the anatomy of the sensory tract is not so well understood by it impulses are sent to the brain by the peripheral organs practically the surface of the body the sensory fibers connect with the sensory cells in the posterior horn from which fibers are sent to the brain practically the reverse of motor action there are three chief sensory tracts which are supposed to transmit different sensations one pain one muscular sensations and the third sensations of touch all these tracts of which the chief is the direct cerebellar tract in passing up the cord pass to the opposite side at different levels and then go on to the cortex of the brainpg  the action of the nerves is similar to reflex action only that an effort of will is needed to send an impulse from the brain it is by the help of the brain along this line that an infinity of artificial reflexes or habits is acquired for which volition is needed in the beginning but which are later done unconsciously herein lie the possibilities of all education the brain and spinal cord work together the cord acting as a medium between the brain in which all the higher psychical processes such as will thought etc originate and the muscular apparatus the cord however has some action entirely independent of the brain as is seen in reflex action this action is entirely involuntary so that the cord is sometimes spoken of as the seat of involuntary action commonly called reflex action all unconscious acts are reflex acts as when the hand is drawn away from a hot iron if an impulse is sent along one of the sensory fibers it enters the cord through the posterior horn where its nerve cell is found then through some connection between the nerve cell of the sensory fiber and that of the motor fiber the impulse is transmitted to the motor cell and another impulse is sent out of the cord along the motor fiber of the nerve to the muscle one of the commonest reflexes is the kneejerk reflex action is important because the reflexes are interfered with delayed destroyed or increased in different diseases the time normally required for a reflex act is very brief that for the kneejerk being about three onehundredths of a second the nerves of the head known as the cranial nerves arise from the brain while the rest of the body is supplied by the spinal nerves which come off at intervals from the spinal cord the cranial nerves consist of twelve pairs the olfactory or nerve of smell the optic or nerve of sight the motor oculi the patheticus which controls the eye the trigeminus or trifacial a nerve of general sensation motion and taste the abducens a motor nerve the pg facial nerve of the face ear palate and tongue the auditory or nerve of hearing the glossopharyngeal nerve of sensation and taste the pneumogastric or vagus which is both motor and sensory and governs respiration the heart and the stomach the spinal accessory to the muscles of the soft palate and the hypoglossal the motor nerve to the tongue the spinal nerves also are arranged in pairs eight cervical pairs twelve dorsal or thoracic five lumbar five sacral and one coccygeal these titles denoting their point of origin near the vertebra of the same name each of these nerves arises by two roots an anterior motor root from the anterior horn of gray matter and a posterior sensory root from the posterior horn the latter having a ganglion upon it after emerging from the cord the two roots unite to form the nerve that the nerve may contain both motor and sensory fibers the motor fibers are called efferent because they carry impulses from the cord while the sensory are called afferent because they carry impulses back to the cord after leaving the cord the nerves unite to form plexuses which again divide into various nerve trunks and are distributed to the muscles the first cervical nerves pass out of the spinal column above the first cervical vertebra and the other cervical nerves below that and the succeeding vertebræ while the other spinal nerves emerge each below the corresponding vertebra as the first dorsal below the first dorsal vertebra etc after emerging they break up into a large anterior division and a small posterior division the posterior branches supplying the spine and the dorsal muscles and skin the anterior the rest of the trunk and the limbs the cervical plexus is formed by the anterior divisions of the first four cervical nerves the brachial plexus by the last four cervical and the first dorsal or thoracic nerves the lumbar plexus by the four upper lumbar and the sacral plexus by the last lumbar and the four upper sacral nervespg  the only important branch of any of the four upper cervical nerves which in general supply the neck and shoulders is the phrenic which is distributed to the pericardium the pleuræ and the under surface of the diaphragm the brachial plexus as its name implies supplies the arms and has a number of important branches as the circumflex to the shoulder the musculocutaneous to the upper arm the elbowjoint and the outer surface of the forearm the internal cutaneous to the inner side of the arm the median to the pronators and flexors and the fingers on the radial side and the ulnar to the elbow and wristjoint the musculospiral runs down the spiral groove to the external condyle of the humerus or upper arm bone where it divides into the radial and the posterior interosseous the former going to the thumb and two adjacent fingers and the latter to the wristjoint and the muscles on the back of the forearm sometimes in fracture of the humerus the callus thrown out pinches the musculospiral and causes pain the dorsal or thoracic nerves supply the back with their posterior divisions and their anterior divisions are the intercostal nerves the lumbar nerves supply the abdomen pelvis and thigh the chief branches being the iliohypogastric to the abdomen and gluteal region the ilioinguinal to the inguinal region and scrotum the external cutaneous and genitocrural to the thigh and the obturator to the thigh and the hip and kneejoints the anterior crural descends beneath poupart’s ligament and divides into an anterior and a posterior division which supply the thigh muscles its branches going to the pelvis  fig —diagrammatic view of the sympathetic cord of the right side showing its connections with the principal cerebrospinal nerves and the main preaortic plexuses reduced from quain’s anatomy the sacral plexus supplies the organs of the pelvis the thigh and the leg its chief branches are the great sciatic the largest nerve in the body and the small sciatic which go to the buttocks and thigh the great sciatic runs down the back of the thigh and divides at the pg lower third of the thigh into the internal and external popliteal nerves the former of which passes along the back of the thigh to the knee where it becomes the posterior tibial which in turn divides at the ankle into the internal and external plantar the external popliteal pg descends along the outer side of the popliteal space and divides an inch below the head of the fibula into the anterior tibial which supplies the flexors and skin of the anklejoint and the musculocutaneous which sends branches to the skin of the lower leg and the dorsum of the foot the sympathetic system—joined to the cerebrospinal system by intervening cords is the sympathetic system this is made up of two series of ganglia one on either side of the spinal column connected by longitudinal bands and extending from the base of the skull to the coccyx they do not form an independent nervous system each ganglion which seems to resemble the motor cells of the spinal cord being connected by motor and sensory fibers with the cerebral system the sympathetic nerves are mostly gray nonmedullated fibers and are distributed to viscera secreting glands and bloodvessels whose movements are involuntary and feelings obtuse they form networks upon the heart and other viscera and send branches to the cranium to the organs of special sense there are three main plexuses the solar plexus behind the stomach which supplies the abdominal viscera; the hypogastric plexus in front of the prominence of the sacrum whose nerves go to the pelvic organs; and the cardiac plexus behind the aortic arch for the thoracic viscera over these nerves one has no control a blow in the region between the costal cartilages and below the sternum is a solar plexus blow and is very upsetting the sympathetic system serves to maintain vitality in all the important portions of the system and one of its important functions is to keep up communication between one part and another so that when any organ is affected the others will act accordingly and help out to the best of their ability pg  chapter vi the back fig — the spinal column church and peterson the spine—the trunk may be roughly divided into the back the chest or thorax the abdomen and the pelvis by the back is denoted the spinal column with its muscles bloodvessels etc and the spinal cord already described the spine or vertebral column which serves the double purpose of holding the body erect and of protecting the cord is usually about two feet two inches in length in its course there occur several curves which serve to give springiness and strength and with the intervertebral cartilages to mitigate the force of concussion from blows and falls the curve is convex forward in the cervical region convex backward in the dorsal forward in the lumbar and backward again in the sacral region there is most freedom of motion in the cervical region as is the case with the other bones the vertebræ are specially adapted in shape and size to the needs they are called upon to fill strength and flexibility with a minimum bulk a channel for the cord and passages for the numerous nerves and bloodvessels are some of the requirements which in combination they meet to an astonishing degree they are thirtythree in all and are divided into groups according to the region in which they occur seven cervical in the neck twelve dorsal or thoracic five lumbar five sacral and four coccygealpg  although the vertebræ of the different groups differ more or less in size and shape in accordance with the various demands of their positions they all have certain general characteristics each has a body two laminæ two pedicles two transverse processes and one spinous process the pedicles extend back from the body on either side and support two broad plates of bone the laminæ whose juncture at the back completes the spinal foramen for the passage of the cord at their juncture is the spinous process which can be felt beneath the skin while the transverse processes project from the juncture of the laminæ with the pedicles all the processes are for the attachment of muscles that move the spine the body is formed of cancellous bone with a compact layer outside transversely it is slightly oval while its upper and lower surfaces are flat except in the cervical region where the upper surface is concave laterally and the under convex laterally and concave from before back between the bodies are disks of fibrocartilage which increases motion and springiness the spinous process or spine is short in the cervical region long and directed downward in the dorsal region thick and projecting almost straight out in the lumbar region the pedicles are notched above and below so that pg when articulated the notches of two vertebræ join to form the intervertebral foramen for the outward passage of nerves and the inward passage of bloodvessels the distinguishing mark of the cervical vertebræ is the foramen in each transverse process through which the vertebral arteries run to the skull they are also smaller than the dorsal and lumbar vertebræ the dorsal vertebræ are distinguished by having on the transverse processes and on the body smooth articular surfaces called facets and demifacets for articulation with the ribs the lumbar vertebræ are the largest and heaviest and have the thickest spine by the time the sacral region is reached however the vertebræ have only a rudimentary spinous process moreover in adult age the sacral bones grow together and form one triangular bone the sacrum which has a broad base called the promontory of the sacrum and a blunt apex it is concave in front and convex behind and has an articulating surface for joining the pelvic bones in the case of the coccyx also the four original bones all rudimentary in character and supposed to be the survival of a tail grow together to form one bone together the sacrum and coccyx form the posterior wall of the true pelvis  fig —a type of vertebra leidy body; pedicle; lamina; spinal foramen; spinous process; transverse process; articular process  fig —the sacrum from before drawn by d gunn pg some of the dorsal vertebræ are peculiar in the arrangement of their facets and demifacets while among the cervical vertebræ are several whose peculiarities should be more carefully noted thus the first cervical vertebra or atlas supports the head and has practically no body the place of the body being taken by a narrow anterior arch of bone and an opening continuous with the spinal foramen into which the odontoid process of the axis fits being held in place by ligaments at either side on top is a facet for articulation with the occipital bone there is almost no spine the second vertebra or axis has surmounting the body the odontoid process with a facet in front for articulation with the atlas and one behind for the transverse ligament to move over the seventh cervical vertebra or vertebra prominens has a very long spinous process—hence name—to which is attached the ligamentum nuchæ it can be felt very distinctly on the living running from the skull down through the spinal column into the sacral vertebræ and formed by the joining of the spinal foramina of the individual vertebræ is an opening called the spinal canal which holds the cord the cord however stops practically at the first lumbar vertebra where it splits up into the cauda equina only the filum terminate extending farther down occasionally the laminæ do not form completely and the membranes of the cord may bulge out and form a tumor or the cord itself may come out also this generally occurs in the lumbar region where it is known as spina bifida if in case of fracture of a vertebra there is paralysis of the parts below due simply to the pressure of a fragment of bone upon the cord it may be completely cured by removal of the fragment if however the cord suffers injury the paralysis will remain humpback or pott’s disease is caused by the tubercle bacillus which eats away the bodies of the vertebræ so that the column caves in and the spinous processes are thrown out in a hump or kyphospg  fig —muscles of the right side of the head

largest and most important is the sternocleidomastoid muscle which has its origin on the upper part of the sternum and the inner third of the clavicle and is inserted into the mastoid process of the temporal bone it passes obliquely across the side of the neck and serves to flex the head to the side and to draw the face in the opposite direction when both muscles contract the head is flexed on the neck and the neck on the chest in wry neck or torticollis this muscle is constantly contracted the platysma myoides arises from the fascia over the pectoral deltoid and trapezius muscles and is inserted into the lower jaw the angle of the mouth and the loose tissue in the lower part of the face it pg wrinkles the skin of the neck and depresses the lower jaw in the cow and horse it is so highly developed that by it the skin can be contracted all over the body to drive off flies the rectus capitis anticus major arises from the third to the sixth cervical vertebræ and is inserted into the occipital bone serving to flex the head the scalenus muscles have their origin on the lower cervical vertebræ and are inserted into the first and second ribs thus aiding in the elevation of the ribs as well as in lateral flexion of the neck the head is held upright by the ligamentum nuchæ which rises from the external occipital protuberance and is inserted into the spinous processes of all the cervical vertebræ except the first muscles of the back—the chief back muscles are the trapezius and the latissimus dorsi which together cover in the back pretty thoroughly the trapezius arises from the occipital bone the ligamentum nuchæ and the spinous processes of the seventh cervical and all the dorsal vertebræ and is inserted into the outer third of the clavicle or collar bone and the acromion process and spine of the scapula or shoulder blade it is thus triangular in shape and covers in the neck and shoulders serving to draw the head back and to the side it overlaps the latissimus dorsi the latissimus dorsi has its origin by aponeurosis from the spinous processes of the six lower dorsal and all the lumbar and sacral vertebræ from the crest of the ilium or hip bone and from the three or four lower ribs swings across the side dwindling in size and is inserted by a small tendon into the bicipital groove of the humerus or upper arm bone thus covering in the part of the back not

part of the trunk in front and is a domeshaped cavity containing and protecting the heart and lungs its walls are formed by the dorsal vertebræ at the back the ribs at either side and the sternum and costal cartilages in front all well covered with muscles the floor is formed by the diaphragm through the upper opening of the chest pass the trachea the esophagus and many important vessels and nerves  fig —thorax anterior view ingals pg the shape of the chest may vary in disease thus in rickets there is the prominent “pigeon” breast and the rosary that is a bead at the juncture of each rib with the costal cartilage while in emphysema the chest is enlarged in all directions and barrelshaped in severe cases of lateral curvature it is distorted but may be improved by exercises the sternum—the sternum or breastbone is a long narrow bone and has three parts the manubrium or handle above the gladiolus or sword and the ensiform cartilage at the lower end on either side are notches for the costal cartilages; for the first seven ribs as well as the clavicle articulate with it except for some muscles along the edges it lies directly under the skin and the ridge between the manubrium and the gladiolus can be felt in the living a fact which assists in determining the position of the different ribs in cases of fracture as the second rib articulates at this point  fig —a and b typical ribs; c first rib; d twelfth rib head; neck; tuberosity; grooved edge; shaft; oval depression for costa cartilage the ribs—the ribs are twentyfour in number twelve on each side of which the upper seven which articulate with the sternum by individual cartilages are called true ribs the other five false ribs of the false ribs the upper three articulate indirectly with the sternum through the seventh cartilage with which their cartilages unite while the other two have their anterior extremities free and are pg called floating ribs all the ribs slope down toward the front and are by nature more freely movable in women than in men most of the ribs have a head divided by a little ridge into two facets for articulation with the dorsal vertebræ a flattened neck a tuberosity at the base of the neck with a facet for articulation with the transverse process of the vertebra below an angle and a shaft which is externally convex and is grooved on its lower edge for the intercostal vessels and nerve the first and second eleventh and twelfth ribs however are somewhat peculiar the first two being shorter flatter and rather broader than the rest and the first having only one facet on the head while the last two have only one facet on the head and no neck or tuberosity the costal cartilages serve to prolong the ribs and greatly increase the elasticity of the chest wall they grow longer down to the seventh and then decrease again in length the ribs except the first and second which are protected by the clavicle are frequently broken such a break causes pain in breathing and sometimes the end of a rib pierces the lung tissue and swelling all over the body results due to the presence of air caries or death of the rib is also frequent fracture of the sternum occurs occasionally generally from direct force as from a blow with the knee in football and there may be dislocation between the manubrium and gladiolus muscles of the chest—the spaces between the ribs from the tubercle of the rib behind to the cartilage in front are filled by the external intercostal muscles which pass downward and forward from the lower border of one rib to the upper border of the one below there are therefore eleven pairs of these muscles there are also eleven pairs of the internal intercostals which commence at the sternum and extend back to the angle of the rib these extend downward and backward the external intercostals raise and evert the ribs in inspiration the internal depress and invert them in expirationpg  the chief respiratory muscle however is the diaphragm a somewhat fanshaped muscle that forms the floor of the chest cavity it takes its origin from the ensiform cartilage the six or seven lower ribs and their cartilages and from the upper three or four lumbar vertebræ that is from the whole of the internal circumference of the thorax and is inserted into the central cordiform tendon it has several large and several small openings for the aorta the esophagus the venæ cavæ the thoracic duct and various nerves and its surfaces are covered by serous membranes by the two pleuræ and the pericardium above and by the peritoneum below it partially supports the heart and lungs convex toward the chest it becomes flattened in contraction and so increases the capacity of the chest it aids in all expulsive acts as sneezing coughing

of the chest are the intercostal branches of the subclavian and the thoracic aorta the phrenic mediastinal and intercostal branches of the internal mammary and the thoracic branches of the axillary the nerves are the intercostals and phrenics mammary glands—on the outside of the chest walls lodged in the fascia of the pectoral muscles are the mammary glands accessory organs of the generative system they exist in both sexes but are only rudimentary in the male in the female they are small before puberty but enlarge as the generative organs become more completely developed forming two hemispherical eminences one on either side between the third and seventh ribs during pregnancy they increase once more in size preparatory to the secretion of the milk and in old age they atrophy from the middle projects a small pinkishbrown conical eminence the nipple surrounded by a paler area the areola after the second month of pregnancy both nipple and areola become darker in color a point of great diagnostic value in early pregnancy the mammary glands themselves consist of lobules of gland tissue with a central lactiferous tubule the lobules being gathered into lobes with fatty tissue between from the juncture of these tubules result fifteen or twenty excretory ducts the tubuli lactiferi which converge toward the areola beneath the nipple they dilate forming the ampullæ and then contract again to pass out through the nipple as straight tubes breast abscess occurs most commonly in nursing mothers as where a part is most active there is most danger of abscess many benign tumors of the breast as the fibrous tumors occur and are especially common in young women if a fibrous tumor is allowed to develop it may become cancerous cancer however generally occurs after the age of forty and is usually due to some irritation as to a blow from a ball the arteries of the breasts are the thoracic branches of the axillary the intercostal and the internal mammary the nerves are from the thoracic cutaneous pg  chapter viii the heart and circulation the heart—shielded within the chest are as has been said the heart and lungs the heart lies on the left side behind the sternum and the cartilages of the fourth to seventh ribs in a closed conical membranous sac the pericardium which is attached by its base to the central tendon of the diaphragm and whose point extends up between the pleuræ of the lungs this sac has an external fibrous layer and an internal serous layer that is reflected back over the heart itself pg forming a closed sac within which a thin fluid is secreted

composed of cardiac muscle a combination of smooth and striated fibers found nowhere else in the body it lies obliquely base up between the lungs suspended by the great bloodvessels and with the apex directed downward forward and to the left the apex beat being normally felt in the fifth intercostal space one inch inside and two inches below the left nipple in size it varies in different people and is generally smaller in women than in pg men on the average it is five inches long three and a half inches broad and two inches thick a man’s heart usually weighs about eleven ounces and that of a woman nine ounces it never leaks except from disease and such leakage is fatal the cavities—the heart contains four cavities two auricles above and two ventricles below with a longitudinal septum between the auricle and ventricle on the right and those on the left the posterior surface is largely made up of the left ventricle and the anterior of the right ventricle the right auricle which receives the blood from the general circulation has a capacity of about two fluid ounces and is larger than the left which receives the blood returning from the lungs though its walls are thinner of the ventricles the left is the larger and its walls are about three times as thick as those of the right for it has to send the blood all over the body all the cavities are lined with smooth transparent serous membrane the endocardium which is continuous with the intima of the great vessels  fig —orifices of the heart seen from above both the auricles and the great vessels being removed pa pulmonary artery and its semilunar valves; ao aorta and its valves; rav tricuspid and lav bicuspid valves; mv segments of mitral valve; lv segment of tricuspid valve huxley the valves—the opening from the auricle into the ventricle on either side is guarded on the ventral side by a valve formed of folds of endocardium the valve on the right side has three flaps or cusps pg and is called the tricuspid valve while that on the left has two flaps larger and thicker than those of the tricuspid and is known as the bicuspid or mitral valve the flaps of either valve are kept from being forced into the auricle in closing by fine tendinous cords the chordæ tendineæ which are attached to the columnæ carneæ muscular bands or columns projecting from the walls of the ventricle which contract and hold the chordæ tendineæ taut the opening into the pulmonary artery is from the posterior part of the right ventricle and is guarded by the semilunar or pulmonary valve while the aortic opening from the left ventricle is guarded by a similar valve the aortic valve the most important valve in the body all these valves are planned primarily to prevent regurgitation of the blood during contraction of the heart muscle pressure in the ventricle must exceed that in the arteries before the semilunar valves will open and the blood can be driven out just as the auriculoventricular valves remain closed until the pressure in the auricles exceeds that in the ventricles the heart beat is caused by the twisting of the heart upon its axis during contraction of the muscle normally it beats rhythmically and regularly whatever a person does at a rate of about seventytwo contractions to the minute in the adult to the regular cardiac cycle as it is called there are two periods the systole and the diastole the former representing the period of contraction of the ventricles when the blood is sent to the lungs and over the body and the latter representing the period of rest following the emptying of the ventricles during which they are refilled contraction of the heart occupies onefifth of the time of one beat dilatation twofifths and the pause twofifths there are really two systoles one of the auricles and one of the ventricles but they come so close together that they are practically simultaneous so far as sound is concerned though they can be distinguished by sight during systole the tricuspid and mitral valves close sharply to prevent regurgitation pg into the auricles while the semilunar valves open to let the blood out the cardiac cycle is therefore as follows  fig —diagram of the circulation after kirke circulation—the blood after it has given off its oxygen and collected carbon dioxide returns to the heart through two main channels the superior and inferior venæ cavæ the former bringing the blood from the upper part of the body including the head neck and arms and the latter from the lower part below the diaphragm the two vessels empty along with the coronary sinus which is guarded by the coronary valve into the right auricle at the same time that they empty into this auricle the four pulmonary veins the only veins that carry arterial or oxygenated blood are emptying the fresh blood pg from the lungs into the left auricle when both auricles are full they contract and send the blood into the ventricles the auricular systole as the blood comes through into the ventricles it probably comes around by the walls and closes the auriculoventricular valves though just how the valves close is not certain when the two ventricles are full they in turn contract the ventricular systole and the blood is forced out that in the right ventricle passing to the lungs for its new supply of oxygen through the pulmonary artery the only artery to carry venous blood and that from the left ventricle entering the aorta for general distribution through the body following the systole is a pause the diastole while the heart fills again  fig —the fetal circulation circulation in fetus—in the fetus there is direct communication between the two auricles through the foramen ovale which normally closes at birth though occasionally it remains open there is also communication between the pulmonary artery and the arch of the aorta through the ductus arteriosus the freshly oxidized blood comes to the fetus through the placenta from which it is brought along the umbilical cord in the umbilical vein to the liver and thence to the inferior vena cava where it mixes with the blood from the lower extremities by the inferior vena cava it is carried to the right auricle where the eustachian valve—a valve between the inferior vena cava and the auriculoventricular opening larger in the fetus than in later life where it serves no special purpose—guides it across the auricle and through the foramen ovale to the left auricle from this auricle together with a small amount of blood from the lungs it goes to the left ventricle and is distributed by the aorta almost pg entirely to the head and upper extremities hence their large size and perfect development at birth returned from the upper extremities by the superior vena cava the blood enters the right auricle again and passing over the eustachian valve this time descends to the right ventricle from which the greater part passes by the pulmonary artery and the ductus arteriosus to the descending aorta though a small amount keeps on through the pulmonary artery to the lungs in the aorta it mixes with the blood from the left ventricle and part goes to supply the lower extremities though the greater part is carried back to the placenta through the two umbilical arteries the fact that the greater part of the blood traverses the liver accounts for its large size at birth while the lower extremities which receive for the most part blood that has already circulated through the upper extremities are of small size and imperfectly developed arteries—after birth the arterial blood for the general circulation leaves the heart by the aorta the main distributing artery of the body through this and its branches it is carried throughout the body in what with the return of the venous blood by the venæ cavæ and other smaller veins is known as the systemic circulation the aorta ascends from the left ventricle and arches backward to the left over the root of the left lung to descend along the spinal column at the left to the fourth lumbar vertebra about opposite the umbilicus where considerably diminished in size by the branches it has given off it divides into the two common iliacs for convenience its different parts are named according to their position the ascending aorta the arch of the aorta and the descending aorta the last being subdivided into the thoracic and the abdominal aorta  fig —the aortæ and their branches leidy from the ascending aorta come off the coronary arteries which supply the heart muscle itself as the coronary sinuses carry off the venous blood from the heart from the arch are given off the left common pg carotid and left subclavian and the innominate which divides into the right common carotid and right subclavian the common carotids pass up the neck behind the sternocleidomastoid muscles in a line from the sternoclavicular joint to a point midway between the mastoid process and the angle of the lower jaw and divide opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage into the internal and external carotids of which the former with its branches supplies the anterior part of the brain the eye and forehead and the latter the neck and face the subclavian is the artery of the upper extremity but its vertebral branch goes to the brain where with its fellow it forms the basilar artery whose branches together with the branches of the internal carotid form the circle of willis at the base of the brain other branches of the subclavian are the thyroid axis with branches to the neck and shoulders; the internal mammary with branches to the chest walls mediastinum and diaphragm such as the musculophrenic and superior epigastric; and the superior intercostal at the lower border of the first rib over which it passes the name axillary is substituted for subclavian while at the lower border of the axilla where it starts down the arm it is called the brachial artery at the elbow the brachial divides into the radial and ulnar arteries pg the axillary artery sends branches to the chest and shoulder and is more frequently injured than any other artery except the popliteal aneurism may occur in it and is very likely to occur in the thoracic aorta from the thoracic aorta branches go to various of the chest contents while the abdominal aorta supplies the abdominal viscera among the branches of the abdominal aorta are the celiac axis which has a gastric an hepatic and a splenic branch; the superior and inferior mesenteric to the intestines; the renal; the suprarenal; the spermatic or ovarian; the inferior phrenic; and the lumbar the common iliacs divide at the upper edge of the sacrum into the external and internal iliacs of which the latter with its branches supplies the walls and viscera of the pelvis and the inner part of the thigh the external iliac and its branches go to the thigh leg and foot veins—of the veins few need be mentioned by name the deep veins have the same names as the arteries they accompany though there are two innominate veins where there is only one innominate artery the subclavian and internal jugular veins on either side joining to form an innominate vein and the two innominates in turn forming the superior vena cava of the superficial veins the external and internal jugular correspond to the common carotid arteries and return the blood from the head and face the external jugular vein is important because it is the largest superficial vein in the neck and is often cut in suicide the median vein is found at the bend of the elbow and is used in letting blood and in giving salt solution while the basilic is on the inner side and the median cephalic on the outer side of the upper arm varicosity often occurs in the internal or long saphenous and the external or short saphenous in the leg the inferior vena cava is formed by the juncture of the two common iliac veins portal circulation—the portal system of veins includes four pg large trunks which collect the blood from the viscera of digestion the superior and inferior mesenteric veins from the intestines the splenic vein from the spleen and the gastric from the stomach these join together to form the portal vein the only vein that breaks up into capillaries this divides and ramifies through the liver whence it emerges as the hepatic veins the whole is known as the portal circulation pulmonary circulation—of the pulmonary circulation and its vessels a few words might also be said the pulmonary artery which carries the blood from the right ventricle to the lungs is only about two inches long and divides into a right and a left pulmonary artery which pierce the pericardium and go to their respective lungs the right one is the larger and longer for it has farther to go and gives off a branch to supply the third lobe of the right lung the vessels finally divide and subdivide terminating in the pulmonary capillaries the venous capillaries then gather together to form a main vein in each lobule these veins uniting into two trunks for each lung the pulmonary veins which empty into the left auricle nerves of heart—the muscular fibers of the heart have the power of rhythmical contraction independent nerve centers or ganglia are also found in the muscular walls and influence the mechanism of the heart especially the acceleratory mechanism thus in some of the lower animals the heart can be removed from the body and if placed in normal salt solution will go on beating for some time the heart is controlled however by two nerves the vagus or pneumogastric and the sympathetic of these the vagus is the inhibitory mechanism it acts as a check and makes the heart’s action regular and rhythmic if it is cut the action of the heart becomes very rapid and irregular the sympathetic is the acceleratory mechanism when the vagus alone is stimulated it first slows then stops the heart for it weakens the systole and prolongs diastole acceleration follows stimulation of the pg sympathetic both the rapidity and the force of the beat being increased when a person faints from a blow in the abdomen it is because the pneumogastric is affected and inhibits the action of the heart the work of the heart is very dependent upon its nervous condition and functional diseases of the heart are practically wholly due to nervous derangement heart sounds—through the stethoscope two heart sounds may be heard they are known as the first and second sounds the first is a soft rushing sound stronger and louder than the other and is caused in part by the contraction of the muscle itself when the blood is forced out and in part by the closure of the auriculoventricular valves the second sound is shorter and sharper a snap and is caused by the closure of the semilunar valves when the contraction of the ventricles ceases and they begin to refill in certain diseased conditions where the edges of the valves are roughened they do not snap properly and the sound varies from the normal the heart beat—the rate of the heart beat is proportionate to the size of the person and increases in rapidity as the size diminishes if the ear is placed over the abdomen of a pregnant woman the heart of the fetus can be heard beating very rapidly in prolonged labor it may become more rapid or very faint and warn the doctor that something should be done the usual rate of the pulse in the fetus is to times a minute though it varies with size and sex at birth it drops to to ; for the first year it is to ; for the second year to ; for the third year to ; from the seventh to the fourteenth years to ; from the fourteenth to the twentyfirst years to ; from twentyone to sixty to in old age it rises a little and is to the rate is higher in the average woman than in the average man and increases with exercise with increase of temperature and in high altitudes where the atmospheric pressure is less at each beat of the heart from four to six ounces of blood are expelled pg into the pulmonary artery and the aorta and in or beats all the blood in the body passes through the heart the power exerted by the heart every minute in thus driving the blood upon its course has been estimated as sufficient to raise its own weight threequarters of a pound the height of the washington monument or meters; for the ventricles have to force the blood into vessels already full factors affecting circulation—there are three main factors in the circulation the systole which gives the blood its first impulse; the peripheral resistance in the capillaries which serves to hold it in check slowing the circulation and doing away with its rhythmic character and the elasticity of the walls of the arteries if a ligature is tied about an artery there is a swelling on the side toward the heart while in the case of a vein the swelling is on the side away from the heart that is the swelling is in either case on the side from which the blood comes when an artery is cut however the blood comes out rhythmically in spurts though from a cut vein it oozes slowly and regularly for the blood is pumped out by the heart rhythmically and its rhythmic beating against the walls of the artery is felt in the pulse which follows slightly after the beat of the heart itself the pulse is due to the fact that the vessels into which the blood is forced are already full this causes a local dilation at the beginning of the artery which passes with diminishing force along its entire length the distention being due to the fact that more force is needed to drive the blood through the small arteries and capillaries than to stretch the elastic walls of the aorta and the large arteries it is this elastic character of the arteries that makes the blood flow constant for otherwise the blood would come intermittently in jets as it is pumped from the heart the elastic walls of the vessels however offer a certain resistance to the pumping of the fluid through them and at the same time by relaxing between whiles allow a certain amount of fluid to be retained in them so that they continue full and the flow pg is more or less constant the insufficient outlet also helps to make the flow constant by the time the blood reaches the veins its rhythmic character has been done away with but though there are no elastic walls in the veins it still has force enough after the slowing in the capillaries to return to the heart in this it is aided to a certain extent by the valves and by the action of the skeletal muscles as they contract and expand especially in the arms and legs where the blood runs perpendicularly and there is a high column to be supported there are also more veins than arteries each large artery having two large veins the venæ comites to help get the blood back to the heart and the veins anastomose freely thus if the blood cannot get back by one channel it does by another in parts like the brain where it is very important that there should be no compression since any disturbance of circulation would lead to serious results the vessels are enclosed in thick walls and in the liver through which all the blood passes and where compression is sure to cause trouble the veins are simply caverns carved out in the organ and have no walls they lie open when the organ is opened varicose veins are the result of valves giving way through inherited weakness or disease so that others have an unduly large weight to support the pulse—the pulse wave is characterized by a quick rise and a slow fall though this cannot ordinarily be distinguished by the finger in some slow fevers however the fall is very long and distinct ripples can be felt this is known as the dicrotic pulse with age the arterial walls grow stiffer and more rigid and less adapted to their work in certain cases of heart disease the heart does not transmit all the beats to the pulse and to get the true rate the heart must be listened to the rate at which the pulse wave travels varies with the size of the artery and the force of the heart beat but is about to feet a second the flow is most rapid in the arteries because they are nearest pg the heart where the pressure is greatest and slowest in the capillaries where the area is greatest the sectional area of the capillaries known as the peripheral area because it is farthest from the heart being larger than that of the large arteries thus rapidity of flow varies with pressure and with area blood pressure—liquids moreover are incompressible and exert pressure on the walls of the tubes through which they pass the amount of pressure depends upon the inflow and outflow increasing directly with the inflow and inversely with the outflow that is the smaller the outlet the greater the pressure and vice versa the pressure is also greatest nearest to the inflow and gradually decreases with distance until at the point of outflow there is practically no pressure so in the arteries the blood pressure is greatest in the large vessels nearer the heart and gradually decreases as they branch into smaller and smaller vessels in passing through the capillaries owing to their small size and resultant increased friction the blood meets with more resistance the peripheral resistance and this resistance usually regulates the pressure in the arteries the greater the peripheral resistance as a rule the greater the arterial pressure the pressure in the capillaries is very slight and in the veins there is practically no pressure in fact in the large veins near the heart the pressure is negative and the blood is almost sucked into the heart pressure then is greatest in the arteries and least in the veins while the rate of flow is fastest in the arteries— to millimeters a second—and slowest in the capillaries— millimeters a second—being a little faster again in the veins— millimeters a second blood pressure is gauged by opening a vessel and inserting a manometer the pressure being determined by the height to which the mercury is raised in man the pressure in the arteries is to pg millimeters it is considerably heightened during inspiration by the increased pressure of the lungs on the heart and great vessels in pericarditis the opposite is true when the blood pressure is high the pulse is small and travels fast because the wall of the artery is already highly stretched such a pulse is hard and incompressible a large pulse occurs where the heart is strong and the pressure is low owing to peripheral dilatation a lowpressure pulse is soft and compressible if the heart beat is weak a slow pulse is generally stronger than a rapid one the nerve supply of the bloodvessels comes from the spinal cord through the vasomotor nerves which are connected with the sympathetic system and are distributed to the smooth muscle fibers of the vessels they are of two classes the vasoconstrictors which diminish the lumen of the vessels and the vasodilators which increase the size of the vessels by these nerves the general tone of the arteries is kept up they are distributed chiefly to vessels in the skin and in the abdominal organs and the constrictors are probably the more important when the constrictors are stimulated three phenomena occur diminished flow through the vessel due to its diminished size; increased general arterial pressure and increased flow through the other arteries when the dilators are stimulated the opposite effect is produced the flow through the vessel is increased; there is decreased arterial pressure and there is decreased flow through the other arteries the palor of fright is due to the action of the vasoconstrictor nerves of the face and blushing to the action of the vasodilators heat stimulates the vasodilators so that more blood goes to the skin perspiration begins and the body is cooled by evaporation cold stimulates the vasoconstrictors and the blood is kept within the body where it cannot cool if a part has too much blood an impulse passes by the vasoconstrictors to lessen the supply while if pg more blood is needed a message goes to the central nervous system and an impulse passes by the vasodilators to flush the organ the more active a part is in functioning the greater the number of capillaries except in the brain which has only large vessels the vessels of the intestines contain much blood and are capable of containing all the blood in the body the blood—the blood itself which thus circulates through the body carrying nutrition to the tissues and removing waste is a complex fluid of a bright red color its amount has been calculated to be about onethirteenth of the body weight onefourth of it is generally in the heart lungs and large arteries and veins onefourth in the liver onefourth in the skeletal muscles and onefourth variously distributed through the other organs if there is too little blood the vital processes cannot go on as they should while too great a supply causes weakness rather than strength so the tendency is to keep the amount constant and any blood added is disposed of and any blood lost is replaced in starvation it is the last tissue to be used up for on it the life of the other tissues depends composition—in composition the blood is practically the same in all arteries and fundamentally the same everywhere but in passing through certain organs certain substances are added to or taken from it so that its character changes more or less thus it varies somewhat in composition in different parts of the body as in the liver and kidneys it has five main functions the conveying of fuel from the digestive tract to the tissues or force production; the carrying of oxygen to the tissues; the carrying of tissuebuilding materials or tissue building; the distribution of heat; and the removal of waste products the blood is slightly alkaline in reaction of a saltish taste and has a specific gravity of its temperature is about ° fahrenheit or ° centigrade it is made up of two parts the plasma or fluid pg portion and the corpuscles or solid portion the plasma again which is transparent and almost colorless consists of two materials the blood serum and fibrin fibrin does not exist as such in the body nor in freshly shed blood but there is a substance named fibrinogen which is worked on by another substance the fibrin ferment to form fibrin both fibrin ferment and fibrinogen can be isolated from the blood coagulability—in the body the blood is perfectly fluid and under normal conditions does not coagulate but though fluid when first shed upon standing it gradually becomes viscid that is in two or three minutes then jellylike in five to ten minutes and grows firmer and firmer until there finally appears around this jellylike mass or clot a yellowish fluid the serum the clot is made up of the corpuscles and fibrin if some blood is drawn and set on ice until the corpuscles settle the plasma can then be drawn off and after it has stood a while in a warm place coagulation will take place a mass of fibrin forming in the middle it takes from one to two hours for clotting to be complete in very slow clotting at a low temperature the white corpuscles appear in a layer on top of the clot the buffy coat of fibrin little is known but its formation is the most important step in clotting as its presence is absolutely essential if it is removed by whipping the blood will not clot it is a delicate stringy material elastic and contractile and contains certain salts of lime and magnesium upon whose presence its power of coagulation depends the coagulability of blood differs in different people and is occasionally so little as to make operation dangerous the most favorable temperature for clotting is that of the body extreme heat preventing it and cold delaying it that the blood does not clot in the body must be due to some relation between the blood and the walls of the arteries and veins that prevents it just as the walls of the stomach are not digested by the juices secreted though pg coagulation does not normally take place in the body it does take place when a bloodvessel is injured or when the blood comes in contact with the air a wise provision of nature as otherwise the tendency would be for bleeding to go on indefinitely after injury the greater the surface with which the blood comes in contact the more quickly it clots injury to the vessel wall itself is necessary; the endothelium must be cracked under extreme injury the muscular coat of the vessel undergoes spasmodic contraction and partially closes it hence a wound caused by tearing is less likely to bleed than one due to cutting the valves of the heart which are covered with endothelium are frequently the seat of fibrin coagulation bits of the fibrin thus formed giving rise to conditions in various kinds of heart trouble or the bits of fibrin float in the blood and perhaps lodge in the small vessels of the brain and cause apoplexy pus in various parts of the body will set up coagulation in nearby arteries in fact the presence of any foreign substance in the blood causes clotting  fig —cells of blood a colored bloodcorpuscles seen on the flat; b on edge; c in rouleau; d blood platelets leroy bloodcorpuscles—the solid parts of the blood are the red corpuscles the white corpuscles and the blood plaques or plates it is to the red corpuscles or erythrocytes which number about to the cubic millimeter of blood that the color of the blood is due under the microscope they appear as small spherical biconcave pg discs with a slightly greenishyellow color which have a tendency to form in rouleaux they are homogeneous with no limiting membrane and are made up of a fine network of tissue the stroma in which is embedded the hemoglobin or coloring matter this hemoglobin is a crystalline body and the most complex substance known to chemists the corpuscles are very flexible and can squeeze through small apertures as in the tiny capillaries and regain their shape they are probably formed chiefly in the red bone marrow at the ends of the bones which under the microscope shows red corpuscles in various stages of growth and also in the spleen for which no other use is known their function is to carry oxygen which forms a chemical combination though an extremely loose one with the hemoglobin as the tissues are more greedy of oxygen than is the hemoglobin they rob the corpuscles of it  fig —various forms of leucocytes a small lymphocyte; b large lymphocyte; c polymorphonuclear neutrophile; d eosinophile leroy the white corpuscles or leucocytes are much fewer in number about one to from to of the red the average number being to to the cubic millimeter they are larger than the red corpuscles colorless and spherical when at rest their structure is more definite there being a definite cell substance or protoplasm and one or more nuclei which vary more or less in shape and size the corpuscles are classed in accordance with these variations in the nuclei they are most numerous during digestion and are probably formed in the lymphatic system constantly passing from the lymphatics to the pg arteries and veins for they have the function of amœboid movement by which they not only wander from place to place in the blood keeping close to the sides of the vessels but pass through the walls of the capillaries probably between the cells which form their lining into the lymph spaces this is known as migration of the white corpuscles in inflammation they collect in the inflamed area to assist in allaying the inflammation by absorbing and carrying off its products for they carry waste products and destroy poisons acting as scavengers and protectors of the body when they are unsuccessful and the inflammation gets the better of them they become pus corpuscles besides the corpuscles there are seen floating in the blood small disklike substances with no special characteristics the blood plaques or plates whose function is unknown in anemia the red corpuscles are diminished and the white corpuscles and blood plaques increased in number after excessive bleeding normal salt solution is injected subcutaneously or by rectum as being nearly equivalent to blood serum in composition and the renewal of the solid elements is left to time the length of time needed for their restoration is about a week except in the case of the hemoglobin which takes longer pg  chapter ix the lungs and respiration besides the heart and the great vessels the chest contains the lungs the chief organ of respiration which with the rest of the respiratory system will now be treated the nose and mouth through which the air first enters the body have already been spoken of from them the air passes through the larynx to the trachea thence to the bronchi and so to the lungs where the supply of oxygen for the tissues is taken from the air by the hemoglobin of the blood the larynx—the larynx lies in front of the pharynx at the upper and fore part of the neck where it causes a considerable projection known as adam’s apple it is a triangular box base up flattened at the back in front and at the sides but becoming cylindrical below above it opens into the bottom of the pharynx and below into the trachea it is lined with mucous membrane its opening at the base of the tongue is closed during swallowing by a little doorlike valve of fibrocartilage the epiglottis to prevent the entrance of food nine cartilages go to make up the larynx of which the most important are the thyroid and cricoid cartilages and the epiglottis already mentioned the thyroid is the largest and is open behind its two alæ or wings meeting in an acute angle in front and forming the adam’s apple always more prominent in the male than in the female it is attached above to the hyoid bone and has cornua or horns on either side top and bottom the cricoid or ringlike cartilage resembles a seal ring with the stone placed posteriorly it is stronger than the pg thyroid and forms the lower part of the cavity of the larynx inside and resting on the upper border of the cricoid are the two smaller arytenoid or pitcherlike cartilages pyramidal in shape and surmounting these again the two cornicula laryngis the two cuneiform cartilages are in the free borders of the folds of mucous membrane which extend from the apex of the arytenoids to the sides of the epiglottis numerous small muscles serve to bind these various cartilages together at the angle of the thyroid cartilage in front are attached the epiglottis at the top and just below that the superior or false vocal cords two folds of mucous membrane enclosing the superior thyroarytenoid ligaments lower still are found the inferior or true vocal cords which are formed by the inferior thyroarytenoid ligaments covered with a thin tightly fitting mucous membrane both sets of vocal cords as well as the epiglottis may be seen by means of a head and a throat mirror between the true vocal cords is a narrow triangular interval called the glottis it is by means of the vibrations of these cords that sound is produced the false vocal cords cannot produce sound though they can modify it indirectly quality of voice as treble base etc depends upon the size of the larynx and the length and elasticity of the vocal cords modulation is produced by changing the form of the cavity of the mouth and nose in whispering the lips take the place of the vocal cords and produce sound by the vibration of their muscular walls instead of tracheotomy laryngotomy is sometimes done in the depression between the thyroid and the cricoid which may be felt on the living foreign bodies sometimes get into the larynx and have to be removed or the mucous membrane may become inflamed causing laryngitis syphilis attacks the larynx and tuberculosis and cancer of the larynx occur these last two being generally fatal edema of the glottis may also occurpg  fig —the larynx trachea and bronchi after sobotta the trachea—the trachea is a membranous tube extending down from the larynx for about four and a half inches to the fourth or fifth dorsal vertebra where it divides into the right and left bronchi it is formed of sixteen to twenty imperfect cartilaginous rings open behind enclosed in a double elastic fibrous membrane and is lined with ciliated mucous membrane the rings are for strength and in the interval at the back where they are wanting there is one layer of longitudinal and another of transverse unstriped muscle fibers the passage is kept clear by the action of the cilia which sweep up and out any particles of dust that become entangled in the mucus tracheotomy is generally done about one inch below the cricoid pg just above the sternal notch incision being made through the cartilage  fig —the upper thorax of a child eight years old showing the thyroid and thymus glands sobotta extending up on either side of the upper trachea in the neck are the two lobes of the thyroid gland the isthmus which connects the lobes covering the trachea below anteriorly the function of the gland is obscure but it has an internal secretion of great importance in the metabolic processes its removal or disease is followed by general disturbances of mind and body the injection of thyroid extract has proved effective as treatment in goiter the gland becomes enlarged the thymus gland lies below the thyroid gland at birth in front of and at the sides of the trachea and runs down behind the sternum it is largest at the end of the second year after which it atrophies being almost absent at puberty it too is ductless and its function is not well understoodpg  the bronchi—the two bronchi of which the right is the larger and shorter resemble the trachea in structure as they enter the root of the lung they divide the right into three and the left into two branches one for each lobe after which they divide and subdivide the bronchioles becoming smaller and smaller and finally ending in the infundibula pouchlike places lined with air cells in which cilia keep the air in motion as they grow smaller the bronchioles gradually become wholly membranous  fig —relation of lungs to other thoracic organs ingals the lungs—the lungs themselves two in number lie each in a serous sac or pleura similar in structure to the pericardium and serving a like purpose the outer layer of the pleura is reflected back over the thoracic wall and diaphragm there is no pleural cavity in health between the two layers of the pleura the two surfaces being in close contact though moistened with lymph to prevent friction during pg respiration in inflammation of the pleuræ or pleurisy they become thickened and roughened and friction results as is shown by the sounds heard through the stethoscope friction causes effusion and fluid collects this generally absorbs again but occasionally the serous fluid becomes pustular and empyema results in front between the two pleuræ which are wholly separate is the mediastinal space or mediastinum which extends from the sternum to the spinal column and contains all the thoracic viscera except the lungs and heart that is the trachea esophagus thoracic duct and many large vessels and nerves  fig —diagrammatic representation of the termination of a bronchial tube in a group of infundibula b bronchial tube; lb bronchiole; a atrium; i infundibulum; c alveoli de nancrede roughly speaking the lungs begin at the sternoclavicular articulation above the apex coming up above the level of the first rib and extend downward together to the fourth cartilage where the lower margins gradually separate the lowest lung limit being the eleventh rib in the vertebral region each lung is conical the apices extend upward and the bases which are broad and concave rest upon the diaphragm the right lung is divided by a fissure into three lobes the left into two the root consists of a bronchus and pulmonary arteries veins lymphatics and nerves the tissue itself is composed of an aggregation of lobules each consisting of a terminal bronchiole with its alveoli pg or air cells bloodvessels and nerves a lung in miniature the blind pouches which the air cells surround are called infundibula and are separated by delicate membranous septa in which lie the capillaries of the pulmonary artery thus exposing the blood to the air on two sides the lung itself is supplied by the bronchial arteries from the thoracic aorta and by branches of the sympathetic and pneumogastric nerves at birth the lungs are pinkishwhite in color but in later life they are marked with slatecolored patches due to the deposit in the lung tissue of particles of dirt breathed in they are light spongy and highly elastic and will float in water crepitating upon pressure owing to the air in the tissue at birth also the lungs are solid so that the first air has to overcome adhesions between the collapsed walls of the bronchioles and air sacs but after they are thus gradually unfolded in that they are of extensible material and open to the air above atmospheric pressure from within keeps them distended to the full extent of the chest which is air tight they never collapse afterwards unless puncture of the chest wall as in stabbing causes collapse in which case the lung shrivels into a small ball respiration—that the organic materials used by the body as food may give up their energy they must be broken up and for this oxygen is needed the supply of oxygen for the purpose is brought to the tissues by the blood which acquires it in the lungs and the waste product of combustion carbon dioxide is carried off in the same manner the lungs are therefore adapted to take in large quantities of air and to keep up a rapid exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood this process of supplying oxygen to the tissues and of removing carbon dioxide and other waste is ordinarily an involuntary act though it can be regulated temporarily and is known as respiration or breathing there are two periods to respiration inspiration or the drawing pg in of air and expiration or the expulsion of air from the lungs the former process being a little shorter than the latter a pause follows each expiration before there is another inspiration at birth the normal rate of respiration is but it grows slower as the child grows older being at the age of five or six while in the adult it averages to times a minute it is slower during sleep and more rapid during physical activity the average amount of air taken in with every inspiration is cubic inches and the minimum air space per individual should be cubic feet per hour breathing is of two kinds diaphragmatic or abdominal and chest or rib breathing the former usually being more pronounced in men than in women probably because of centuries of tight dressing on the part of the latter as a rule however both diaphragm and ribs come into play; for in inspiration which is an active movement the thorax becomes enlarged from before backward laterally and vertically the ribs are raised by the external intercostals chiefly though the internal intercostals aid somewhat and swinging out upon the vertebræ widen the chest as well as deepen it the diaphragm which is domelike when relaxed becomes flattened in contraction and so increases the size of the chest from above downward as the chest enlarges the lungs expand the air in them becomes rarefied and more air rushes in when the lungs are full they relax and the muscles relax after their contraction so that expiration is a passive movement due largely to the elastic relaxation of lungs and muscles the air being driven out by the lessened capacity of the lungs difficult breathing—in heart and lung troubles where too little oxygen is carried to the tissues dyspnœa or difficult breathing results and may even advance to asphyxia a condition in which no air is obtained in difficult or labored respiration the pectoral muscles are used in inspiration and the scaleni which pass from the vertebræ pg of the neck to the sternum develop and become powerful the levatores of the ribs may also assist and even the muscles of the neck and arms may help out while in forced expiration the abdominal muscles are called into play the glottis opens and closes rhythmically as the air enters and leaves the lungs and the nostrils add their mite in the struggle for oxygen finally there may be scarcely a muscle in the body that is not striving to aid the respiration and general convulsions may result followed by exhaustion and death air—in ordinary breathing the lungs are not used to their full capacity and the air ordinarily used is known as tidal air in forced inspiration the lungs are filled to their fullest extent and the air then taken in in excess of the tidal air is known as complemental air in like manner the difference between the air ordinarily breathed out and that breathed out in forced expiration is known as supplemental air the sum of these three is the vital capacity of the lungs while beyond this there is probably some air that is never expelled the stationary or residual air respiratory sounds—the entrance and exit of the air is accompanied by respiratory sounds or murmurs which vary according to their position in the trachea the bronchi or the bronchioles and are modified in diseases of the lungs and bronchi when they are often called râles changes in air in lungs—in passing through the nose and the rest of the respiratory tract the air is warmed to body temperature and saturated with moisture after its entrance into the lungs various changes take place in it through the mingling of the tidal with the residual air thus it gives up about or per cent of its oxygen and acquires some per cent additional carbon dioxide while the amount of nitrogen remains about the same by its giving up more oxygen than it receives carbon dioxide its volume is slightly diminished pg exhaled air also contains traces of ammonia and certain organic matters generally the results of decomposition which give a bad odor to the breath and are more dangerous in a close room than the mere lack of oxygen or the presence of carbon dioxide indeed the amount of oxygen may be very much diminished being reduced even to or per cent instead of the normal per cent without being noticed or giving rise to any immediate bad results yet the importance of ventilation is very evident effect on blood—respiration causes changes also in the blood the venous blood being purple and the arterial bright red this difference in color is due to the absence or presence of oxygen which is not absorbed or dissolved by the blood but forms a rather unstable compound oxyhemoglobin with the hemoglobin of the blood as the oxygen is removed in the passage of the blood through the body there results in venous blood reduced hemoglobin which is of a purplish color upon exposure to the air however it absorbs oxygen once more and resumes its scarlet color if carbon monoxide gets into the blood as in cases of gas poisoning it drives off the oxygen and forms a more stable compound with the hemoglobin whence the difficulty in restoring a person so poisoned nervous mechanism—nervously respiration is controlled in three ways by the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm; by some fibers of the vagus or pneumogastric and by the respiratory center in the bulbous portion of the spinal cord injury to the respiratory center means the ceasing of respiration and death stimulation of the respiratory center seems to depend upon the character of the blood if it is well oxygenized the breathing is slow and quiet; if there is a lack of oxygen dyspnœa results probably certain chemical substances in the blood which are ordinarily rapidly burned up by the oxygen but pg which accumulate in its absence serve to stimulate the respiratory center thus adjusting the effort to get oxygen to the need of it respiration may be stopped by stimulating the mucous membrane of the nose as with strong ammonia variations—certain variations from the ordinary respiration might be mentioned here a deep inspiration followed by a long expiration is known as a sigh and a very deep inspiration through the mouth only as a yawn hiccough results from a sudden inspiratory contraction of the diaphragm during which the glottis is suddenly closed in sobbing the inspirations are short and rapid with a prompt closing of the glottis between both coughing and sneezing consist of a deep inspiration followed by complete closure of the glottis and then its sudden opening and the forcible expulsion of air coughing however is generally caused by an irritation or obstruction of the larynx or trachea and the air is expelled through the mouth while sneezing is caused by irritation of the nasal passages and the air is driven out through the nose laughing and crying also resemble one another in that each is an inspiration followed by a series of short spasmodic expirations during which the glottis is open and the vocal cords in characteristic vibration they differ however in rhythm and in the facial expression that accompanies them pg  chapter x the abdomen and the organs of digestion and excretion the abdominal cavity—below the diaphragm and separated from the lowest cavity of the trunk the pelvis only by an invisible plane drawn through the brim of the true pelvis is the abdominal cavity which may be said in a general way to contain the organs of digestion and the kidneys it is protected behind by the vertebræ and anteriorly by the lower ribs above and below by muscular walls which make possible the complete bending of the body these muscles are for the most part large and very strong and the greater number are inserted in part at least into a median tendinous line the linea alba which passes from the ensiform cartilage of the sternum above to the symphysis pubis below muscles—the external oblique muscles form the outermost layer of the abdominal wall they rise from the external surface of the eight lower ribs on either side and are inserted in the anterior half of the iliac crest as well as by aponeurosis in the linea alba where each joins its fellow from the opposite side the fibers running downward and inward like the fingers in the trouser’s pocket along the lower border of the aponeurosis is a broad fold poupart’s ligament the internal oblique rises on either side from the outer half of poupart’s ligament and the anterior part of the crest of the ilium and is inserted into the crest of the os pubis the cartilages of the lower ribs and the linea alba its fibers run at right angles to those of the external oblique these oblique muscles serve to compress the viscera to flex the body and also assist in expirationpg  the deepest of the abdominal muscles is the transversalis which rises from the outer third of poupart’s ligament and the adjoining part of the crest of the ilium from the six lower costal cartilages and by a broad aponeurosis the lumbar fascia from the lumbar vertebræ it is inserted into the pubic crest and by aponeurosis into the linea alba there is one of these muscles on either side  fig —muscles of the trunk from before left side superficial; and right side deep pectoralis major;

longus; gracilis dorland’s dictionary pg the rectus abdominis is also really two muscles and extends from the symphysis pubis to the cartilages of the fifth sixth and seventh ribs at first it passes back of the oblique and transversalis muscles but about a fourth of the way up it passes in front of the transversalis and between two layers of the internal oblique which thereafter forms its sheath its chief duty is to flex the chest on the pelvis though it also compresses the abdominal viscera one other muscle a small one is found in front the pyramidalis which rises from the pubic crest and is inserted into the linea alba midway to the umbilicus at the back the open space over the kidneys between the lower ribs and the os innominatum is closed in on either side by the quadratus lumborum which extends from the three or four lower lumbar vertebræ and the adjacent iliac crest to the last rib and the upper four lumbar vertebræ it flexes the trunk laterally or forward according as one muscle or both are used and may aid in either expiration or inspiration the nerves of the abdominal muscles are chiefly the internal intercostals the peritoneum—lining the abdominal cavity is a serous membrane the peritoneum which is reflected back over the viscera within in such a way as to cover each one wholly or in part folds of peritoneum the omenta connect the stomach with the other viscera the most important being the great omentum which has one layer descending from the anterior and another from the posterior wall of the stomach the mesenteries are double layers of peritoneum which hold the intestines to the vertebræ and posterior wall between their folds run the bloodvessels  fig —diagram showing the nine regions of the abdominal cavity right hypochondriac; epigastric; left hypochondriac; right lumbar; umbilical; left lumbar; right iliac; hypogastric; left iliac ashton abdominal regions—for convenience of description the abdominal cavity has been divided into nine regions by means of two transverse parallel lines the one through the ninth costal cartilages and the other just over the iliac crests and two perpendicular parallel lines pg through the cartilage of the eighth rib and the middle of poupart’s ligament on either side these nine regions have been named as follows the right and left hypochondriac regions up under the ribs with the epigastrium between the right and left lumbar regions next below with the umbilical between and the right and left inguinal with the hypogastric between others divide it into quadrants by one line drawn across and another down through the umbilicus the contents of the abdomen in full are the stomach intestines liver gallbladder spleen pancreas kidneys suprarenal capsules and the great vessels pg that is the organs of digestion and excretion when distended the bladder extends up into the abdominal cavity as does the uterus also when enlarged salivary digestion—although most of the digestive organs are situated in the abdomen the food enters the body through the mouth where its prehension is a voluntary act here digestion also begins and from the first the process is a double one mechanical and chemical mechanical digestion consisting largely of muscular movements by which the food is ground up and carried through the digestive tract thorough mastication or grinding of the food by the teeth is necessary while the tongue assists by moving the food about and by mixing it thoroughly with the saliva a viscid fluid composed of water and salts and having a slightly alkaline reaction the saliva is secreted by the parotid sublingual and submaxillary glands and serves to soften and dissolve the food and by virtue of its unorganized ferment ptyalin to convert starch into sugar upon proteins and fats it has practically no digestive action moderate warmth and an alkaline medium favor its action while extremes of heat or cold or an acid medium hinder it there is little absorption in the mouth though starch nicotine and alcohol may be absorbed in small quantities the pharynx—when the food is ready for deglutition or swallowing it is thrust back into the pharynx a somewhat conical musculomembranous sac situated base upward behind the nose and mouth and behind but somewhat above the larynx the pharynx is about four and a half inches long and ends on a level with the cricoid cartilage in the esophagus or gullet it is attached to the vertebræ at the back and opens in front into the mouth the posterior nares the eustachian tubes and the larynx also open into it the last being protected by the epiglottis which closes during deglutition to prevent food from entering the air passages just as the soft palate is drawn back to prevent regurgitation of food into the nose there are pg three coats to the pharynx a mucous coat continuous with that of the mouth and ciliated down to the floor of the nares; a fibrous coat and a muscular coat containing among others the constrictor muscles which serve to carry the food down to the esophagus its arteries are branches of the external carotid and its nerves come from the spinal accessory and the sympathetic occasionally a foreign body gets lodged in the pharynx just out of reach of the finger and threatens strangulation retropharyngeal abscess on the posterior wall occurs rarely  fig —position of the thoracic and abdominal organs front view morrow pg the esophagus—from the pharynx the food passes to the cardiac orifice of the stomach opposite the tenth dorsal vertebra through the esophagus a muscular tube about nine inches long which collapses when empty its lumen then appearing as a transverse slit it too has three coats an inner mucous coat; an areolar coat and a muscular coat the muscles being arranged in two sets an outer longitudinal layer and an inner circular layer by a series of rhythmic contractions especially of the circular fibers the food is pushed along though sometimes with liquid food there is no peristaltic action of the esophagus the pharyngeal muscles alone sending it to the stomach at the lower end of the esophagus an especially strong band of circular muscle fibers form a sort of sphincter which prevents the regurgitation of food the whole act of swallowing is a reflex not a voluntary act and is due to irritation set up by the stimulus of the foreign body the food stricture of the esophagus is common and may be of three kinds spasmodic occurring in nervous women; fibrous due to scar tissue or malignant due to cancer the stomach—the stomach is a pearshaped dilatation of the alimentary canal lying under the liver and diaphragm in the epigastrium and left hypochondrium and connecting the esophagus with the small intestine it lies largely behind the ribs but the greater curvature is only two fingers’ breadth above the umbilicus and can be manipulated through the skin the cardiac end into which the esophagus enters is the larger and points upward to the left the lesser and lower end known as the pylorus is at the right and its opening into the small intestine is guarded by the pyloric sphincter the lesser curvature is concave and on the upper surface; the greater convex and on the under surface the great omentum is attached to the latter in size the stomach varies more or less that of a man generally being larger than that of a woman but it is usually about ten inches pg long and four or five inches across it has a capacity of about five pints and serves as a storehouse for food the stomach has four coats a serous coat derived from the peritoneum; a muscular coat of three layers with longitudinal fibers continuous with those of the esophagus circular fibers and oblique fibers; an areolar coat and a mucous coat which when the stomach is empty is thrown into longitudinal folds or rugæ and whose surface is covered with glands the gastric glands for the secretion of the digestive fluids the arteries come from the celiac axis and the nerves from the pneumogastric and the solar plexus ulcer and cancer of the stomach are both rather common in the former there is apt to be hyperacidity and in the latter hypoacidity but the rule does not always hold in cases of ulcer there may be hemorrhage and even perforation such hemorrhage can be distinguished from hemorrhage from the lungs by its slightly acid odor and by the frothy character of hemorrhage from the lungs there is much irritation at the pylorus and where there is irritation there is liable to be cancer gastric digestion—in the stomach the food is churned and thoroughly mixed with the gastric juices and it is also subjected to a propulsive movement that drives it on to the intestine when it comes to the stomach it is semisolid and when it has become fluid or semifluid in which state it is known as chyme it is ready to pass on before it can do so however it must overcome the strong pyloric sphincter and this it does by the muscles about the sphincter pushing it constantly on until the sphincter gives way probably most of the propulsive movements take place within a few inches of the pylorus the gastric juice is secreted by glands in the wall of the stomach and poured out through little tubules which project from the surface it is a thin almost colorless fluid with a sour taste and odor due to the presence of free hydrochloric acid an important element in digestion probably when the stomach is empty and for some twenty pg minutes after the appearance of food there is no hydrochloric acid present and the food being alkaline salivary digestion continues then called forth by the presence of the food the hydrochloric acid appears and salivary digestion ceases in the acid medium little digestion of starches or fats takes place the chief action being on proteins which are converted into soluble peptones for besides hydrochloric acid the gastric juice contains two ferments pepsin which is particularly active in aiding the digestion of proteins and rennin which especially affects milk neither hydrochloric acid nor pepsin seems capable of digesting food alone but each is essential to the other they are secreted by different types of cells secretion depending upon the nerve supply and upon the presence of food gastric digestion is favored by minute subdivision of the food and by the right proportion of hydrochloric acid which should be per cent body temperature is also advantageous except that proteins are put in solution and partly digested little digestion goes on in the stomach and though the rugæ afford a large absorbing surface little absorption takes place although more takes place than in the mouth and in time most foods except fats can be absorbed the time of digestion varies with different foods and in different people but probably three to five hours are necessary the food leaves the stomach as chyme a fluid of about the consistency of pea soup vomiting is more or less the reverse of swallowing and is generally preceded by a feeling of nausea which starts up retching a more or less involuntary effort of the stomach to throw off its contents to relieve the retching a long breath is taken followed by a deep expiration that opens the cardiac end of the stomach and allows the abdominal muscles to force the food out after much vomiting and prolonged retching the pyloric end of the stomach may be affected and bile will then appear in the vomitus artificial vomiting may be pg produced by irritation of the gastric nerve center in the brain or by irritation of the stomach itself  fig —the intestinal canal stomach; duodenum; jejunum; ileum; cecum; vermiform appendix; ascending colon; transverse colon; descending colon; sigmoid flexure; rectum leidy intestinal canal—from the stomach the food passes into the intestinal canal a convoluted tube which extends from the stomach to the anus and in which more particularly in the upper portion the greater part of the digestion and absorption of food takes place this tube which is about six times the height of its possessor consists of two parts the small and the large intestines the first fourfifths or about feet being small intestine it occupies the central and lower parts of the abdominal cavity and a small portion of the pelvic cavity and is attached to the spine by the mesentery which however pg allows great freedom of motion so that there is little fixation to the loops of the small intestines the small intestine—the small intestine opens out of the stomach and has three divisions the duodenum which is only about ten to twelve inches long; the jejunum so called because it is generally empty after death which is about twofifths of the remainder and lies chiefly in the umbilical region and the left iliac fossa and the ileum or curved intestine the remaining threefifths which gets its name from its numerous coils and which lies in the middle and the right side of the abdomen there is no direct division between the jejunum and the ileum but the first part of the former and the last part of the latter are quite different in character at its entrance into the large intestine the ileum is guarded by the ileocecal valve  fig — central lacteal;   capillary network; columnar cells   the same coats continue in the small intestine as were found in the stomach but they are here much thinner and the inner coat is shaggy like velvet with innumerable minute processes called villi which greatly increase the absorbing surface in fact the great length of the intestine as well as the presence of the villi is aimed to provide a large surface to absorb the food as it passes an even greater increase of surface being provided by the fact that the intestinal wall is thrown into folds the valvulæ conniventes each villus is covered with a layer of columnar epithelial cells and has within connective tissue in which are found a fine capillary network and open lymph spaces from which leads a single lacteal vessel closely connected with the lymphatic vessels are the solitary glands small round bodies the size of a small pin’s head peyer’s glands or patches are patches of solitary glands opposite the mesenteric attachment and are largest and most numerous in the ileum in typhoid pg fever they are involved and may become the seat of ulcers there are also the glands of lieberkühn which secrete the succus entericus the arteries of the small intestine which include the superior mesenteric are from the celiac axis and the nerves are from the superior mesenteric plexus of the sympathetic the veins empty chiefly into the portal system the movements of the intestine like those of the esophagus are peristaltic but the action is complicated by the fact that the tube is not straight but in coils intestinal digestion—the food which enters the duodenum as chyme there comes in contact with the bile and the pancreatic juice which together but unmixed enter the duodenum from their respective ducts by a common orifice as in the stomach the digestive juices are called forth by the presence of food the bile is secreted in the liver from which it flows away through the hepatic duct which joins the cystic duct from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct through this it flows into the intestine during digestion but between whiles it passes up into the gallbladder where it is stored for future use and whence it is expelled when needed when pure it is a thick viscid liquid varying from a bright red to a greenishyellow in color according to the pigments present and of an alkaline reaction it consists chiefly of the bile pigments biliverdin which gives the green color and bilirubin which gives the red color and of bile salts in solution cholesterin which probably forms the basis of many gall stones is also present bile is a disinfectant to the bowel and a lubricant for the feces how much digestive action it has is a question but it affords the necessary alkaline medium for the pancreatic juice to act in the pancreatic juice is secreted by the pancreas from which it enters the intestine through the pancreatic duct and is probably the most important fluid in the digestive process it is clear practically colorless slightly viscid or gelatinous and quite strongly alkaline in reaction owing to the presence of sodium carbonate it contains pg three ferments amylopsin for the digestion of starch trypsin for the digestion of proteins and steapsin for the digestion of fats by it as by the saliva starch is turned into sugar or maltose in which form it is absorbed while proteins are converted into peptones as they are in the stomach since however fats are acted on nowhere else the chief function of the pancreatic juice may be considered to be the digestion of fats having broken through their albuminous envelope it divides them into glycerine and fatty acids and then emulsifies them with the assistance of the bile the food also comes in contact with the succus entericus a juice secreted by the glands of lieberkühn in the small intestine whose chief action is the conversion of sugar into glucose absorption—as the food is absorbed from the intestine it is liquid and entirely digested and is known as chyle practically all absorption takes place from the small intestine though there is a little in the large intestine it takes place in two ways through the portal vessels and through the lacteals which are the lymphatic vessels of the small intestine fats are absorbed practically entirely by the lacteals they enter the cells covering the villi travel thence to the lymph spaces and so into the lacteal or main lymph channel whence they are carried to the thoracic duct and the general circulation from the blood they are absorbed as fat and stored up as adipose or fatty tissue which is found throughout the body in connective tissue about the organs organic salts and water are for the most part absorbed by the portal system which they reach through the capillaries of the villi and through which they go to the liver starches in the form of sugar pass between the cells of the villi into the lymph spaces from which they are taken up by the capillaries on the way to the liver maltose becomes dextrose proteins in the form of peptones pass through the layer of epithelial cells to the lymph pg spaces and then to the capillaries an active part being taken by the cells by the time they reach the liver the peptones have been changed back into proteins in fact peptones seem to have some poisonous effect upon the blood if they get into it as such the large intestine—the large intestine differs from the small in size and in fixity of position lying curved in horseshoe shape above and around the small intestine it is five or six feet long large in caliber and is thrown into crosswise folds it has the same four coats as the small intestine but the mucous coat is pale and smooth without villi its glands are the crypts of lieberkühn and the solitary glands the arteries are branches of the superior and inferior mesenteric and the nerves come from sympathetic plexuses the blind sac lying in the right iliac fossa with which the large intestine begins is called the cecum and into this the ileum opens the ileocecal valve preventing regurgitation just below the ileocecal opening is the vermiform appendix a narrow wormlike tube with a blind end varying in length from one to nine inches but generally about four and onehalf inches long which so far as is known is functionless as well as dangerous people have been born without an appendix and it has in rare instances grown again after operation its base is located in the living by mcburney’s point a point two inches from the anterior superior spine of the ilium on a line drawn from the spine to the umbilicus from the cecum the intestine ascends in what is known as the ascending colon along the abdominal wall at the right to the under surface of the liver where it turns in the hepatic flexure abruptly across the body to the left passing below the liver stomach and spleen in the transverse colon in the splenic flexure it turns down the left abdominal wall the descending colon passing to the crest of the ilium where there is another curve the sigmoid flexure leading to the rectum which passes for six or eight inches down along the pg vertebræ a little to the left to the anus the external opening this opening is guarded by two sphincter muscles about an inch apart the internal and external sphincters the coils of the small intestine lie below the transverse colon covered mostly by the omentum the splenic flexure is behind the stomach and below the spleen and is slightly higher than the hepatic flexure the sigmoid flexure can be felt in the left inguinal region in thin people the fact that the rectum is somewhat to the left is of importance in childbirth because if the rectum is packed it may turn the child’s head in the wrong direction no digestion goes on in the large intestine the function being to dry by absorbing water the movements are practically the same as those of the small intestine except that they are much less active fermentation makes the contents acid by the time food reaches the rectum it has been thoroughly digested and has given up its nourishment it is then expelled as waste matter or feces defecation combines the involuntary movements of peristalsis and relaxation of the sphincters with the voluntary aid of the abdominal muscles the anospinal reflex by which movements of the bowel are regulated is in the lumbar enlargement of the cord the hemorrhoidal veins in the lower rectum are connected with both the systemic and the portal veins and have no valves so that as they are subjected to much strain they often become varicose and dilated this condition is called hemorrhoids or piles obstruction of the intestine may be caused by the growth of a constricting band by intussusception or telescoping of the intestine on itself especially at the ileocecal valve or by volvulus or twisting foreign bodies are sometimes found in the appendix but they are not usually the cause of appendicitis cancer of the intestine is common and its mass is apt to cause obstruction with all its attendant symptoms it may necessitate an artificial anus hernia or rupture may also occur and the hernia may become strangulatedpg  food and metabolism—anything serves as food that replaces or hinders the loss to which the component parts of the body are liable proteins carbohydrates fats some mineral matters as salt and perhaps iron and water are needed the energy once expended by plants or animals in the formation of the materials which serve as food is set free in the body by the breaking up of these complex substances into their original elements which are then recombined into the complex materials needed for the body’s life and growth this process of building up complex materials from simple ones is known as anabolism and that of breaking them down as katabolism while the two combined form the complete cycle of metabolism those foods have the best value that give up their energy most readily for their combustion heat oxygen and water are needed hunger indicates that the supply of material for katabolism has been used up and that more is needed just as thirst indicates the need of the system for more fluids the proteins or nitrogenous foods include all animal foods except fats fish crustaceans eggs milk and its products certain vegetables especially the lentils that is peas and beans and gelatine the fats include various fats and oils commonly eaten the carbohydrates are the starchy foods as cereals sugars fruits and most vegetables in fact practically all except the lentils various beverages and condiments have no great nutritive value but serve to stimulate the appetite and to excite the secretion of the digestive juices coffee tea and alcohol are stimulants the different classes of foods have different functions in the nourishment of the body the proteins are primarily tissuebuilders and also help somewhat in force production the fats are essentially heatproducers though they too help in force production the carbohydrates are chiefly important as forceproducers though they also produce heat and to a certain extent save protein oxidation fat pg is formed by all three but only in small amount by proteins so no one food can form the whole diet but there must be variety carbohydrates and fats are not sufficient for life some protein is necessary carbohydrates are more digestible than fats but have less potential energy gelatine saves waste of nitrogen though it does not increase the supply water and salts are not nutritive but they aid the body processes the water helping to dilute and dissolve substances for digestion the endproduct of the consumption of protein is urea which is eliminated by the kidneys just where it is formed is unknown but many think in the liver a trifling amount of urea is also eliminated in the sweat and in the breath as well as in the feces proteins increase nitrogenous metabolism and also the metabolism of other foods but the amount of nitrogen eliminated is just equal to that taken in probably some comes from the tissues themselves and not from the food the oxidation of carbohydrates and fats is measured by the amount of carbon excreted at first as much is given off as is taken in but after a while the carbohydrate is stored up as glycogen in the liver and the fats are stored as fat the amount of food needed varies with the person’s size and occupation less being needed for a child than for an adult and more for a hardworking man than for one who is doing less work in general to grams of protein to grams of fat to grams of carbohydrates grams of salts and grams of water is a fair amount foods are cooked to make them more digestible and to develop their flavor so that they will taste better cooking also kills germs and parasites that might be harmful meats should be cooked rapidly on the outside to coagulate the surface albumen and keep in the juices the heat besides coagulating the albumen turns the tough parts to gelatine in cereals the tough envelope of cellulose is broken up and in vegetables the tough fibrous parts are softened and made more digestiblepg  the liver—below the diaphragm on the right and extending across above the stomach resting in a way upon the transverse colon and the small intestine is the liver the largest gland in the body it is dark reddishbrown in color and is larger in proportion in the child than in the adult the upper surface is convex and lies in contact with the diaphragm while the lower surface is concave to fit over the organs beneath with a full breath it comes downward and forward with the edge against the abdominal wall and can be easily felt numerous strong ligaments including the suspensory ligament from the diaphragm hold it in place and it is more firmly fixed than any other of the abdominal organs probably on account of its large size it is divided by fissures into five lobes of which the most important are the right and left the right one being the largest and containing the gallbladder in one of its fissures  fig —the liver seen from below inferior vena cava; gallbladder morrow pg the liver tissue contains a large number of cells collected into lobules in the center of each of which is a bloodvessel the intralobular vein from which a network of capillaries extends to the edge of the lobule there being a capillary on either side of each row of cells between the cells also are the intercellular biliary passages roots of the bile ducts which exist in the connective tissue between the lobules and which join to form two main ducts one from the right and the other from the left lobe by the union of these two ducts the hepatic duct is formed which after a course of one or two inches joins the cystic duct from the gallbladder to form the ductus communis or common bile duct the liver has a double blood supply the hepatic artery from the celiac axis bringing nourishment to the connective tissue and the walls of the bloodvessels while the capillaries between the cells come from the portal vein which being formed by the junction of the superior and inferior mesenteric the splenic and the gastric veins contains the proteins and carbohydrates absorbed during digestion after its passage through the liver this blood from the portal vein is collected once more into the hepatic veins which convey it to the inferior vena cava during its passage however various changes take place for the liver plays an important part in the metabolic processes of the body the liver has two principal functions the secreting of bile and the storing up of glycogen the secretion of bile which is a very important aid to digestion is probably a reflex act the presence of peptones in the portal blood after meals acting as a stimulant to the liver cells for food at once increases the secretion of bile which is poured from the cells into the small bile ducts and finally passes into the hepatic duct and so to the gallbladder where it is stored until needed although the flow from the liver is constant the amount secreted reaches its maximum when the food gets down into the small intestine that is four or five hours after eating there being a lull pg before that apart from the process of secretion the manufacture of the bile pigments bilirubin and biliverdin which are made from the hemoglobin of the blood seems to require some special action on the part of the liver cells the glycogen which is manufactured and stored in the liver cells is a clear hyaline substance akin to starch and capable of being converted into sugar by the starch ferment probably there is some such ferment in the blood which converts the glycogen into sugar as soon as it passes from the liver into the blood though what it is is not known neither is it known just how glycogen is formed but it is manufactured chiefly after a mixed meal in which carbohydrates predominate proteins having little and fats no effect upon its formation it is undoubtedly formed from the sugar in the portal blood and the process requires some work on the part of the liver cell itself probably there is always some sugar in the circulating blood which as it is used up must be made good if there it not enough in the diet the liver supplies the deficiency from its store of glycogen glycogen is found also in the muscles in the placenta as food for the fetus in leucocytes and to a slight extent in cartilage in fact it is the form in which carbohydrate material is supplied to the tissues as needed normally much of the sugar is used up by the blood and its cells in metabolism giving rise to heat and energy in muscles glycogen is probably digested as lactic acid as before action muscle is neutral or slightly alkaline and after action acid when the liver is deranged and allows the glycogen to pass out into the blood too freely or when the glycogen is not held as such but turned to sugar and passed out in large quantities sugar in the urine or diabetes mellitus results besides its secreting function the liver has an eliminative function and plays an important part in purifying the blood removing from it many poisonous and narcotic substances it is thought by some though pg it has not been proved that urea the endproduct of protein metabolism which is brought by the blood to the kidneys and there excreted is formed in the liver at any rate urea is formed not only from the nitrogenous food eaten but from the metabolism of protein substances in the tissues being purely a waste product from which the nutritious substances have been absorbed the amount thrown off is an accurate gauge of the amount of protein metabolism going on the process of its manufacture is doubtless very complex ptosis or dropping of the liver sometimes occurs and is due to the stretching of the ligaments rupture is common generally as the result of a fall from a height on account of its size and friability the liver is also subject to many diseases cirrhosis occurs in people who drink a good deal and in its later stages is accompanied by ascites an accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity when there is a general accumulation of fluid throughout the body it is known as anasarca syphilis causes enlargement of the liver abscesses occur perhaps oftener in the tropics than farther north and may break into the lungs stomach or intestine the gallbladder—the gallbladder which is simply a reservoir for the bile is a pearshaped organ three inches long and one inch broad it lies in a fossa on the under side of the liver with the large end or fundus touching the abdominal wall just below the ninth costal cartilage here it can be felt as a small mass in empyema of the gallbladder normally it holds a little over one ounce but with occlusion it may become stretched its duct is the cystic duct which joins the hepatic duct in the common bile duct but bile only passes up into the gallbladder when the opening into the duodenum is closed that is between meals if one of the bile ducts is stopped up by a stone or cancer or for any other cause the bile backs up in the liver the pigments are absorbed pg into the circulation and jaundice results in this condition operation is dangerous as the time of coagulation of the blood normally five minutes or less is much delayed gall stones formed largely of bile pigments and cholesterin sometimes collect in the gallbladder where they cause irritation and may give rise to empyema of the gallbladder the stones vary in size from a pea to a hen’s egg and when small may be very numerous  fig —the pancreas spleen gallbladder etc showing their relations after sobotta the pancreas—another accessory organ of digestion is the pancreas the abdominal salivary gland as it is sometimes called on account of its close resemblance to the parotid gland this is a grayishwhite racemose gland six and a half inches long by one and a half inches wide and one inch thick lying behind the stomach on a level with the first and second lumbar vertebræ and shaped like a pistol with its handle toward the right in an emaciated person it can pg be felt the pancreatic duct runs the whole length of the gland from left to right and conveys the pancreatic juice from various little glands in the substance of the organ to the duodenum into which it empties along with the common bile duct by a common orifice the arteries are from the celiac axis and superior mesenteric the veins belong to the portal system and the nerves come from the solar plexus surgically the pancreas is of no special importance though acute pancreatitis does occasionally occur and is a very serious condition and one hard to diagnose the spleen—the largest and most important of the ductless glands is the spleen an oblong flattened organ lying deep in the left hypochondriac region between the stomach and diaphragm above the descending colon and corresponding to the ninth tenth and eleventh ribs it is soft brittle and very vascular its artery is a branch of the celiac axis and the vein belongs to the portal system its nerves are the pneumogastric and branches from the solar plexus the function is not well understood but probably it is connected with or related to the vascular system in some way perhaps it manufactures blood corpuscles the spleen varies more in size than any other organ normally it cannot be felt but in typhoid it usually can it is generally atrophied in old age and hypertrophied in almost all acute infectious diseases especially in typhoid fever and malaria in leukemia it is often greatly enlarged sometimes in violent falls it is ruptured and there is considerable hemorrhage the suprarenal capsules—the other ductless glands the suprarenal capsules yellowish triangular bodies are situated just above and in front of the kidneys their function is important but not well understood death accompanied by great muscular weakness follows the removal of both and when they are diseased similar weakness is observed and the skin becomes bronzed injection of the extract of the pg suprarenals stimulates the muscular system so probably they secrete into the blood minute quantities of a substance or substances beneficial to the body especially to the muscular system  fig —diagram of the relation of kidney to viscera spine and surface points american textbook of surgery the kidneys—the two kidneys lie on either side of the vertebræ at the back of the abdominal cavity and behind the peritoneum between the last dorsal and the third lumbar vertebræ their inner edge being about one inch from the spinous processes they are beanshaped four inches long two inches wide and one inch thick and are embedded in a mass of fat and loose areolar tissue they can be felt only when misplaced or when enlarged as by tuberculosis or malignant disease the whole kidney is enveloped in a fibrous capsule which normally may be peeled off but which in some diseases becomes adherent on the internal border is a fissure or hilum through which pass the bloodvessels and the ureter upon entering the ureter dilates into a sac the pelvis of the kidney into which project the malpighian pyramids of the medullary substance a substance made up of the pg straight uriniferous tubules and bloodvessels outside the medullary substance and just under the capsule is the cortex containing the malpighian bodies bloodvessels and the convoluted tubules or loops of henle each malpighian body contains within a capsule a plexus of capillaries the glomerulus with an afferent arteriole and an efferent vein the renal artery is a branch of the aorta and the nerves are from the solar plexus  fig

of uriniferous tubule; h uriniferous tubule the urine—as the blood passes through the glomeruli the urine is filtered off as it were probably by a process of transudation rather than simple filtration the cells lining the tubules also play an important part in its formation not by secreting new substances but by taking up those brought by the blood and discharging them into the convoluted tubules from which the urine passes through the straight tubules of the medulla to the pelvis to be carried thence by the pg ureter the process of the formation of the urine therefore is not purely a process of secretion but requires some action on the part of the kidney though no new substances are secreted in the kidney the passage of the urine down through the ureters is assisted by a kind of peristaltic action in the walls of the ureters and it is expelled from the body by the act of micturition which is mostly voluntary though a certain amount of nervous mechanism controls it the seat of this nervous mechanism is in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord in some nervous conditions especially where there is injury to the spinal cord there is involuntary micturition the urine is a watery solution containing many waste products especially urea it is generally amber in color varying in shade with circumstances with an aromatic characteristic odor when fresh it is acid in reaction and has a specific gravity of about though this too varies with circumstances besides water which is its chief constituent it contains urea uric acid organic acids urates inorganic salts including sodium chloride and phosphates of calcium and magnesium a certain amount of ammonia and certain pigments its acidity is due to acid sodium phosphate in solution but varies with the food and in disease the urine may become alkaline when passed after standing a few hours in a warm place it decomposes and becomes alkaline the quantity which is normally three pints or fifteen hundred cubic centimeters in twentyfour hours varies with the amount of fluid drunk the amount of perspiration etc the amount secreted depends chiefly however upon the flow of the blood through the kidneys; the greater the flow of blood the larger the amount of urine formed; and the blood flow is determined by blood pressure and by vasomotor action secretion also seems to be increased by the presence of urea which apparently serves as a stimulant to the kidney cellspg  the excretion of waste materials takes place by three main channels the lungs skin and kidneys and the materials are of four kinds urea carbon dioxide salts and water the lungs carry off carbon dioxide and water chiefly the skin these and inorganic salts while the kidneys eliminate practically all the urea as well as inorganic salts and water when the kidneys are not working the skin carries off much urea in fact a close relationship exists between the kidneys and the skin in the matter of excretion thus with increased perspiration in warm weather comes decreased urine while in cold weather the blood is sent in and the urine increased in amount to incite action of the kidneys drugs known as diuretics may be used these act in two ways by stimulating the kidney cells directly and by acting on the general circulation or nervous system any emotional or nervous excitement increases the flow of urine there are certain abnormal constituents of urine of which the two most important are albumen and sugar the former is found only when there is some disturbance of the kidneys ureters or bladder and its presence usually denotes some change in the cells lining the urinary tract it may occur in congestion of the kidney as well as in disease sugar is found only in diabetes the amount varying with the severity of the disease in jaundice certain bile pigments are present in the urine giving it a dark brown color and to the foam a greenishyellow color even normal urine has some sediment upon standing consisting of cells from the urinary tract and mucus in very acid urine after standing a heavy sediment whitish or pinkish ie brick dust in color is thrown down it does not necessarily denote disease but shows the urine is acid and concentrated in alkaline urine there is a sediment due to phosphates rupture of the kidney occurs but is not so serious as rupture of the pg liver or spleen because the kidney is situated outside of the peritoneum it necessitates the removal of the kidney however and when for any reason one kidney is removed the other increases in size and does double work to compensate for the loss removal of both kidneys means death sometimes the kidney becomes loose and moves about a condition known as floating kidney perinephritic abscess is abscess in the loose fatty tissue about the kidney  fig —the urinary organs viewed from behind the ureters one for each kidney are tubes the size of a goose quill and about fourteen inches long extending from the hilum of the kidney to the base of the bladder they have three coats an internal mucous a muscular and an external fibrous coat this last being continuous with the cortex of the kidney and the fibrous tissue of the bladder in the female the ureters may be felt through the wall of the vagina as they come into the bladder in tubercular disease of one kidney the ureter becomes inflamed and enlarged and through the vagina feels almost like a lead pencil a sure diagnostic sign the bladder and urethra—in their course to the bladder pg the ureters pass from the abdominal into the pelvic cavity but before describing the pelvis itself it will be well to complete the account of the urinary organs by considering the bladder and urethra the bladder is the reservoir for the urine and has muscular walls lined with mucous membrane a peritoneal coat covers the upper surface and is reflected to the walls of the abdomen and pelvis it is situated back of the os pubis the front bone of the pelvis with its base or fundus directed downward and backward normally it is in the pelvis but when much distended it mounds up into the abdominal cavity where it can be felt in front as a tumor it rests on the rectum in the male and on the cervix in the female and is held in place by numerous ligaments when empty it may be yshaped but it becomes oval when distended its capacity is about one pint the lower abdominal wall and the anterior wall of the bladder may be wanting congenitally in paralysis of the sphincter at the neck of the bladder distention results stones may be found in the bladder from the neck of the bladder the urine passes out of the body through the urethra this in the male passes down through the penis and is about ten inches long except when urine is passing it is a transverse slit with the upper and under surfaces in contact while at the end of the penis the slit of the meatus urinarius is vertical when the penis is flaccid the urethra describes a sharp curve before its entrance into the bladder but it becomes approximately straight when the penis is raised at right angles to the body—an important point to remember in catheterization in the female the urethra is straight and much shorter being only about one and a half inches long the meatus urinarius is in the anterior vaginal wall about one inch behind the clitoris sometimes the urethra is ruptured in a fall stricture of the urethra occurs sometimes after gonorrhoea owing to the formation of scar tissue following ulcer pg  chapter xi the pelvis and the genital organs the pelvis—before taking up the pelvic organs the pelvis itself should be described the name pelvis has been given to the bony ring which is interposed between the spine and the femurs on account of its resemblance to a basin at the back of this basin or pelvis are the sacrum and coccyx already described in connection with the back and at the sides and meeting in the median line in front are the two ossa innominata or nameless bones so called on account of their peculiar and indescribable shape at birth each os innominatum is made up of three bones the ilium ischium and pubes but about pg the age of puberty the three become welded into one at their point of junction is the cavity of the acetabulum for articulation with the head of the femur or thigh bone  fig —front view of the pelvis with its ligaments dorland a anterior sacroiliac ligament; b iliofemoral ligament; c obturator membrane; d symphysis pubis; e sacrosciatic ligament  fig —the right innominate bone after toldt the upper expanded portion of the os innominatum is the ilium whose upper border is known as the crest and which has two spinous processes front and back a superior and an inferior the superior spine being in each case the larger these spines especially the anterior superior spines and the crest give attachment to many muscles and to the outer surface of the bone the gluteal muscles are attached the anterior superior spine is also important in making measurements to ascertain whether both legs are of equal lengthpg  below the ilium posteriorly is the body of the ischium which has on its lower edge a tuberosity the prominent bone on which one sits near the upper edge is the spine of the ischium between which and the posterior inferior spine of the ilium is the greater sacrosciatic notch for the passage of vessels and nerves including the sciatic nerves from the tuberosity the ramus extends forward below the obturator foramen a large opening between the ischium and the pubes also for the passage of vessels and nerves to meet the pubes the last and smallest of the three bones which go to make up the os innominatum the anterior surface of each pubes presents a crest ending externally in a spine and the two pubic bones join in front in the symphysis pubis the bone gets its name from the growth of pubic hairs over this region at puberty  fig —diameters of the pelvis d anteroposterior; o b oblique; t r transverse de nancrede anteriorly the ossa innominata support the external organs of generation while within are the internal organs of generation on the inner surface of the ilium slightly above the level of the acetabulum is the ileopectineal line above which lie the iliac fossæ a plane drawn through the prominence of the sacrum the ileopectineal lines and the upper margin of the symphysis pubis serves to divide the upper or false pelvis from the lower or true pelvis the false pg pelvis which is the larger serves to support the intestines and to take part of the weight from the abdominal walls while the true pelvis being more surrounded by bone and so capable of affording more protection guards the internal organs of generation the lower circumference of the pelvis is known as the outlet in the female the bones are lighter the sacrum less curved and the diameters greater than in the male on the whole the pelvic bones are well covered in with muscles the anterior superior spine however is easily felt in front and the whole crest can be felt back to the posterior superior spine the tuberosity of the ischium also can be felt especially when the thigh is flexed for it is largely uncovered of muscles the spine of the os pubis can always be felt on a level with the great trochanter and the relation of its position to that of a hernia shows whether the rupture is above or below poupart’s ligament that is whether it is inguinal or femoral occasionally there is lack of development of the pubic bones for two or three inches and the bladder is exposed fracture of the pelvis may occur perhaps with injury to the viscera the acetabulum may be fractured or the sacrum broken with injury to the sacral plexus of nerves causing paralysis of the lower extremities and of the sphincters with resultant involuntary passage of urine and feces and in childbirth the coccyx is often broken in rickets there may be great deformity of the pelvis causing trouble in childbirth later in life osteomalacia is a disease of adults in which the bones are soft and the weight pushes the promontory of the sacrum forward and approximates the sides of the pelvis the male generative organs—the male generative organs consist of the prostate gland testes and penis the prostate gland is shaped like a small horsechestnut and is composed of numerous glands from which come a dozen or more excretory ducts it surrounds the neck of the bladder and the beginning of the pg urethra and is next to the rectum through which an examination may be made to determine its size for it often enlarges in elderly men the frequent passage of urine in small amounts being a symptom of enlarged prostate the procreating glands which secrete the spermatozoa or semen are two in number the testes or testicles and are homologous to the ovaries in the female they are ovoid in form and are suspended by the spermatic cords in a sac the scrotum back of the penis during early fetal life they are in the back of the abdomen near the kidneys but before birth they descend along the inguinal canals into the scrotum the excretory duct of the testis is called the vas deferens it passes up by the spermatic cord through the inguinal canal into the pelvis to the base of the bladder and at the base of the prostate joins the duct of the vesicula seminalis to form the ejaculatory duct the two vesiculæ seminales are small receptacles for the semen lying in contact with the base of the bladder and secrete a fluid with which they dilute the semen the ejaculatory duct terminates near the prostate in the urethra by a slitlike orifice on each side the spermatozoa being finally excreted through the urethra the penis is the external organ of generation in the male and is attached to the pubes and the anterior part of the ischium it is composed of erectile tissue and encloses the urethra the meatus urinarius appearing at its end as a vertical slit toward the end the skin of the penis is loose and is prolonged forward in what is known as the prepuce or foreskin it is this that is clipped away in circumcision the female generative organs—the female generative organs include the ovaries fallopian tubes uterus vagina and the external genitalia or vulva the ovaries which are homologous to the testes in the male are two flattened oval bodies grayish pink in color suspended from the pg lateral or broad ligaments which fasten the uterus to the walls of the pelvis they are one and a quarter inches long threequarters of an inch wide and half an inch thick and are attached at the upper end to one of the fimbriæ of the fallopian tubes they consist of numerous graafian follicles embedded in a fibrous stroma each follicle containing an ovum about ¹₁₂₅ inch in diameter and just visible to the naked eye when a follicle ruptures and discharges an ovum an irregular yellow spot the corpus luteum appears at the point of rupture after ordinary menstruation it is known as the false corpus luteum and after conception as the true

dickinson the uterus is a pearshaped organ about three inches long two inches broad above and one inch thick situated in the pelvic cavity between the rectum and the bladder the wide part or fundus is above pg and the narrow neck or cervix below lying partly within the vagina the whole is held in place by ligaments these include the broad ligaments which extend from the sides of the uterus to the lateral walls of the pelvis and the round ligaments two muscular cords about four inches long which pass out through the abdominal ring into the inguinal canal and so to the mons veneris and labia thus corresponding to the spermatic cords in the male the cavity of the body of the uterus is small and flattened and opens into the cervix by the internal os uteri the external os being at the opening of the cervix into the vagina there are three coats a serous coat derived from the peritoneum a muscular coat of unstriped fibers which forms the bulk of the whole organ and a mucous coat covered with ciliated epithelium the uterus is always enlarged during menstruation and is enormously enlarged in pregnancy it receives the fecundated ovum retains and supports it during the development of the fetus and is the chief agent of expulsion in tubal or extrauterine pregnancy the ovum becomes attached in the tube instead of in the uterus and develops there rupturing the tube and causing serious hemorrhage the passage from the cervix out of the body is the vagina a membranous canal curved upward and backward to conform to the axis of the pelvis and attached above to the cervix ordinarily the sides are in contact the arteries of the internal organs of generation are the uterine from the internal iliac and the ovarian from the aorta in the female the pudic branches of the internal iliac and the spermatic from the aorta in the male the nerves are largely from the sympathetic system abscess formation occurs frequently in the tubes and gonorrheal infection may spread up the vagina and through the uterus to the tubes and even to the abdominal cavity itself the tubes may also be tubercularpg  salpingectomy or removal of the tubes is the commonest operation after that

structure made up of many small muscles its surface is known as the perineum it is frequently torn wholly or in part during childbirth and has to be sewed up pg  chapter xii the upper extremities the upper extremities include the shoulders arms forearms wrists and hands and contain each thirtytwo bones the bones of the two shoulders taken together are called the shoulder girdle and consist of the two clavicles or collar bones and the two scapulæ or shoulder blades which together make an almost complete girdle of the shoulders the clavicle is a long slender bone extending almost horizontally from the sternum to the scapula and can be felt for its whole length in the living for the inner twothirds it is convex anteriorly for the outer third concave in woman it is generally less curved smoother and more slender than in man and as bone is rough when the muscles attached are powerful the right clavicle being used more is generally rougher and thicker than the left among the muscles attached are the large neck muscle the sternocleidomastoid whose tendons form the presternal notch the trapezius the pectoralis major and the deltoid being slender and superficial the clavicle is most frequently broken of any bone in the body generally by indirect violence as by falling with the hand out though old people in such a case are apt to get colles’ fracture at the wrist the bone generally gives way at the juncture of the outer and middle thirds with displacement of the parts inward so that the fracture is seldom compound since however the main vessels of the upper arm with their nerves lie beneath the clavicle there is danger of their being punctured such serious injury is guarded against by the presence of the subclavius muscle the clavicle is occasionally removed for sarcomapg  fig —bones of the upper extremity toldt pg  fig —left scapula posterior surface after toldt the scapula or shoulder blade so called from its shape is a large flat triangular bone with a

dorsal vertebræ the head in which is situated the glenoid cavity for articulation with the humerus or upper arm bone is surrounded by a slight constriction the neck above it projects the coracoid process so called from its fancied resemblance to a crow’s beak this can usually be felt about one inch from the juncture of the outer and middle thirds of the clavicle and from it arise the short head of the biceps and the coracobrachialis muscle the acromion process at the end of the spine extends out beyond the glenoid cavity posteriorly and affords pg attachment to the deltoid and trapezius muscles it forms the summit of the shoulder numerous other muscles are attached to the surface of the scapula the only parts which are truly subcutaneous being the whole length of the spine and the acromion process though the lower angle and the coracoid process can generally be felt the muscles bulge so much that the spine in the living appears as a slight depression extending back almost to the vertebræ the large number of the muscles on the shoulder and arm is due to the great flexibility and strength required for the various uses to which the arms are put shoulder muscles—the most important shoulder muscle is the deltoid a large triangular muscle which surrounds and protects the shoulderjoint and gives the shoulder its rounded form it rises from the outer third of the clavicle from the acromion process and from the whole length of the spine of the scapula and is inserted by a tendon into a rough prominence on the middle of the outer side of the humerus it serves to raise the arm and to draw it somewhat forward or back according as the anterior or posterior fibers are used the pectoralis major rises from the inner half of the clavicle the front of the sternum and the cartilages of the true ribs and its fibers converge to form a fanshaped muscle which is inserted by a flat tendon into the edge of the bicipital groove on the humerus it draws the arm forward and inward and helps considerably in forced inspiration the serratus magnus rises from the outer surface and upper border of the eight upper ribs and from an aponeurosis covering the upper intercostal spaces and is inserted along the whole length of the posterior border of the scapula it carries the scapula forward and is used in pushing the scapula is seldom broken because it is quite movable and is covered with large muscles and because it lies on the chest which serves as an elastic cushion the acromion process is the part most pg frequently broken and occasionally the neck is fractured tumors occur and may necessitate the amputation of the whole upper extremity the humerus—the bone of the upper arm the humerus is the largest bone in the upper extremity and articulates with the scapula above and with the ulna and radius below at its upper end are the head and the anatomical neck with the greater tuberosity external to and the lesser tuberosity in front of them the constriction of the surgical neck is below the tuberosities and extending from between them downward and inward along the upper third of the bone is the bicipital groove for the long head of the biceps though round above below the shaft becomes flattened from before backward and curves slightly forward terminating in the internal and external condyles from the former of which the flexors and the round pronator arise and from the latter the extensors and supinators from the external condyle also there projects in front the radial head or capitellum for articulation with the radius internally to the capitellum in front and in a corresponding position on the back of the bone are the trochlear surfaces for articulation with the ulna there being a depression in front called the coronoid fossa for the reception of the coronoid process of the ulna in flexion of the forearm and another depression behind the olecranon fossa to receive the tip of the olecranon process during extension on the lower half of the humerus at the back is the spiral groove for the musculospiral nerve and the superior profunda artery while the ulnar nerve runs in a groove back of the internal condyle the humerus is almost completely covered with muscles the only part that is subcutaneous being a small portion of the external and internal condyles the head can be felt under the muscles and

tendon arching over the head of the humerus and descending in the bicipital groove it is inserted into the back of the tuberosity of the radius and by a broad aponeurosis into the fascia of the forearm it flexes and supinates the forearm and renders the fascia pg tense its inner border forms a guide in tying the brachial artery as this artery runs along its inner side the brachialis anticus rises from the lower half of the outer and inner surfaces of the humerus and is inserted into the coronoid process of the ulna thus covering and projecting the elbowjoint anteriorly it is a flexor of the forearm another smaller muscle on the anterior arm which also aids in flexion is the coracobrachialis which extends from the coracoid process of the scapula to the middle of the inner surface of the humerus extending the entire length of the posterior surface of the humerus is the triceps similar to the quadriceps extensor in the thigh and direct antagonist to the biceps and brachialis anticus muscles it rises by a long head from below the glenoid fossa by the external head from the upper third of the posterior surface of the humerus and by the internal head from the middle and lower thirds of the posterior surface it is inserted in the olecranon process of the ulna and serves to extend the forearm and arm the humerus is more often fractured by muscular action than any other bone usually the fracture occurs in the lower half of the bone and sometimes the musculospiral nerve is involved there is a great tendency to nonunion probably due to interposition of soft parts sometimes the break is across and down between the condyles tfracture involvement of the elbowjoint is more serious than fracture of the humerus alone sarcoma of the humerus does occur and may require the removal of the clavicle and scapula as well as of the arm bone itself in amputation of the humerus in children a long skin flap is left to allow for growth of the bone as it is liable to grow again the ulna—in the forearm there are two bones the ulna and the radius of which the former is the longer the ulna is on the inner side of the forearm and its upper end forms the greater part of the pg articulation with the humerus as most of the articulation at the wrist is formed by the radius and the interarticular fibrocartilage the head of the ulna is at the lower extremity of the bone and articulates on the outer side with the radius and below with the triangular fibrocartilage from its inner side projects the styloid process the olecranon process forms the upper extremity and presents anteriorly an articular surface the greater sigmoid cavity for articulation with the trochlea of the humerus where it fits into the olecranon fossa during extension the same articulating surface also covers the coronoid process a smaller projection below and in front of the olecranon which fits into the coronoid fossa during flexion continuous with the greater sigmoid cavity on the outer side is the lesser sigmoid cavity for articulation with the head of the radius under the triceps tendon which is inserted into the olecranon is a bursa or sac of synovial membrane such as occurs in parts where much force is brought to bear the radius—the radius or spoke of the wheel is on the outer side of the forearm and gets its name from the way it turns upon the ulna in pronation the shaft is larger below than above and is slightly curved longitudinally for greater strength the upper extremity or head is small and has a slightly concave upper surface for articulation with the radial head of the humerus it articulates by its sides with the lesser sigmoid cavity and is bound to the ulna by the orbicular ligament which runs over a smooth articular surface below the head is the constriction of the neck with the tuberosity for the biceps tendon to the inner side below the lower extremity is large and forms the chief part of the wristjoint articulating with the semilunar and scaphoid bones of the wrist from the lower extremity the strong conical styloid process projects externallypg  fig —bones of the right forearm in a position of supination toldt in the living the olecranon process of the ulna is always felt at the elbow and the posterior border of the ulna forms the prominent ridge down the forearm leading to the styloid process the head of the radius is felt just below the external condyle and often makes a dimple in the muscles of the forearm the rest of its upper half is concealed with muscles but the lower half is easily felt as there are only tendons over it the styloid process is felt externally normally that pg of the radius is a little lower than that of the ulna so that in cases of fracture their relative position is of considerable importance as showing the amount of deformity the two forearm bones are more frequently broken together than separately and generally by direct violence the lower fragment being usually drawn up by the action of the flexor and extensor muscles and producing a swelling on the palmar surface of the forearm indirect violence usually causes fracture of the radius only in both cases but especially in fracture of both bones there is a tendency for membrane to get between the fragments so the arm is put up in splints with the hand midway between pronation and supination in order to separate the bones as far as possible care must be taken not to have the bandage too tight or gangrene of the fingers may result in most fractures of the arm it is put up bent but in fracture of the olecranon it is put up fully extended as the fragment is sure otherwise to be displaced by the pull of the triceps in fact the olecranon is sometimes fractured by the muscular force of the triceps though usually its fracture which is frequent is due to direct violence the ulna is also often fractured in the middle by direct violence or the styloid process may be broken fracture of the neck or shaft of the radius is very common the most important arm fracture being that of the lower end of the radius or colles’ fracture this and the corresponding fracture in the leg pott’s fracture are two of the commonest fractures in dislocation of the wrist the normal relation of the two styloid processes remains unchanged but in colles’ fracture the lower fragment often projects on the back of the hand making a typical deformity called the silver fork deformity the bones of the wrist and hand had best be described before the forearm muscles are taken up as the muscles of the forearm are distributed largely to the fingers the wrist—the wrist or carpus is made up of pg eight bones arranged in two rows of four each in the first row are the scaphoid and semilunar bones on the outer side articulating with the radius the cuneiform articulating with the fibrocartilage of the wristjoint and the pisiform in the second row in corresponding positions are the trapezium trapezoid os magnum and unciform the eminence felt on the radial side of the wrist is the protuberance of the scaphoid while the pisiform is generally felt on the ulnar side  fig —right carpal bones dorsal surface t trapezium; t´ trapezoid; os magnum; u unciform; s scaphoid; l semilunar; c cuneiform; p pisiform the hand—the hand contains nineteen bones five metacarpal bones one for each finger and the thumb whose bases articulate with the lower row of wrist bones and fourteen phalanges three for each finger and two for the thumb of which the first row articulate with the metacarpal bones they are all long bones and are slightly concave anteriorly when the hand is flexed it is the heads of the metacarpal bones not the bases of the phalanges that are so prominent the head of the third metacarpal being most prominent the metacarpals are seldom fractured though bad fractures occasionally occur in comminuted fracture nothing can be done but remove the bone if the periosteum is left the bone will grow again pg two diseases sometimes affect the metacarpals and the phalanges tuberculosis and syphilis both cause swelling of the bones muscles of the forearm—the chief groups of muscles on the forearm are the flexors and pronators on the anterior surface and the extensors and supinators on the posterior surface in general the flexors and pronators take their origin from on or around the internal condyle while the extensors and supinators arise on or around the external condyle where not otherwise stated it will be understood that such is their origin in a general way they may by grouped as follows

radialis is inserted into the base of the index and usually of the third metacarpal bone the flexor carpi ulnaris into the fifth metacarpal the pisiform and the unciform bones while the palmaris longus goes to the anterior annular ligament of the wrist and the palmar fascia of the hand the flexor sublimis digitorum is inserted by four tendons into the second phalanges of the fingers while the flexor profundus digitorum arises from the upper part of the ulna and is inserted into the last phalanges of the fingers the flexor of the thumb arises from the middle of the radius and is inserted into the last phalanx of the thumb which joint is flexed by a muscle depends upon the origin and insertion of the muscle all those included between being affected thus the flexor sublimis digitorum which has its origin in part at least from the condyle and is inserted in the second phalanges of the fingers flexes the forearm wrist and all the fingerjoints but the last while the flexor profundus digitorum arising from the ulna though it flexes the wrist and fingers has no power of flexing the forearm the pronator radii teres besides arising from the supracondylar ridge rises from the coronoid process of the ulna it is inserted into the middle of the outer surface of the radius and serves to pronate the forearm the other pronator the pronator quadratus is a small quadrilateral muscle extending transversely across the radius and ulna just above their carpal extremities it rises from the anterior surface of the ulna and is inserted into the anterior external border of the radius on the back of the forearm the anconeus serves to extend the forearm only being inserted into the upper part of the posterior surface of the ulna the extensors of the wrist are inserted into the bases of the various metacarpal bones and have some power to extend the forearm as well as the wrist the extensors of the thumb as their names imply go one to the metacarpal bone and one to each of the phalanges pg the longest one extending the whole thumb the others only a part they rise from the ulna and radius not the condyle the extensor communis digitorum goes to all the phalanges of all the fingers the extensor minimi digiti to those of the little finger only and the extensor indicis to those of the index finger the last two arising short of the condyle of the supinators the longer one is inserted into the styloid process of the radius while the shorter one the supinator brevis is inserted into the upper part of the same bone both thus serving to turn the radius on the ulna where the tendons of the various muscles pass over the wrist both front and back they are covered with a synovial sheath and are held down by a broad ligament which some of them perforate the annular ligament the strong fibrous band of the anterior annular ligament arches over the carpal bones in front beneath it pass the median nerve and the tendons of the flexors of the fingers and thumb the posterior annular ligament is of less importance the deep palmar fascia forms a sheath for the muscles of the hand in carpenters there sometimes occurs dupuytren’s contraction of the palmar fascia which draws the fingers up as operation is not always successful it is quite a serious matter the muscles of the hand itself include various abductor adductor and short flexor muscles of the thumb and little finger there also extend between the metacarpal bones the lumbricales four small muscles that aid the deep flexor muscles; likewise seven interossei of which four are dorsal and three palmar the dorsal interossei arise by two heads from the adjacent sides of the metacarpal bones and are inserted into the bases of the first phalanges thus abducting the fingers; while the palmar interossei arising from the palmar surface of the second fourth and fifth metacarpals are inserted into the pg three corresponding first phalanges and adduct the fingers toward an imaginary line drawn through the middle finger joints of the upper extremity—the joints of the upper extremity with the exception of the wristjoint are the most freely movable of any in the body probably because the hand has the finest work to do and a greater number of motions are required even the wrist has much greater freedom of motion than the corresponding joint in the lower extremity the shoulderjoint is rather a deep joint to allow of the varied motion required and has a capsular ligament from the margin of the glenoid fossa above to the neck of the humerus below the elbow which is a hinge joint has an anterior and a posterior ligament and two lateral ligaments as is practically the case in all such joints the wrist has several ligaments which taken together are capsular in nature blood supply of the upper extremity—the blood supply of the upper extremity comes through the subclavian artery which on the right springs from the innominate artery and on the left from the aortic arch it remains one trunk as far as the elbow though different names have been given to different parts thus as it passes over the lower border of the first rib it becomes the axillary and at the lower border of the axilla where it starts down the arm the brachial at the elbow it divides into the ulnar and radial arteries in its upper part the brachial artery lies internal to the humerus but below it is in front of the bone the radial runs in a line from the middle of the elbow anteriorly to the inner side of the styloid process of the radius and is much exposed to injury in the lower third of its course as when the hand is thrust through glass on it at the wrist the pulse is counted it is much smaller than the ulnar and winds around the outer side of the thumb to the palm where with the deep branch from the ulnar it forms the deep palmar arch the pg ulnar artery passes obliquely inward to the middle of the forearm and thence along its ulnar border to the palm of the hand where it divides into the deep branch and the superficial palmar arch which supplies the four digital arteries from the axillary artery branches go to the chest wall and shoulder the most important being the two circumflex arteries to the deltoid the brachial has only two branches of any importance the superior and inferior profunda both on the upper arm of course in case of hemorrhage compression can frequently be applied with the fingers where the subclavian crosses the rib or in the axilla where the artery can be pressed up against the humerus nerves—the nerve supply of the shoulder comes chiefly from the anterior and posterior thoracic the suprascapular and the circumflex these last going to the deltoid the biceps is supplied by the musculocutaneous the triceps by the musculospiral and the brachialis anticus by both most of the flexor and pronator muscles are supplied by the median while the posterior interosseous and the musculospiral nerves go to the extensors and supinators the ulnar nerve supplies the hand largely pg  chapter xiii the lower extremities the lower extremities resemble the upper very closely in the arrangement of the bones muscles arteries and nerves though modifications occur due to the difference in function of the lower limbs there is one long bone in the upper part or thigh the femur and two in the lower part or leg the tibia and fibula while over the kneejoint is the patella or kneecap the ankle has seven bones and the foot nineteen like the hand the femur—the femur is the longest bone in the body being about onefourth the height of the person it inclines toward its fellow at the knee in order to bring the kneejoints near the center of gravity in walking the amount of inclination varying with the width of the hips and the height of the person on account of the greater width of hip the tendency to knockknee is greater in women than in men the shaft of the femur is enlarged at the extremities and is slightly curved forward the concavity being strengthened at the back by a longitudinal ridge the linea aspera along part of which the gluteus maximus muscle is attached the head which is covered with cartilage except for an oval depression for the attachment of the ligamentum teres one of the ligaments of the hipjoint and which articulates with the hollow of the acetabulum in the os innominatum projects considerably upward inward and forward from the shaft the neck varying much in length and angle it is generally more pg horizontal in women than in men and in rickets the great weight on the softened bone tends to press the head down causing the deformity known as “coxa vera” in which the neck is almost horizontal extending upward outward and backward from the shaft at the base of the neck about threequarters of an inch lower than the head and about on a pg level with the acetabulum and the spine of the os pubis is the greater trochanter this large irregular prominence and the smaller one of the lesser trochanter which is at the lower part of the base of the neck posteriorly are for the attachment of muscles and to assist in rotating the bone the lower extremity of the femur is larger than the upper and is flat from before backward between its two large eminences the external and internal condyles is a smooth depression in front the trochlear surface for articulation with the patella the external condyle is more prominent in front the internal inferiorly the latter being the longer of the two by about half an inch the epiphysis at the lower end of the femur is the only one in which ossification has begun at birth therefore if ossification is found there the child is known to have arrived at full term  fig —bones of the lower extremity toldt so many large muscles are attached to the femur that the shaft cannot be detected in the living unless the person is very thin and poorly developed the outer surface of the greater trochanter however and the condyles can be felt a string stretched from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the tuberosity of the ischium passes in the middle just over the upper edge of the greater trochanter the line thus drawn is known as nélaton’s line and is of considerable importance in many conditions of the hip thus if the hip is dislocated the trochanter will be thrown above nélaton’s line and in osteomalacia the pelvis sinks and the trochanter is again above the line thigh muscles—of the thigh muscles only a few need be mentioned one large muscle is the psoas magnus which has its origin on the front of the last dorsal and all the lumbar vertebræ passes pg down across the brim of the pelvis and under poupart’s ligament gradually diminishing in size and terminates in a tendon that is inserted into the lesser trochanter it serves to flex the thigh on the pelvis and to rotate it outward the psoas parvus rises from the last dorsal and the first lumbar vertebræ and does not go out of the pelvis the sartorius or tailor muscle is flat and ribbonlike and is the longest muscle in the body it rises from the anterior superior spine of the ilium and is inserted into the upper inner surface of the shaft of the tibia by it the legs are crossed it also forms the outer side of an important landmark scarpa’s triangle whose base is formed by poupart’s ligament and the inner side by the adductor magnus muscle which passes from the ramus of the os pubis and the tuberosity of the ischium to the linea aspera the femoral artery bisects the triangle and runs into its apex the bulk of the anterior portion of the thigh is formed by the quadriceps extensor which is really made up of four muscles the rectus femoris whose origin is on the anterior inferior iliac spine and above the acetabulum; the vastus externus which comes from the greater trochanter and the upper linea aspera; and the vastus internus and crureus which rise from the neck of the femur and the linea aspera it is inserted into the tubercle of the tibia by the ligamentum patellæ in which the patella lies its action is to extend the leg at the back and forming the buttocks are the three glutei muscles the gluteus maximus medius and minimus all these rise from the outer side of the ilium and have their insertion on or about the great trochanter they serve to hold the trunk erect and to extend abduct and rotate the thighpg  fig   fig fig  fig

the thigh and its tendon which embraces the external lateral ligament of the kneejoint forms the outer hamstring on the inner side are the semitendinosus and the semimembranosus muscles these rise from the tuberosity of the ischium and are inserted the one into the upper inner surface of the shaft of the tibia and the other into the internal tuberosity of the tibia their tendons form the inner hamstring like pg the biceps they serve to extend the thigh and flex the leg on the thigh but where the biceps rotates the leg out they being attached to the inner side of the leg bones rotate it in the patella or small pan is a flat somewhat triangular bone developed in the quadriceps extensor tendon four muscles are attached to it as well as the ligamentum patellæ which holds it to the tibia and gives increased leverage by making the quadriceps extensor work at a greater angle it articulates with the condyles and serves to protect the joint one bursa the prepatella bursa separates it from the skin and another surrounded by adipose tissue from the head of the tibia the external surface can be seen and felt on the front of the knee and the bone can be moved from side to side when the leg is straight joints of the lower extremity—the hipjoint is a ballandsocket joint but is not so freely movable as the shoulderjoint the head of the femur being held in the acetabulum by many strong ligaments of which the most important is the capsular ligament the kneejoint is largely a hinge joint but in some positions it has some rotation it is formed by the condyles of the femur the head of the tibia and the patella and has fourteen ligaments including the ligamentum patellæ and the crucial ligaments its synovial sac is the largest found in any joint two semilunar cartilages placed on the head of the tibia serve to deepen the socket for the condyles changing somewhat in shape and thickness as the joint moves the interval between the thigh and the leg bones can be felt at the knee when the leg is extended the juncture of the bones is slightly above the patella while in flexion a knife passed below the apex of the patella will pass into the joint congenital dislocation of the hip occurs separation of the epiphysis of the femur may occur and sometimes the neck rarely the lower part of the shaft is fractured either condyle may be fractured off or there may be a tfracture in which case the popliteal pg artery may be injured in dislocation the head may be behind or in front of the acetabulum impacted hip where the neck of the femur has in a fall been driven into the head is common in old people sometimes especially in young children the bone is infected osteomyelitis sarcoma occurs most tubercular disease of the hip originates at the upper extremity of the femur tuberculosis generally starting in the head and then attacking the capsule and the soft parts of the joint if neglected shortening of the leg may result in which case the bone has to be broken and set

this is dislocation of the semilunar cartilage and necessitates an operation for removal of the piece the cartilage will eventually be pg replaced by fibrous tissue and in a few months the leg will be all right dislocation of the knee is rare though it may occur in any direction often the bursæ of the joint are irritated as by kneeling to scrub floors and bursitis or housemaid’s knee results fracture of the patella may be caused by muscular traction or by direct violence and is generally repaired by making an incision and sewing the parts of the bone together tumor albus or white swelling is tuberculosis of the knee and is fairly common in children specific knee means syphilis of the knee and generally occurs in both knees the tibia—the tibia or shin bone is next longest to the femur and is on the inner side of the leg corresponding to the ulna in the arm the shaft is prismoid and is more slender for the lower quarter where fracture is consequently most frequent the anterior border forms the crest or shin and can be felt for its upper twothirds the lower extremity which is smaller than the upper articulates with the astragalus bone of the ankle and with the fibula its head or upper extremity is expanded into two lateral tuberositis for articulation with the femur and for muscular attachment both of which can easily be felt just below the bend of the knee their upper surfaces are smooth and concave with a vertical bifid spine in the middle and a prominent tubercle for the attachment of the semilunar cartilages on either side on the anterior surface of the head below is a rough eminence or tubercle which also can be felt the lower part of this is for the attachment of the ligamentum patellæ while the upper part which is smoother is for the bursa that is placed under the tendon to prevent friction on the back of the outer tuberosity is a facet for the head of the fibula at the lower end there projects downward on the inner side overhanging the arch of the foot the internal malleolus the prominent part of the ankle it is on a higher level and somewhat farther forward than the external malleolus the fibula—the fibula is the most slender of all the bones in pg proportion to its length and is on the outer side of the leg its head is small and placed toward the back of the tibia below the kneejoint from which it is excluded the head articulates with the external tuberosity and has extending upward from it the styloid process to it is attached the biceps tendon or outer hamstring at the lower extremity of the shaft is the external malleolus which articulates with the astragalus and forms the outer ankle the only parts of the fibula that can be felt besides the malleolus which is very prominent are the head and the lower external surface of the shaft in fracture of the leg both bones are usually broken though either may be broken separately pott’s fracture is fracture of the lower fibula and may be caused by stamping hard when stepping on to the sidewalk in rickets the tibia becomes bowed outward and forward causing bow leg a condition which in very young children may be rectified by manipulation later on braces are needed and after five years the bones have to be broken and set straight the ankle—the ankle or tarsus has but seven bones where the wrist has eight they are the os calcis or heel bone which is the largest and strongest and forms the tuberosity of the heel; the astragalus which is next largest and helps to form the anklejoint; the cuboid; the navicular boatlike or scaphoid; and the internal middle and external cuneiform bones the astragalus is above and partially in front of the os calcis to which is attached the tendo achillis the cuboid is on the outer side of the foot in front of the os calcis and behind the metatarsals it is noticeable in congenital clubfoot in which condition the tarsal bones may be distorted in shape and misplaced the navicular or scaphoid is on the inner side of the foot between the astragalus and the three cuneiform bones the foot—there are five metatarsal bones in the foot corresponding to the five metacarpals in the hand and the toes have pg the same number of

condyles of the femur and is inserted along with the soleus whose origin is on the back of the upper fibula and the plantaris which comes from the linea aspera into the os calcis by a common tendon the tendo achillis the largest and strongest tendon in the body its action is to extend the foot and to rotate it slightly inward other extensors of the foot which also evert it are the peroneus longus and the peroneus brevis at the upper and outer part of the leg the former rising from the outer tuberosity of the tibia and pg the upper fibula and being inserted into the first metatarsal and the internal cuneiform the latter arising from the lower fibula and being inserted into the fifth metatarsal the foot is flexed adducted and rotated inward by means of the tibialis anticus which rises from the outer tuberosity and the upper twothirds of the outer surface of the tibia and is inserted into the internal cuneiform bone in the foot and corresponding to the palmar fascia in the hand is the plantar fascia the densest of all fibrous membranes there are also various annular ligaments and the foot muscles are arranged similarly to those in the hand the blood supply of the lower extremity—the blood supply of the lower extremity comes from the external iliac artery a branch of the common iliac which passes obliquely downward and outward along the border of the psoas muscle to poupart’s ligament where it enters the thigh and becomes the femoral artery its only important branches are the deep epigastric which goes up along the internal abdominal ring and the deep circumflex iliac as the femoral artery it passes down the inner side of the thigh to the internal condyle of the femur being very superficial at scarpa’s triangle where it can be compressed with the thumb to stop hemorrhage below if a tourniquet is applied it should be applied a little lower down the first and most important branch of the femoral is the profunda femoris about twothirds of the way to the knee the artery takes the name popliteal it lies superficially in the popliteal space back of the knee but above and below it is covered with muscles its branches supply the kneejoint and nearby muscles and are unimportant at the lower border of the popliteus muscle a small muscle at the knee it divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries the course of the former of these may be marked by a line from the inner side of the head of the fibula to midway between the malleoli at the front of pg the ankle where it terminates in the dorsalis pedis artery for the back of the foot by this last the pulse is sometimes taken and its pulsation is a guide in determining how high up to amputate in gangrene of the foot the posterior tibial extends obliquely down the back of the leg to the heel where it divides into the internal and external plantar arteries which go to the sole of the foot its most important branch is the peroneal besides the deep veins accompanying the arteries there are the superficial veins the internal or long saphenous on the inner side of the leg and thigh and the external or short saphenous on the middle of the leg posteriorly and emptying into the popliteal vein varicosity often occurs in these veins nerves—the nerves of the muscles about the hip are branches of the lumbar nerve the anterior crural supplies the anterior part of the thigh the gluteal the muscles of the same name and the great sciatic the large muscles of the back of the thigh below the knee the anterior tibial goes to the tibialis anticus and the internal popliteal to the muscles of the calf while the peroneus muscles are supplied by the musculocutaneous
