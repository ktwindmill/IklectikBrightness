the italic italic type book titles or for which you supply values ix meaning type within a urls code in text that appears on the screen or text that you enter x guide learn the changes between version of the oracle java me and the current version if you need to port earlier to the latest version of the oracle java me runtime you can safely skip this chapter if you have not imlets using version or earlier of the oracle java me topics • • model • device io • generic changes java me is an terms for two new jsrs cldc and meep cldc is a major of cldc while meep is a major of impng java me also support for the new device io api cldc is with cldc but with the java se and core apis and vm java sestyle as well as a generic gcf meep allows of most impng and by the cldc in the and through apis options and more and the device io api defines an api that allows java running on small devices to access devices from a device to the host device to a chip in the host device it is that with the cldc and api the meep and api and the device io api model there are a number of new that object methods must obtain before they can access these are covered in more detail in chapter however should be aware of the • java me now uses java sestyle guide • should request the when any devices to the board through such as gpio ic spi or mmio in to the by the bus they are using • the syntax for the request has changed the request now the device and any actions that are if device eg gpio spi are listed in the of the getting started guide for that board • a single request cannot be used for each must be listed for example you cannot do the open instead you must do this gpio open gpio open in some cases you can use an as a device io the device access api of the oracle java me is now to as the device io api and is no longer part of the package instead all classes now use the jdkdio in • classes that contain have been changed to device so for example has been by and has been by • support now exists for pulse width pwm on all • almost all of the class methods are generic changes the impng classes are now by the generic gcf with jsr and java me profile classes meep with jsr there are a large number of changes that are in these new see the pages online for more on each of these classes device io guide java vm proxy and console from version the oracle java me moves as much cpu away from the java vm as instead a running on the host side across the network with the of the java vm with this design the vm only sends events to the host such as state change methods and objects the is then stored and on host side and the host in turn the to all and tools can treat the java se host as if it was the vm itself besides and goals this efforts on porting to new such as usb serial or instead this vm proxy also known as the agent and the vm proxy channel becomes the tool and cldc meep jsrs and sdk can all take of it topics • design • the vm proxy on the desktop • vm proxy options • using the command line design the vm proxy uses a single to all data for any see figure for an of this design; the vm proxy is the middle java vm proxy and console figure vm proxy and agent design for java be sure not to confuse the vm proxy with the vm agent the vm agent of native code and is located on the device the vm proxy is written in java se and is on the desktop host the proxy also a swm api similar to the package as in the java me profile meep this api is an of the system ams api of of the oracle java me and can be by me sdk ides and the cli to manage with any device the layer between the vm proxy desktop and the vm agent device is by design however it is for tcp serial com port and usb the can in any either from device to host or vise versa the vm proxy on the desktop to use the vm proxy extract the files from your copy of the oracle java me zip archive on the windows desktop the vm proxy program is found as a jar file inside the util of the oracle java me named you can start the vm proxy on the desktop host either in a server or a client mode as below server mode the server mode is used by default in this mode the vm proxy must be started after the java runtime is started on the board then do the change to the util on your desktop host and enter the command you should see an output similar to the java jar socket pi ip address channel closed trying to open socket with device ip address to the socket address port client mode to switch to a client mode perform the steps the vm proxy on the desktop guide edit the file on the board as follows • set the to the client value • set the to the ip address of the host running the agent start the java runtime on the board change to the lib on your desktop host and enter the command you should see an output similar to the java jar with default jdbport channel closed waiting for device on port by default the proxy listens for cli at port on the host the port can be changed by passing the cliport option while the proxy vm proxy options the options are when the vm proxy using the java jar command no options runs proxy with default the host opens a server socket and waits for a from the device this means the java runtime should be started on the device with its file the address of vm proxy socket runs the proxy as a client this means that the device should open a server socket and wait for a from the host the java runtime should be started on the device with its file the setting serial comport – runs the proxy with a serial this means that the vm proxy with device across the serial port debug – adds when the vm proxy is running i – runs cli in the command shell proxy in mode – accepts to cli from any host by default only are host the http proxy address for ip from the proxy proxy port – the http proxy port for ip from the proxy use the help proxy option to preview the list of the options vm proxy options java vm proxy and console using the command line once the vm proxy is running on the desktop you can use the ams cli the easiest way to do this is to start a putty on your desktop and connect to at port this is shown in figure see the getting started guide for your board for on using the command line figure putty the window from port a cli and is shown in figure using the command line guide figure warning the cli feature in this oracle java me release is only as a concept for your it uses with no or the cli are for when a command is only for a it is shown in the imlets on the device usage url this command takes the url the jadjar the url may contain to access the jadjar server eg the jar file using http and then it to device via the tooling channel for jar files only auth the user to access the jadjar server using the command line java vm proxy and console this command may return the install url message about the start of the process install status stage stage message about the success message about the see help the url is not 'dummy see help an was found one or more were found two or more times must be once in url or in auth info twice in url and in auth jar data from url an error while the jar in mode message was aborted for some reason in error message error an error note that this is added for and to avoid amslist shows a list of imlets on the device or in the suite if no are the amslist command will return a list of all suites if a suite's index or are used the command will list the suite's midlets usage amslist index or this command takes the index the suite via its index number using the command line guide the suite via its name and vendor this command may return the were found suites are no suites were found on the device suites are list of suites with details parsing the suite's index failed or the was missed found the suite was not found midlets are in list of the midlets in the suite note that each suite status can be running or stopped amsinfo the suite usage amsinfo index this command takes the index the suite via its index number this command may return the see help number of the is less or more than using the command line java vm proxy and console is closed to the device is closed found the suite is not found or removed during command getting info list of updates the suite usage index or this command takes the index the index of the suite to be updated to obtain the suite index use the amslist command the suite to be updated via its name and vendor auth the user to access the jadjar server note the suite's index or is and must be placed first this command may return the see help missing the suite's index or is not see help an was found see help a was found using the command line guide update suite url is not the url is not for suites in mode see the command found suite not found either the suite was removed or the index was install url message about the update process install status stage stage message about the update success message about the update process message the update was aborted for some reason as in the error message error an error note that this is added for and to avoid removes the suite from device usage index or this command takes the index the index of the suite to be removed to obtain the suite index use the amslist command the suite to be removed via its name and vendor this command may return the using the command line java vm proxy and console see help missing suite's index or not the suite was removed found the suite was not found either the suite has been already removed or the was the suite is locked and cannot be removed the suite is likely in the running state the amsstop command must be called first allowed the user doesn't have to remove suites amsrun run default suite's midlet or midlet wit miletid usage amsrun index or id this command takes the index index of suite to be run to obtain the suite index use the amslist command the suite to be via its name and vendor id the index of midlet in the suite to be run this command may return

default midlet or the midlet with the id if given usage amsstop index or id this command takes the index index of suite to be stopped to obtain the suite index use the amslist command the suite to be stopped via its name and vendor id the id of midlet in the suite to be stopped this command may return the were found found cannot stop the midlet the index of the suite or midlet was the suite was stopped clients and usage client name app this command takes the using the command line java vm proxy and console name the name of the client to be the suite to be via its name and vendor this command may return the were found status ok the command was shows the list of names of which control java me runtime common to the file note that a type may be only int string or bool the flag value may be only or read only and a bool value may be only true or false usage l this command takes the l use the long listing format with types values and flags this command may return the btgoep btlcap btspp cbs the without the long listing flag shows names by a space using the command line guide int = int = string = user string = read only bool = false read only bool = false the with the long listing flag l of which control java me runtime l use a long listing format an was found is no found an empty list of was found is closed an has shows the value of if the is not defined the command shows an empty string as its value usage name i this command takes the name the name i this command may return the = true the was found without using the command line java vm proxy and console = the value is empty or not a set without bool = true the is found with i flag string = the value is empty or not a set with i flag name i value of string 'name' i display info an was found the wrong flag format was usedeg using info instead of i is closed an has = = the was with the command the new value will be after you restart the device sets the new value for the if the the java me runtime ie it is defined in the file it cannot be unless the flag is note that are for type the value of a bool may be any string however only true case is a true value; any other string is to be false the new value for a that the java me runtime will be applied only after a vm reboot in this case only the latest command will have an effect after reboot new values for other can be read just after the command has usage name value this command takes the name the name of the value the new value for the this command may return the using the command line guide = the number hello the value type is not a number when type is int or true the is wrong number of is closed an has when you modify a by using the command and verify the change with the command the cli both old and new values as shown in the example the new value will be after you restart the device = = changes will take effect after device restart = = saves to an storage usage this command takes no this command may return the have been saved to the storage an has using the command line java vm proxy and console netinfo show the network of the system this command only works on ioe devices usage netinfo this command takes no this command may return the getting info shows network in the format is closed an has netset sets a new value for the of the network system the is for type this command only works on ioe devices usage netset name

devices the current the seleted device that all cli command are to were found in this case the command has no but the user has some the device once changed all further will be address to the newly device usage index this command takes the index an integer index of device as printed by the command this command may return the using the command line guide device is changed the command has been the current device was changed an invalid number of have been either no or more than one device index the index is not an integer not found there is no such device device is already current an attempt was made to switch to a device that is already the current device or restart the device usage r this command takes the r restart the device note that restart is not on win this command may return the will

please see the device io api and the at the site signing the with api first the jad file must have the proper api here is how to sign the both in and without an ide • in the project name and choose select then in the pane select api click the add button and add the as shown in figure click ok to close the project dialog figure adding using the ide • if you are not using an ide you can modify the file to contain the open method # signing using the ide the ide enables both to sign the with a local and upload the on the device see the getting started guide for your to learn how to use the ide to sign your guide method # signing using a command line signing using a command line is the route for that are widely here are the on how to setup a with a local that can be used to sign the a new with the command on the desktop using the keytool that is shipped with the oracle java se jdk keytool genkey v alias mycert spass keypass kpass keyalg rsa keysize dname this command a bit rsa key pair and a placing them in a new with a of spass and a key of kpass that is valid for days you can change both as desired copy the certs from the board over to the desktop using an sftp client or scp command change into the certs and perform the command using the command or java jar if your only that that ships with the oracle java me sdk import mainks spass alias mycert domain trusted this command imports the in that you just created to the mainks after this is copy the certs back to the board by using an sftp client or scp command use the to sign your before it to the board jadtool addcert alias myalias spass to sign with the sha add the usesha if not present the default is used jadtool jarfile alias myalias spass keypass kpass usesha method # using this method allows to bypass a check and execute as if they were signed and given all this method should be used only for and final testing must be done using a real as in method # to use set the in the file on the board = note that the java runtime must not be running when editing the file cldc the are that affect the use of of the cldc the access to a file or a of a and a set of actions that are valid for the by that name the name

table shows the runtime that are allowed as well as their effects and risks of using them table actions value effect risks status halting of the java virtual machine jvm with the exit status this allows an to mount a attack by forcing the virtual machine to halt note that the exitvm is granted to all code loaded from the class path thus to also the exitvm is to exitvm setting of the manager an manager the manager is a class that allows to a policy the would allow code to change which manager is used by a less manager thereby checks that would have been by the manager ger of a new manager this gives code access to methods that may about other classes or the stack setio setting of and this allows the value of the system streams an may set to a null which would hide any error sent to of threads via calls to perform thread or and setname methods this allows an to modify the of any thread in the system cldc the is a which the manager will check when code that is running with a manager calls one of the logging control methods such as there is only one without or actions this simply grants the ability to control the logging for example by adding or by adding or filters or by logging

these apis for oracle java me as given in the package there are five and six classes in this package that can be used by to enhance in there are a number of that are present in the these are near the classes and methods that use them this chapter is a that data for an that is an app or a link the of two methods both of which are called at certain times during one is the method which only a single code the of which can be found in the the other is the method which the current task as one of the that are shown in table and an integer of table name done has install stage body install stage data install stage storing install stage storing install stage content here are the two method defined in the • void this method is called by the to report that the has the integer code is in the class see for more about error codes • void tracker status int percent this method is called by the to inform the of the current status of the install the stage is given by an integer as shown in table the percent is an integer between and is an that a that the current state of a suite has changed there is only one method defined in the • void tracker this method is called to notify a that the current state of a suite has changed a to the current is as well as an of which the new state the of only seven methods that add or remove suites add or remove suite a list of the suites or the current • void this method adds a object to the current • suite vendor name this method returns an of the suite • int offset int length boolean this method returns the current • boolean this method returns the current • type this method a list of suites of type • void suite boolean this method removes a suite • void this method removes a the is an used to receive updates about a task that is running • void task guide this method is called when the current task has a new status update to report the method passes a to the task in as well as a object the new status the is an used to manage the tasks • void throws this method adds a • task throws this method returns the current task that is running • this method obtains a list of task objects if system tasks are to be that can be with the boolean • void this method removes a • boolean task throws this method assigns the task to be the running task a task is said to be in the if the lui api or another ui api is and the task is visible on the display or if the key api is and input device events will be to it if none of those is by the a call to this method has no effect • boolean task throws changes the for the given task the method returns true if the change was or false • task suite string throws starts a task from the given class name in the given suite this method throws an if suite is a library and can not be started calling this method a new the new task is created with on success or on failure more than one call to this method can be with the same in this case calls lead to to restart the task in case of attempt to restart the task an is thrown or the state is set to the task object • boolean task throws this method cancels an that is in it returns true if the was or false class the class is a global factory that is used to obtain a or a • static this method returns an of a • static this method returns an of a the suite class all imlet suites a basic set of and state that acts as a this is by the suite class suites can be one of four types in the and shown in table table suite type the suite one or more midlets with an entry point that can be the suite is a library that can be used by one or more the suite is a the suite is invalid and cannot be found or in suites contain binary flags that their state in the and shown in table table state the suite is for use enabled the suite is enabled when a suite is any attempt to run or use a library from this suite should fail system the suite is a suite the suite is a suite that cannot be updated the suite should not be removed the suite should not be updated the are method present in the suite class • getname class guide this method returns the name for the given suite • this method returns the vendor for the given suite • this method returns the version of the given suite • this method returns the url that the jad or jar was from • this method returns a string array that the names of the the are those from the jad file and the into a single array • name this method the value for the name • this method returns the suite type see table for more • public boolean state this method checks the current state boolean to see if it is true • public void state boolean value throws this method sets the flag to the value if a suite has been created and are always set to true while and are set to false these states can be changed by calling this method the and flags are only set for system suites or suites and cannot be unset or set by this method to be able to set suite flags caller should request or see for more details • public this method returns a list of the class names in this suite the first in the is the default as in the midlet field of the • public this method returns a list of the shared this suite depends on • public boolean checks if this suite is trusted or not the return value is always true if it is a • public boolean the suite class checks if this suite is still or has been removed class the class is a global factory that is used to obtain a or a • void this method adds a to this suite • void this method removes a to this suite • start this method starts of the suite the can be the first of this suite or a update of a suite that had been before a must be added in order to handle method returns an of the caller can observe the of the via the added please note that the method may not return quickly on the used in the of meep it may be to the entire jar data first in order to inspect the of the suite in order to find out whether this is a new or an update of an suite on the network this may take some timein case the attempt to install this suite by a call of the start method has not been at the time the new call takes place the call is queued and the new attempt to install in case the first one failed or the in case the first call was starts as soon as the first attempt or has been new of will be created for every call to this method and to the suite to be as soon as the has been in case of an update of an suite the is to the suite object from the the does not have the right the will fail with • void cancel begins of the suite class an of this class is as soon as an or update of a suite is started using that method creates a new tracker whether two refer to the same suite can be found out by calling for both and compare the suite the tracker created for a is passed to any call of in order to inform about the of this for the of a new suite as long as the hasn't been an of is not to any suite yet as it does not exit yet in these cases a call to returns null class guide in case of an update the tracker is to the suite from the though this class has one method • suite this method returns the suite that this tracker is to if the has class the for swm api an object a scope and actions the scope

the and commas in the list are not allowed and lead to an the values can be seen in this table in the policy chapter of the spec the actions string is to before this class has one and several methods • scope actions this method creates a new object with the name and actions • public boolean p this method checks if the is implied by this object • string this method returns the actions of this as a comma list in order • this method creates a new task class the task class is in effect a simple task a task is the of the of an see tasks are started using the method where the specify the suite and the class within the suite being the point of the a new task to execute a task has a status as in the that state a task has a with values as in on whether the vms several tasks can run in are special tasks called system tasks those tasks cannot be started or stopped via this api but are started by the class system the method can be used to find out whether a task is a a system task the task class the methods • string getname this is a method for the name of the task the string is the name of the running in this task • this method returns the of given task • public int this method returns the heap use of given task • public this method returns the task's status • public suite this method returns the suite this task from • public boolean this method returns a boolean whether a task is a

general purpose gpio in the oracle java me product gpio refers a generic pin on an board whose whether it is an input or output pin can be by the user at runtime gpio pins are often lined up in rows by design they have no purpose and are used by for a wide variety of tasks for example • gpio pins can be enabled or • gpio pins can be to be input or output • input values are often with a a high voltage and a a low voltage • input gpio pins can be used as lines which allow a board via pins to signal to the primary board that it • output pin values are both and warning be sure to observe and for example with the pi board the voltage value that a high value on an input pin may be volts +v however other pins may output volts +v be sure to check the to ensure that you are not placing too much voltage on an input gpio line as the board may not have an gpio pins have much greater than this but it is to start with the basics setting a gpio output pin for this example you will need the table for gpio example where to obtain pi mb rev b b+ or pi various sellers various dtb used in the example general purpose perhaps the example of working with the gpio in the oracle java me product is to set the highlow value of an output pin and read its voltage with a in this example we set the value of gpio pin to between high v and low v at of seconds and seconds the example shows the source code import import import import import import import public class extends midlet gpiopin pin; public void try pin = gpiopin for int i = ; i ; i++ pin to true; pin to false; catch ex null ex; catch ex null ex; public void public void try catch ex null ex; setting a gpio output pin guide the must be added to the of the imlet so that it will execute without any from the oracle java me runtime table for gpio example device gpio open note that if you're using an ide such as as the you will need to access the project of the project and set api under the as shown in figure figure api in the in after running the set your to read dc voltage with a maximum of v then connect one of the leads of the to gpio and the other to gnd ground as the is running note that the voltage that is read by the will jump from its low value of around v after a call to to its high value of around v after a call to this is shown in figure and figure warning that the gpio pin on the pi do not match the pin numbers on the board for example gpio is not mapped to pin but instead pin see a or the getting started guide for the pin for the target boards of the oracle java me setting a gpio output pin general purpose figure pi pin with low v voltage figure pi pin with high v voltage working with a when it is often helpful to have a way of wires without having to perform in some cases if there are only a few you can use jumper wires however when layout out more complex it's helpful to use a a typical is shown in figure working with a guide figure a typical a of a large number of holes each of which are wired on the bottom using a pattern such as the one shown in figure note that the two columns on both the left and the right of the are wired provide power + and ground that can be tapped into to the rows on either side of the center line on the other hand are used to create can be created using small wires with metal tips on each end that can plug into the holes working with a general purpose figure wiring pattern for a typical for the pi we can connect the gpio pins on the pi to a using a device called a board this device a ribbon cable to the gpio pins which in turn to the board the board is then into the top of the as shown in figure working with a guide figure board for the pi once to the pi you can use any of the holes running along the red stripe on the left side of the to provide + volts v or any of the holes running along the red stripe on the right side of the to provide + volts v in any of the holes running along the blue stripes on either side of the board connect to the ground gnd on the pi the gpio pins on the pi map to the pins on the and hence the rows on the as shown in figure working with a general purpose table gpio to gpio pi pin number name pin sda pin scl pin p pin ce pin ce pin miso pin mosi pin sclk pin txd pin rxd pin p pin p pin p pin p pin p pin p an led we can use the code in the first example to create a small circuit on the that turns on an off a diode led for this example you will need the table needed for led example where to obtain led any store ohm any store and jumper wires male to male use the to connect one end of a ohm to a row that to gpio which is marked on the by ce plug the other end of the ohm an led guide into an unused row further down the then run an led from that row an row and then connect that row to the ground gnd the circuit should look similar to the in figure figure for wiring an led to gpio when you should have a that looks like figure run the first example again and you should see the led light off an on the call is made on the gpiopin object note that an led is a diode which by only allows current to travel one way through it if your led does not light up when the voltage is applied try the so that the current travels the reverse through the diode an led general purpose figure wiring an led to gpio pin testing output and input pins our next gpio example will take the output voltage from one pin and it back to an input pin while a on the input pin that reacts for this example you will need the testing output and input pins guide table for example where to obtain pi mb rev b various sellers various dtb used in the example here we use gpio and on the pi due to their to each other these pins are right next to gpio and gnd which was used in the example in the example below we've added a to an input pin that will trigger the input voltage changes in both and import import import import import import import import import public class extends midlet gpiopin pin; gpiopin pin; public void

purpose public void public void try catch ex null ex; class public void event try for pin has been is now + catch ex null ex; table shows the that must be added to the of the imlet so that it will execute without any from the oracle java me runtime table for example device open after running the either connect one of the leads of the to the gpio pin and the other to the gpio pin of the pi or create a circuit on a set your to read dcv with a maximum of mv as the is running note that the voltage that is read by the will jump from its low value to its high voltage the will be much smaller than that from gpio try the lead from gpio and it when gpio is high the output of the program should reflect that the is called both when the lead is and when it is warning that the gpio pin on the pi do not match the pin numbers on the board for example gpio is not mapped to pin but instead pin gpio is mapped to pin see a testing output and input pins guide and b for the pin for the target boards of the oracle java me the output of the when running in is shown in figure figure output of example testing output and input pins general purpose testing output and input pins guide working with the ic bus the ic bus often to as ic or is a bus used between and ic uses only two lines serial data line sda and serial clock scl often with typical used are + v or + v systems with other are when using the pi be sure to check the as to which are for the the pi both v and v pins to enable ic on the pi add the lines to the files and reboot note that the file will need to be edited with root icbcm icdev with a segment display for this you will need the table for segment display example where to obtain pi mb rev b b+ or pi various sellers digit segment display with htk ic adafuit or amazon a small amount of of the led display unit to ic logic board as well as ic pins jumper wires female to female x store we used pn rev a our first example allows us to use the gpio and gpio pins for the ic data and clock using these we will write a simple program that allows us to set the display using an ic in order to hook up the segment display to the pi the jumper wires must be as shown in table note that because there are only four we opted not to use a tcobber and a in this example table pi to htk jumper pins on pi htk board v pin vcc working with the ic bus table cont pi to htk jumper pins

rate of the segment display to one of four values off hz hz or hz finally we can set the of the display using a value of to for the latter two we make use of the next two methods which can also be called the and methods simply take an input value perform bounds and the correct byte value to send across the bus just like turning on the we only need to send one byte across the bus to modify the blink rate or to any level we choose the method on the other hand is a little more complex here the class makes use of an array of as a field that serves as a display with a segment display guide buffer in reality the method will any value larger then before sending it across the bus but making it an array of is helpful for the user each of the entries in the array will map to an address on the htk led that can be written to using the ic bus the purpose of each of the is shown in table note that since the htk can drive types of led several of the are ignored when using this segment display table htk segment display address purpose x segment display and period x ignored x segment display and period x ignored x colon xff for colon on; x for colon off x ignored x segment display and period x ignored x segment display and period x ignored each address can have one byte written to it the of each byte is mapped out in binary as shown in figure as such the number with a decimal point is in binary as which is equal to x in note that address x is for the colon that appears between the first two numbers and the second two numbers in the it does not figure binary for segment

result of running the segment display imlet with a x lcd display for this you will need the table for example where to obtain pi mb rev b b+ or pi various sellers x lcd display with an hd amazon a small amount of for the pins that run on the top of the logic board pcfn bit io chip mouser and store jumper wires store this example uses the ic bus to to an lcd display with a hitachi hd the hdbased x lcds are and widely however in to the lcd display we must also use a pcf based ic which is an general purpose bit io port that uses the ic the first step is to hook up the pi to the pcf chip an ic

the pins are used to set the slave address on ic bus # as a binary digit from a= a= a= that is added to the value of x because we are not running voltage on any of these pins the address of the pcfn chip on the ic bus should remain x if you'd like to verify this login to the pi and issue the command shown in figure here the command shows that on bus there is a device at address x to change the

link that in full duplex mode in other words data can be sent and at the same time devices in mode where the master device the data with one or more slaves slave devices are allowed with slave select lines the spi bus four logic signals • sclk serial clock a clock signal that is sent from the master • mosi master output slave input data sent from the master to the slave • miso master input slave output data sent from the slave to the master • ss slave select sent from the master active on low signal often paired with the chip select cs line on an circuit that spi in order to enable the spi bus on the pi the entry spibcm in the file note that you will need to have root to edit the file using the spi bus to with an adc because the pi board does not come with a the spi bus can be used to with a chip that is reading an analog signal for this you will need the table for example where to obtain pi mb rev b various sellers texas tlccp bit adc various we used and adafuit see chapter for more store jumper wires mm and ff store the serial spi bus the data sheet of the tlccp shows pins as shown in figure note that the spi reside on the right side of the chip while the for the analog

made! the board as a secure server guide a java me this covers common when working with java me devices many of these are common to the cldc vm in both java and java me design systems are to perform a task unlike a that strives to handle tasks with equal some systems also have for safety and others may have little or no the system to be to reduce costs as such should use the design to avoid the system memory are limited in devices often memory is the most many devices have memory that is in mb and some of it is used by the runtime system rtos leaving the for use by the java vm and its be aware of how much memory is used by your the rtos and the java vm this will vary from one board to another by the time a java me all memory and is subject to an there are few options left the must either force the vm to free any memory using a call or if that doesn't work crash threads java threads are often an with java vms java work best when using minimal threads if you must create code be sure to the use of code which can be on devices as a general rule avoid using the timer class as an extra thread is created for each timer a common for java me is to create a thread in the method of the midlet class and reuse it the imlet system system should never block and should return as soon as to avoid slowing down the cldc vm pay special to the midlet methods • java me a • • midlet the record system rms is an io that should be used with any that uses objects opening and closing should be in strive to group reads and writes in one section of code as much as read and writes across the can slow down the another common when working with objects is to use buffers which reside in memory and are often faster this is a common • for reading record stores read the entire record into a buffer then parse the buffer • for writing record stores write to a single buffer then write the buffer to a record general tips here are some other general hints for your code that are the for java me code • object is very costly with respect to memory and create objects only when needed and reuse any object that are created in a cache • use lazy if however many java me will create all objects outside the main loop of the program and reuse them as the runs with objects be sure to include a method that returns them to the state of the object • avoid when • do not perform in tight loops • avoid using varargs • use local instead of global when you can local are faster and less • only include system classes that you need avoid using wild imports like import instead import classes such as import • don't perform string using the + use the class instead for example don't do the string str = new string hello ;str += world; instead do this str = new hello that in java string objects are so with the + will in fact create a copy the of the string over append the other string then copy the result back into a string object a guide • divide your arrays into arrays arrays take more time to the proper index in memory • avoid any and of objects and inside loops for example avoid a like this for int i = ; i length; i++ c = new = • use a instead of if blocks as they are into more that with java the switch keyword can handle strings which is more that a large number of if blocks that test using the equals method • use public instead of using getset • set to null when you don't need them anymore to assist with garbage size aside from the number of classes in your can also make use of tools which are present in and other idess the purpose of an is to make reverse more however it can also create smaller and often faster class files in fact reduce java me class file size by % to % the ide an option to install the library you can choose this option by on your project and up the project next expand the build leaf and select if is not already press the button to and install the module as shown in figure a size java me a figure a the library once the is choose an level by moving the slider from level and level as shown in figure a each level a in the window below that shows what the is figure a an level size a guide b java me this the options that are found in many ports of the oracle java me product system in the oracle java me can be in one of two ways by the file if or by using the vm proxy cli the file most have a file that can be with a text editor the file has two • that are used by java that are running on the board • used for system in each file that help the purpose of each entry it is highly that you read through the file for your target board as it about each note that the oracle java me runtime may alter the values inside of the file at any time if the and are issued in the cli and without so it helps to study the version that comes with each bundle using the in to in the file system can also be on the fly using the cli command the command uses the syntax key value if you wish to examine the current value of any use the command key note that after any change the vm state is and it is to issue the command and r' or on the board cycle the power to the changes see chapter for more on using the vm proxy cli java me b the list of system differs on each and with each release and may be by issuing the command via the cli proxy for example the list that is for the pi would look similar to the read only string = string = bool = false read only string = appdb bool = false int = read only string = appdb read only string socket = string = null several lines omitted int = using the b guide c signing an imlet suite's jar file trust is for imlet suites that use apis signing an imlet suite's jar file allows the suite to be trusted a jar file is signed with the jadtool utility a copy of the jadtool utility is with the oracle java me bundle the jadtool utility signs a jar file by adding a and the jar file's digital to a java jad file adding a and a jar file's digital to a jad file are steps you must both steps to sign a jar file the steps are in for using you can also use the jadtool utility to obtain about a in a jad file the can include the name of the entity that issued the the serial number the dates between which it is valid and its message digest md and secure hash sha for using jadtool this section how to use the jadtool utility through an example that signs a imlet suite named note is not an actual imlet suite no files are with this release the example uses the key pair with the the key pair is in the file which is a managed with the java se keytool utility for on the keytool utility see http after you build an of the is located in this where is the that the output of your builds of the oracle java me the for the file is the alias of the key pair is dummyca the private key is keypwd the file is for testing for imlet suites on enduser devices use an rsa key pair backed by a or chain from a you must import the or chain into a java se with the java se keytool utility signing an imlet suite's jar file c the jadtool utility is in a jar file named in this where is the base of the oracle java me using the jadtool utility open a windows command prompt change your current to the that holds your imlet's jar and jad files add the for your key pair to the jad file using the jadtool utility the jadtool utility adds the as the value of an named where m is the number of the chain it to one but you can provide a number with the switch and n is an integer that for new begins at one and by one each time you add a new to the jad file for example if is the command adds the as the value of the to the example jad file jar addcert alias dummyca verify that the is added to the jad file by using the jadtool utility to list the in the jad file jar certnum subject c=us st=ca l=santa clara o=dummy ca ou=jct issuer c=us st=ca l=santa clara o=dummy ca ou=jct serial number decea valid from wed jul pdt to sat jul pdt md sha if you have a key pair backed by a chain import the import the using the jadtool utility with the addcert switch shown in step taking care to use the correct chain order for example the xxxx company a that vouches for your key pair the company vouches for the xxxx and vouches for the import the xxxx by the the xxxx is and the is using the jadtool utility c guide note you do not import the of the root ca in this example the is from the root is on the device sign the jar file using the jadtool utility the jadtool utility signs the jar file base encodes the and stores it as the value of the of the output jad file note the key used to sign the jar file must be from the same java se entry as key pair in step the jadtool utility does not check that the jar file is signed with a entry that has a in the jad file for example jar alias dummyca keypass keypwd jarfile you can sign a jar file with a jad using the usesha command line switch for example java jar usesha alias dummyca keypass keypwd jarfile expired a jad file can have but it can hold the for only one jar file when a in the jad file expires you must add a new and resign the jar file when the jar file the jadtool utility the current digital with the new one options summary the jadtool utility the options • none running the tool without options returns the same as the help option • addcert alias certnum adds a to a jad file to add a this utility first creates the from the entry by in the if must be a java a file data such as key expired signing an imlet suite's jar file c entries in a format that the java se can use if is not its default is used if a to access its must be after the and name this utility the of with the new and writes it as you can use the same file for the and the is in the jad file as the value of an named where • m is or if it is not a jad file can contain chain • n is the value depends on whether the new an if the is a then must be the number of the to replace for example if the new would replace the one stored as the value of then must be if the is new is ignored if uses an other than utf ascii with unicode escapes must be this utility uses the same for reading and writing • usesha jarfile jarfile alias keypass creates a digital for jarfile if jarfile

the value of the where m is or if it is not this number to the value for m in the if uses an other than utf ascii with unicode escapes must be this utility uses the same for reading and writing • help prints a usage summary • certnum all options summary c guide prints about either all or the that to the given and in the the option all cannot be with the certnum and options the of a is the m in the jad file's while the is the n for example to show the that is the value of the must be and must be if or are not and the all option is not used the utility uses a the printed the subject issuer serial number dates between which it is valid and md and sha the in the subject and issuer names are shown in reverse order from what is in the a side effect of using the java se api as a result the names might not match what is from other tools that display a subject and issuer names if uses an other than utf ascii with unicode escapes must be the tool uses the same for reading and writing options summary signing an imlet suite's jar file c options summary c guide d keys and the oracle java me uses public keys from a ca to web sites and signed imlet suites the oracle java me also uses private keys from to secure with client when the uses a secure to access a web site the site a which is signed by a ca in the same manner signed imlet suites also contain a that is signed by a ca the oracle java me checks the of a by using the ca's public key by signing a a ca the of the owner of the web site or imlet suite you can manage the ca public keys and private keys on the board by using the utility the utility is with the java me sdk and is similar to the keytool utility with the java se except that will also operate across a network on the of an device that is by the oracle java me device manager this chapter how to use to manage that are used by the oracle java me or by the oracle java me sdk device manager running is an that can be found in the where is the base of the oracle java me to connect to a on an board instead of the add the xdevice option to a device by the oracle java me device manager warning each board may only accept a limited subset of on the offered to list the by the device for example you can use the xquery option xquery keys and d using the utility open a command prompt or window change your current to the of the exe file shown above or add the to your current %path% run with the options needed for example use the command to display help help me the utility keeps the ca public keys and private keys in an me on the device the is at the where basedir is the base of the oracle java me or oracle java me sdk table d of device boards if file system is this an index file named mainks and a set of files the the key of one ca warning oracle does not the default but instead a copy either one that is or in the working for the device working for the when the oracle java me is first started it creates a working in note that this is only the case for devices such as not devices that map to actual boards such as next it copies all and several other files there be aware that the working removes all device and of course any to the local note the utility enables you to import keys from java se however you cannot use the utility on a java se for example if you try to use the utility to view public keys in a java se the utility an error message that the is an me has a format java se using the utility d guide which have a format in with the java and me in to the public keys in the me you can use the utility to manage me both with the and some boards that contain an for example during testing you might want to have to run against one could contain all the testing keys a second could contain a subset of the testing keys and a third could contain an expired key me the utility does not create a new me the must create an empty first of a and an empty mainks file which can be copied from the with the bundle see a key for on how to import a key me to manage a other than the default use the import option import for example if you created an me that the keys that are needed to run a set of tests use the command to manage that import for all you receive an error message if the file that you provide as an to does not exist a key you can add a key to an me by it from the java that comes with the java se or from a that you create for more on the that comes with the java se see the file name for the java se is and the default is in your home this file is created if you use the java se keytool utility to create keys and you do not specify a the utility this unless you use the to specify a note if you use a java se other than the default the new might require a the import option imports a key for example to add a key with an alias dummyca from the java se that has a a key keys and d to the me at import alias dummyca if it is to import a with a private key from a file in pkcs format for example with the and the key keypwd use the command import keypass keypwd listing keys an me the keys that it by giving each one a number for each key the also holds the name of the entity to whom the public key belongs the time over which the key is valid and the domain with the key the list command for each key in a the example lists the of the me list key owner public primary valid from mon jan msk to wed aug msd domain enabled true key owner valid from sat aug pdt to tue jul pdt domain enabled true the example lists of the of the me on a pi device listed as again note that the device must already be with the device manager

public key of a test site with a during testing you can delete that key when testing is the delete command to the utility removes a key from an me the delete command one of the options • owner sets the string that the owner of the public key in a given use the list command to print about each key in the the string in the command must match the one printed when you use the list command to the utility see listing keys for more • number sets the number that a given has to each of its keys the number is greater than or equal to one use the list command to print the number that the has to each of its keys see listing keys for more the show two ways to delete a key from the me the used in listing keys • a key by using its key delete number mykeys a key keys and d • a key by using its owner delete owner public primary a key some require that you replace a key such as when a key expires to replace a key first delete the old key then import the new key note if you import the new key before the old one the utility an error message that the owner of the key has a key in the me summary the utility the options • no option runs the tool without options and returns the same as the help option

england and on the for the purpose of to make myself with the various of art i was led to apply to them those of to which my other had given rise the number of curious and facts which thus came under my as well as of the which they induced me to believe that the of some of them might be of use to persons who propose to bestow their on those which i have only with this view it was my to have the present work in the form of a course of at an which i was induced to alter the of a portion of it has however among the of the part of the i have not to offer a of all the which the of to arts and but i have to present to the reader those which struck me as the most either for the actions of or for the memory to and arrange the facts with their still less have i to examine all the of economy which are with such it was not to trace or to imagine among the wide variety of facts to me some which seemed to pervade many and having formed such the desire to refute or to verify them gave an to the pursuit several of the which i have appear to me to have been before this was the case with respect to the i have given of the of labour; but further enquiry me that i had been by m gioja and it is that would enable me to trace most of the other which i had thought to writers to whose merit i may perhaps be unjust from my want of with the branch of the subject the truth however of the i have stated is of much more than their origin; and the utility of an enquiry into them and of others more correct if these should be can admit of a doubt the of the of has been greatly to examine them with the eye of a so as to be able to direct others to repeat them does require much skill and with the but merely to their general and mutual is within the power of almost every person a those who possess rank in a country can be excused if they are of whose has its the of wealth can be to which nearly or have been the fertile source of their those who enjoy leisure can find a more and pursuit than the of the of their own country which contain within them a rich mine of too by the classes it has been my as much as to avoid all terms and to in concise the arts i have had to discuss in on the more of economy after shortly stating the reasons on which they are founded i have to support them by facts and so that whilst young persons might be amused and by the those of more may find subject for in the general to which they point i was anxious to support the which i have by the of others and in this respect i found myself the reports of of the house of commons upon various of and and the which they have at periods on those teem with of the most kind doubly by the under which it has been from these sources i have freely taken and i have derived some from the support they have to my views charles babbage dorset street square june i am happy to avail myself of this of my to the right hon manners sutton the speaker of the house of commons to whom i am for copies of a of those reports preface to the second edition in two months from the of the first edition of this volume three copies were in the hands of the public very little was spent in the instead of aiding impeded its sale; it formed no part of any popular series and yet the public in a few weeks the whole edition some small part of this success perhaps was due to the popular of those curious which are carried on in our and to the to take a short view of the general which direct the of the country but the chief reason was the of the subject and the desire to become with the and of that portion of the people which has so large an of i had good of this fact from various and being of it i myself applied for a copy at the shop of a of who is not aware that he refused to procure one even for its author a greater degree of than i had has been excited by what i have stated in the first edition the until i had the chapter 'on the cost of each process of a i had no of to that subject but the reader will that i have this volume i could as objects of easy access to the reader; and in with that i the volume itself when i arrived at the chapter 'on of masters against the public' i was induced for the same reason to expose a with which in my opinion is both morally and wrong i entered upon this enquiry without the feeling of to that trade nor have i any wish to it; but i think a reform in its system would add to its and as the subject of that chapter has been much i have thought it right to take a view of the various which have been and to offer my own opinion their there i should have left the subject content to allow my general to plead for me against my as the remarks of some of my critics affect the of another person i think it but just to state which will clearly them mr of ludgate street who had been the of some other volumes for me had the of the first edition of the present work a short time to its i thought it right to call his to the chapter in which the is with the view both of making him with what i had stated and also of myself of his in any error as to the facts mr from me the i had arrived at' then the of the volume if i had then chosen to apply to some of those other whose names appear in the of 'the trade' it is that they also would have the office of for me; and had my object been to make a case against the trade such a course would have me but i had no such and having a copy of the whole work i called with it on mr knight of pall mall east whom until that day i had never seen and with whom i had never had the i left the book in mr hands with a request that when he had read it i might be whether he would the of it; and this he to do mr knight is so far from being for a single opinion in the present volume that he saw it only for a short time a few days to its it has been to me that i have exposed too freely the secrets of trade the only real secrets of trade are and to the of these no can be and they never fail to produce respect and wealth the in the present edition are so that i found it to them in a but the three new 'on money as a medium of 'on a new system of and 'on the effect of in the demand for will shortly be printed for the use of the of the first edition i am to attach some to the new system of and venture to throw it out with the hope of its a full among those who are most in the subject i believe that some such system of would greatly the powers of any country it; and that our own much greater for its than other in the greater and of the working classes the system would in some large town by the union of some of the most prudent and active and their example if would be by others the small would next join them and such would go on until the large to adopt the same system; and the whole of every man engaged in would be upon one art of a good article at the lowest the moral effect on that class of the would be useful in the highest degree since it would render of far greater value to the workman than it is at present to one which has been made this volume is open i have the subject of the in a few lines the subject in my opinion great and i have been to write upon it because i do not see my way i will only here advert to one what an few simple are new; and most may be viewed as species and classed under genera of more or less and may in be old or new to the of the person who gives his opinion some of my critics have amused their readers with the of the schemes i have thrown out; and i myself have smiled along with them perhaps it were wiser for present to offer nothing but plans but i do not think will be most by that course; such sparks may kindle the of other minds more for the thus i have now to give some on the mode of blowing for iron; and even them to be it is of some thus to call the of a large engaged in one of our most to the fact that of the steam power used to blow their cools them i have with some pains the on the first edition of this work and have availed myself of much which has been to me by my friends for the of the present volume if i have in what i had to explain with i am aware that much of this is due to my friend dr fitton to whom both the present and the former edition are for such an and as an author himself has very rarely the power to bestow several of these have escaped me and i shall feel to any one who will inform my of any future remarks section i the object of the present volume is to point out the effects and the which arise from the use of tools and to their modes of to trace both the causes and the of to the skill and power of the human arm a view of the part of the subject will in the first occupy our and to this the first section of the work will be devoted the first chapter of the section will contain some remarks on the general sources from whence the of are derived and the nine will contain a of of a less general the chapter and is from the it affords of the arts in which copying is so largely the twelfth chapter which the first section a few for the of those who propose the second section after an chapter on the between making and will contain in the a of many of the which relate to the economy of the subject it was found that the or economy of was so with the more general that it was deemed to the two the chapter of this section and of the work itself relates to the future of as arising from the of science chapter sources of the arising from and there exists perhaps no single which our country more from all others than the vast extent and to which we have carried the of tools and for forming those of which so large a is by almost every class of the the amount of patient thought of of happy of genius by which our have been created and carried to their present is to be if we look around the rooms we inhabit or through those of every of every luxury that man can desire which deck the crowded streets of our larger cities we shall find in the history of each article of every fabric a series of which have led the way to and we shall notice in the art of making even the most of them to excite our by their or to rivet our by their results the of skill and science which has been to the of goods has not been to that country alone in which it is distant have in its the natives of the east and the ruder of the african desert are alike to our looms the produce of our has even our most the cotton of india is by british ships round half our planet to be woven by british skill in the of it is again set in motion by british and to the very plains whereon it grew is by the lords of the soil which gave it birth at a cheaper price than that at which their coarser enables them to it the large of the of this country who are engaged in appears from the table deduced from a in an essay on the of wealth by the rev r jones for every hundred persons in there are in bengal in italy in france in england the fact that the of to persons is appears both from the report of the of the house of commons upon july and from the still later of the last census; from which the annexed table of the of in our great towns has been deduced of per cent names of places total glasgow great britain thus in three periods of ten years during each of which the general of the country has about per cent or about per cent upon the whole period of thirty years the of these towns has on the average per cent after this there no further to the vast to the of this country of making the of its well and to the which are derived from and seem to arise from three sources the which they make to human power the economy they produce of human time the of common and into of to human power with respect to the first of these causes the forces derived from wind from water and from steam present to the mind of every one; these are in fact to human power and will be in a future page there are however other sources of its by which the animal force of the is itself made to act with far greater than its power; and to these we shall at present confine our the of palaces of temples and of tombs seems to have the of nations just on the career of and the blocks of stone moved from their native to to the or piety of the have to excite the of their long after the of many of these records as well as the names of their have been the degrees of force to move these masses will have varied to the of the people in their and that the extent of power for this purpose is widely under will appear from the which is related by m sur l'art de batir a block of squared stone was taken for the subject of weight of stone lbs in order to drag this stone along the floor of the quarry roughly it a force equal to lbs the same stone dragged over a floor of planks lbs the same stone placed on a of wood and dragged over a floor of planks lbs after soaping the two of wood which slid over each other it lbs the same stone was now placed upon rollers of three inches when it to put it in motion along the floor of the quarry lbs to drag it by these rollers over a wooden floor lbs when the stone was mounted on a wooden and the same rollers placed between that and a plank floor it lbs from this it results that the force to move a stone along part of its weight the roughly floor of its quarry is nearly along a wooden floor by wood upon wood if the wooden are soaped with rollers on the floor of the quarry on rollers on wood on rollers between wood at each of as well as on the of every new tool human labour becomes the man who rollers a tool by which his power was the workman who first the of soap or grease was enabled to move without a greater effort more than three times the weight he could before the economy of human time is the next of in so and is this effect that we might if we were to embrace almost all the under this single head but the of of less extent will more readily to a of the and as will be to the reader in the ensuing pages we shall our upon this point as an example of the economy of time the use of in rocks may be noticed several pounds of powder may be for a sum by a few days' labour yet when this is for the purpose alluded to effects are which could not even with the best tools be by other means in less than many months the of one of the blocks of from the worked for the of the at were ft long ft wide and ft deep this mass above cubic feet and about tons was blasted three times two charges of lbs each were in a hole feet deep the bore being inches at top and inches at bottom lbs of powder were in the rent formed by those each pound of from the rock two tons of matter or nearly times its own weight the expense of the powder was l or nearly d per lb the boring two men during a day and a half and cost about s; and the value of the produce was at that time about l the simple of tin tubes for through between by which the of the are to the parts of an a economy of time it is in the shops and in london and might with be used in in large houses in orders from the nursery to the kitchen or from the house to the stable its arises not merely from saving the servant or workman useless to receive but from the master himself from that to give trouble which induces him to forego a want when he knows that his must mount several flights of stairs to his wishes and after must mount again to supply them the to which such a mode of can be does not appear to have been and would be an subject for enquiry it to be between london and about minutes would elapse before the words spoken at one end would reach the other of the pipe the art of using the diamond for cutting glass has within a few years a very a when using a diamond set in a conical ferrule as was always the about twenty years since found great in the art of using it with and at the end of a seven years' many were found but skilled in its this arose from the of finding the precise angle at which the diamond cuts and of guiding it along the glass at the proper when that angle is found almost the whole of the time and of the glass in the art of cutting glass may now be saved by the use of an tool the gem is set in a small piece of squared brass with its edges nearly to one side of the square a person skilled in its use now files away the brass on one side until by trial he finds that the diamond will make a clean cut when guided by keeping this edge pressed against a ruler the diamond and its are now to a stick like a pencil by means of a swivel a small angular motion thus even the at once applies the cutting edge at the proper angle by the side of the brass against a ruler; and even though the part he holds in his hand should deviate a little from the angle it no to the of the diamond which rarely fails to do its office when thus the of the diamond in is a fact an workman on whose i can rely me that he has seen a diamond ground with diamond powder on a mill for three hours without its being at all worn but that on its with respect to the surface the same edge was ground away of of little value the skins used by the are from the offal of animals the hoofs of horses and cattle and other horny refuse are in the of the of potash that yellow salt which is in the shops of some of our the wornout and tinware of our when beyond the reach of the art are not utterly we meet carts loaded with old tin kettles and wornout iron our streets these have not yet their useful course; the less parts are cut into strips punched with small holes and with a coarse black varnish for the use of the who the edges and angles of his boxes with them; the are to the in the of the town who employ them in with acid in making a black die for the use of calico of tools the between a tool and a machine is not capable of very precise nor is it in a popular of those terms to limit very their a tool is usually more simple than a it is used with the hand whilst a machine is moved by animal or steam power the simpler are often merely one or more tools placed in a frame and acted on by a moving power in out the of tools we shall with some of the to arrange twenty needles thrown into a box mixed and in every in such a form that they shall be all to each other would at first sight appear a most tedious in fact if each needle were to be many hours must be in the process yet this is an which must be many times in the of and it is in a few minutes by a very simple tool; nothing more being than a small flat tray of sheet iron concave at the bottom in this the needles are placed and shaken in a manner by them up a very little and giving at the same time a slight motion to the tray the shape of the needles assists their for if two needles cross each other unless which is they happen to be they will when they fall on the bottom of the tray tend to place side by side and the hollow form of the tray assists this as they have no in any part to impede this or to each other they are by shaking in three or four minutes the of the shake is now changed the needles are but little thrown up but the tray is shaken the result of which is that in a minute or two the needles which were endways become heaped up in a wall with their ends against the of the tray they are then removed by at a time with a broad iron spatula on which they are by the of the left hand as this of the needles must be many times if a cheap and method had not been devised the expense of the would have been another process in the art of making needles an example of one of the which can come under the of a tool after the needles have been in the manner just it is to them into two parcels in order that their points may be all in one this is usually done by women and the needles are placed in a heap on a table in front of each just as they are by the process above from five to ten are rolled towards this person with the of the left hand; this them a very small space from each other and each in its turn is pushed to the right or to the left to the of the point this is the usual process and in it every needle passes under the finger of the a small the process the child puts on the of its right hand a small cloth cap or and rolling out of the heap from six to twelve needles he keeps them down by the of the left hand whilst he presses the of the right hand gently against their ends those which have the points towards the right hand stick into the and the child the finger of the left hand raises the needles into the cloth and then pushes them towards the left side those needles which had their eyes on the right hand do not stick into the finger cover and are pushed to the heap on the right side before the of this process by means of this simple each of the finger from one side to the other carries five or six needles to their proper heap; whereas in the former method only one was moved and rarely more than two or three were at one to their place various occur in the arts in which the of an hand would be a great to the workman and in these cases tools or of the come to our aid vices of forms in which the to be wrought is firmly grasped by screws are of this kind and are used in almost every but a more example may be found in the trade of the some kinds of nails such as those used for the soles of coarse shoes called require a form of the head which is made by the stroke of a die the workman holds one end of the rod of iron out of which he forms the nails in his left hand; with his right hand he hammers the redhot end of it into a point and cutting the proper length almost off bends it nearly at a right angle he puts this into a hole in a small under a hammer which is with a treadle and has a die sunk in its surface to the form of the head; and having given one part of the form to the head with the small hammer in his hand he moves the treadle with his foot the other hammer and the figure of the head; the stroke by the of the treadle the nail out of the hole in which it was without this of his foot for another hand the workman would be obliged to heat the nails twice over another though a less general of tools for human hands is used to assist the labour of those who are by nature or by of some of their limbs those who have had an of the for the of shoes by which we owe to the fertile of mr brunel must have noticed many in which the workmen were enabled to execute their task with under the of the loss of an arm or leg a

labour under the same natural these of skill and deserve a double portion of our when applied to the of natural or when they supply the rich with and when they relieve the poor from the evils of poverty and want of the objects of there exists a natural in point of number a very unequal amongst they may be classed as; first those which are to produce power and as those which are merely to force and execute work the first of these is of great and is very limited in the variety of its species some of those species consist of of that class of agents by which motion is lever the pulley the wedge and many others it has been that no power is gained by their use however force is applied at one point can only be exerted at some other by and other causes; and it has been further proved that is gained in the of is by the of force these two long since placed beyond the reach of doubt cannot be too borne in mind but in our to things which are we are still as we hope to shew of a field of and of derived from skill which have but just begun to their on our arts and may be pursued without limit to the the wealth and the of our race of those by which we produce power it may be that they are to us immense yet in regard to two of the sources of this force of wind and of waterwe merely make use of bodies in a state of motion by nature; we change the of their in order to render them to our but we neither add to nor the of motion in when we expose the sails of a to the gale we check the of a small portion of the and convert its own motion into one of in the sails; we thus change the

chapter power the work to be done more force for its than can be in the time for its must be had to some method of and a part of the power exerted to the of the process this is most by a which is in fact nothing more than a wheel having a very heavy rim so that the greater part of its weight is near the it great power applied for some time to put this into rapid motion; but when moving with the effects are if its force be upon a small object in some of the iron works where the power of the is a little too small for the rollers which it drives it is usual to set the engine at work a short time before the redhot iron is ready to be removed from the furnace to the rollers and to allow it to work with great until the fly has a rather to those unused to such on passing the mass of iron through the first groove the engine a great and very check; and its speed is at the next and at each passage until the iron bar is reduced to such a size that the power of the engine is to roll it the effect of a large when its force can be on a point was at one of the largest of our the was shewing to a friend the method of holes in iron plates for the boilers of he held in his hand a piece of of an inch thick which he placed under the punch after several holes had been made that the punch made its more and more slowly he called to the to know what made the engine work so when it was found that the and had been from the just at the of his another mode of power arises from lifting a weight and then it to fall a man even with a heavy hammer might strike blows upon the head of a pile without any effect but if he raises a much heavier hammer to a much greater height its fall though far less will produce the desired effect when a small blow is given to a large mass of matter as to a pile the of the causes a small loss of in the of the motion from each to the one; and it may happen that the whole force shall be before it reaches the the power within a small space by is well known; and though not an of the subject in this chapter some of its effects under are so that an attempt to explain them may perhaps be excused if a gun is loaded with ball it will not kick so much as when loaded with small shot; and amongst kinds of shot that which is the causes the recoil against the a gun loaded with a of sand equal in weight to a charge of kicks still more if in loading a space is left between the wadding and the charge the gun either recoils or bursts if the muzzle of a gun has been stuck into the ground so as to be stopped up with clay or even with snow or if it be fired with its muzzle plunged into water the almost certain result is that it bursts the cause of these effects is that every force time to produce its effect; and if the time for the elastic vapour within to force out the sides of the barrel is less than that in which the of the air near the wadding is in force to drive the from the muzzle then the barrel must burst if happens that these two forces are so nearly that the barrel only swells; the giving way before the gun is burst the of this will appear by tracing step by step the which arise on a gun loaded with powder by a piece of wadding and having its muzzle filled with clay or some other having a degree of in this case the first effect of the is to produce an on it and to advance the wadding through a very small space here let us it as at rest for a moment and examine its the portion of air in contact with the wadding is and if the wadding were to remain at rest the air the tube would soon acquire a uniform density but this would require a small of time; for the next the wadding would travel with the of sound to the other end from whence being back a series of waves would be which aided by the of the tube would destroy the motion but until the first wave reaches the at the muzzle the air can exert no against it now if the to the wadding is very much greater than that of sound the of the air in advance of it may be very great before the to the muzzle is at all in which case the mutual of the of air so will offer an barrier to the advance of the wadding if this be correct the recoil when a gun is loaded with small shot or sand may arise in some measure from the of the air between their but chiefly from the by the to those of the in contact with the powder being greater than that with which a wave can be through them it also affords a reason for the success of a method of rocks by filling the upper part of the hole above the powder with sand instead of clay rammed hard that the of the gun barrel does not arise from the by fluids and in some measure also by sand and small shot of equally in all and thus a force against a large portion of the surface seems to be proved by a by le and other that for the purpose of taking birds without their plumage they filled the barrel of their fowling pieces with water instead of loading them with a charge of shot the same a curious which occurs in firing a still more if we put a small of silver upon the face of an anvil and strike it with a hammer it but instead of either the hammer or the anvil it is found that that part of the face of each in contact with the silver is damaged in this case the by the elastic matter may be greater than the of a wave steel; so that the at the surface are driven by the so near to those next that when the force is removed the of the within the mass drives back those nearer to the surface with such force that they pass beyond the limits of and are in the shape of powder i the success of the of firing a tallow candle through a deal board would be in the same manner by the of a wave through deal to be greater than that of a wave passing through tallow ii the boiler of a bursts even during the escape of steam through the if the water in the boiler is thrown upon any part which happens to be red hot the steam formed in the of that part expands with greater than that with which a wave can be through the less heated steam; one is urged against the next and an almost is formed in the same manner as in the case of the of a gun if the is closed it may retain the thus created for a short time and even when it is open the escape may not be rapid to remove all there may exist within the boiler of various force varying from that which can just lift the up to that which is if exerted during an small space of time to tear open the boiler itself this ought however to be with and perhaps some to examine it may be by tracing it to extreme cases it would seem but this is not a that a gun might be made so long that it would burst no filled up its muzzle it should also follow that if after the gun is charged the air were from the barrel though the muzzle be then left closed the gun ought not to burst it would also seem to follow from the of the that a body might be in air or other elastic medium with such force that after a very short space it should return in the same in which it was notes see remarks ecole polytec

art of on the decline of science in england p chapter and of the fatigue on the muscles of the human frame does not depend on the actual force in each effort but partly on the with which it is exerted the to every of two parts one of these is the of force which is to drive the tool or and the other is the effort for the motion of some limb of the animal the action in driving a nail into a piece of wood one of these is lifting the hammer and its head against the nail; the other is raising the arm itself and moving it in order to use the hammer if the weight of the hammer is the former part will cause the portion of the if the hammer is light the of raising the arm will produce the part of the fatigue it does happen that very force if will tire more than more work there is also a degree of beyond which the action of the muscles cannot be pressed the most load for a porter who carries wood up stairs on his has been by m but he found from that a man walking up stairs without any load and raising his burden by means of his own weight in could do as much work in one day as four men in the way with the most load the between the with which men or animals move and the weights they carry is a matter of in affairs it is also of great for the economy of labour to adjust the weight of that part of the body which is moved the weight of the tool it urges and the of of these efforts so as to produce the effect an of the saving of time by making the same motion of the arm execute two instead of one occurs in the simple art of making the tags of these tags are formed out of very thin tinned and were cut out of long strips of that into pieces of such a breadth that when bent round they just the lace two pieces of steel have been fixed to the side of the shears by which each piece of as soon as it is cut is bent into a form the power for this is almost and it is by the same motion of the arm which the cut the work is usually by women and and with the tool more than three times the of tags is in a given time the work is itself light it becomes in order to time to the the fibres of wool by the fingers would be a most tedious in the common the of the foot is but by a very simple that

becomes more in cast into a mass of metal of about a is heated almost to white heat and placed under a heavy hammer moved by water or steam power this is raised by a on a axis; and if the hammer derived its only from the space through which it fell it would require a greater time to give a blow but as it is that the mass of redhot iron should receive as many blows as before it cools the form of the cam or on the axis is such that the hammer instead of being lifted to a small height is thrown up with a jerk and almost the instant after it strikes against a large beam which acts as a spring and drives it down on the iron with such that by these means about double the number of strokes can be made in a given time in the smaller this is carried still further by the tail of the against a small steel anvil it with such that from three to five hundred strokes are made in a minute in the of anchors an art in which a similar is of still greater it has only been applied in the of scythes the length of the blade renders it that the workman should move readily so as to bring every part of it on the anvil in quick this is by placing him in a seat by ropes from the ceiling so that he is enabled with little bodily to vary his by his feet against the block which the anvil or against the floor an of is to render thus a person may skate with great over ice which would not support his weight if he moved over it more slowly this arises from the fact that time is for the of the ice as soon as the weight of the skater begins to act on any point the ice by the water bends slowly under him; but if the is he has passed off from the spot which was loaded before the bending has reached the point which would cause the ice to break an effect not very from this might take place if very great were to boats let us suppose a boat whose bow forms an plane with the bottom at rest in still water if we imagine some very great force to propel this boat the of the plane at the would cause it to rise in the water; and if the force were it might even rise out of the water and advance by a series of leaps like a piece of slate or an oyster shell thrown as a 'duck and drake' if the force were not to pull the boat out of the water but were just enough to bring its bottom to the surface it would be carried along with a kind of gliding motion with great for at every point of its course it would require a certain time before it could sink to its usual draft of water; but before that time had elapsed it would have to another point and have been raised by the of the water on the plane at its the same fact that bodies moving with great have not time to exert the full effect of their weight seems to explain a which appears to be very it happens that when are knocked down by the wheels pass over them with any injury though if the weight of the had rested on their body even for a few seconds it would have crushed them to death if the view above taken is correct the injury in such will chiefly happen to that part of the body which is struck by the wheel an in which is of is in the produce of mines up to the surface the shafts through which the produce is raised are sunk at a very great expense and it is of course to sink as few of them as the matter to be is raised by with and without this many of our mines could not be worked with profit the effect of great in the form of a is shown in the process for making window glass termed which is one of the most in our arts a workman having dipped his iron tube into the glass pot and loaded it with several pounds of the melted metal blows out a large globe which is with his rod by a short thick hollow neck another workman now fixes to the globe to its neck an iron rod the of which has been dipped in the melted glass; and when this is firmly a few drops of water the neck of the globe from the iron tube the rod with the globe to it is now held at the mouth of a glowing furnace and by turning the rod the globe is made to revolve slowly so as to be exposed to the heat the first effect of this is to make the glass upon itself and to enlarge the opening of the neck as the the globe is turned more quickly on its axis and when very soft and almost it is removed from the fire and the of being still the opening from the effect of the force at first until at last the mouth expands or flashes out into one large sheet of red hot glass the neck of the globe which is to become the outer part of the sheet is left thick to admit of this and forms the edge of the plate of glass which is called a table the centre the of a thick boss or called the at the part by which it was to the iron rod the most reason for for arises from the of great with small power systems of pulleys the crane and many other might also be adduced here as but they belong more to some of the other causes which we have for the of the common is an in which the is too great for the purpose and it is through wheels which reduce it to a

useful to woods with resins varnish or oil; and wood with oil might in some be in for giving a but very minute supply of that fluid to iron or steel against which it is worked some idea of the of matter which can be into wood by great may be formed from the fact stated by mr an which to a boat of one of our the harpoon having been struck into the fish the whale in this dived down and carried the boat along with him on to the surface the animal was killed but the boat instead of rising was found beneath the whale by the rope of the and on drawing it up every part of the wood was found to

they are nearly rotten they are still by the thus the of a vast of small columns amongst natural the surface of our globe there are some which it would be to the wearing down of the rocks which impede the rapids of rivers is one of this class a very process for this object has been in america a boat is placed at the bottom of the rapid and kept in its by a long rope which is firmly fixed on the bank of the river near the top an axis having a wheel similar to the of a fixed at each end of it is placed across the boat; so that the two wheels and their axis shall revolve rapidly being driven by the force of the passing current let us now imagine several beams of wood shod with pointed iron fixed at the ends of strong levers beyond the bow of the boat as in the annexed if these levers are at liberty to move up and down and if one or more pieces called cams are fixed on the axis to the end of each lever the action of the stream upon the wheels will keep up a of blows the shoe upon the rock at the bottom will detach small pieces which the stream will carry off thus by the mere action of the river itself a and most system of the rock at its bottom is a single workman may by the aid of a rudder direct the boat to any part of the stream; and when it is to move up the rapid as the channel is cut he can easily cause the boat to advance by means of a capstan when the object of the just has been and the channel is deep a slight the to another purpose almost equally the and the pieces on the axis are removed and a barrel of wood or metal part of the axis and capable at of being with or from the axis itself is the rope which the boat is now fixed to this barrel; and if the barrel is loose upon the axis the makes the axis only revolve and the boat remains in its place but the moment the axis is to its barrel this begins to turn and winding up the rope the boat is drawn up against the stream; and may be as a kind of tugboat for vessels which have to ascend the rapid when the tugboat reaches the summit the barrel is from the axis and being applied to its the boat is allowed to descend clocks occupy a very high place amongst by means of which human time is and their in

must prove the is not too little this would soon have been from the of the public and the and that it is not too great this latter point was by an a few hours after one side of a sheet of paper has been printed upon the ink is dry to allow it to receive the upon the other; and as is made use of the tympan on which the side first printed is laid is guarded from soiling it by a sheet of paper

the and no can arise from the or of the the steel punch with which the for a is cut if it once perform its office with the same exact circle the with which its work is perhaps one of its most it may however be that a portion of this may be into saving of time; for it happens that any in tools the of work done in a given time without tools that is by the mere efforts of the human hand there are of things which it would be to make add to the human hand the rudest cutting and its powers are the of many things then becomes easy and that of others with great labour add the saw to the knife or the

the aid of the lathe and the is the of of workmen of all the of art that of turning is the most perfect if two are worked against each other may have been their figure at the there exists a in them

turning there is a in these two bodies so to become conical or to have if a piece of iron be worked round in a hole the edges will wear and it will become conical these facts if they do not explain at least the on which the of work formed in the lathe depends chapter of copying the two sources of in the work by depend on a which a very large portion of all and is one upon which the of the seems greatly to depend the alluded to is that of copying taken in its most sense almost pains are in some on the from which a series of copies is to be and the larger the number of these copies the more care and pains can the afford to lavish upon the it may thus happen that the or tool the work shall cost five or even ten times the price of each of its power as the system of copying is of so much and of such use in the arts it will be to a number of those in which it is the however is not offered as a list; and the are to the detail which is with a due regard to making the subject of copying are under the by from by by from surface by by casting with by with altered of from the art of in all its is an art of copying under its two great from hollow lines as in and from surface as in block are arts in this the copies are made by to paper by means of a thick ink from the hollows and lines cut in the copper an artist will exhaust the labour of one or two years upon a plate which will not in some cases furnish above five hundred copies in a state of on steel this art is like that of on copper except that the number of copies is far less limited a as a will not give above three without a two of a on steel were by one of our most eminent artists who found it to with any which was the one of these was a proof from amongst the first the other was taken after between seventy and eighty had been printed off music music is usually printed from pewter plates on which the have been by steel punches the metal being much softer than copper is liable to which detain a small portion of the ink this is the reason of the dirty of printed music a new process has been by mr cowper by which this will be avoided the method which give to the is still an art of but it is by surface nearly in the same manner as from blocks to be the method of music from pewter plates by far the most made use of is not the only one for music is printed from stone also it is printed with type; and the musical are printed on the paper and the lines printed of both these latter modes of may be seen in the of from the types of the press of bodoni at parma but the great care on the of that work the of in the lines arising from the use of types when the and lines are printed at the same time is calico from many of the on printed calicos are copies by from copper about four or five inches in on which the desired pattern has been one portion of the is exposed to the ink whilst an elastic scraper of very thin steel by being pressed against another part removes all ink from the surface to its the cloth a piece of calico yards in length rolls through this press and is printed in four or five minutes from sheets of metal or very thin brass is in the form of letters usually those of a name; this is placed on any which it is to mark and a brush dipped in some paint is passed over the brass those parts which are cut away admit the paint and thus a copy of the name appears on the below this method which affords rather a coarse copy is used for paper with which rooms are covered and more for the borders if a portion be to match an old pattern this is perhaps the most way of it of leaves upon paper may be made by a kind of surface such leaves are chosen as have the parts of these are covered by means of an inking ball with a mixture of some pigment ground up in linseed oil; the leaf is then placed between two sheets of paper and being gently pressed the from the parts on each side appear on the sheets of paper the red cotton dyed at glasgow have their pattern given to them by a process similar to except that instead of from a pattern the reverse that of a part of the colour from a cloth already dyedis a number of are pressed with very great force between two plates of metal which are with round or holes to the pattern the upper plate of metal is by a rim and a fluid which has the of the red dye is poured upon that plate this liquid passes through the holes in the metal and also through the calico; but owing to the great all the parts of the plates not cut away it does not spread itself beyond the pattern after this the are washed and the pattern of each is a copy of the in the used in the process another mode by which a pattern is formed by colour from a dyed cloth is to print on it a pattern with paste; then passing it into the it comes out dyed of one uniform colour but the paste has the fibres of the cotton from the action of the dye or and when the cloth so dyed is well washed the paste is and leaves all those parts of the cloth to which it was applied from surface this second of is of more in the arts than that which has just been from wooden blocks a block of box wood is in this the out of which the pattern is formed the design being upon it the workman cuts away with sharp tools every part except the lines to be in the this is exactly the reverse of the process of on copper in which every line to be is cut away the ink instead of filling the cut in the wood is spread upon the surface which remains and is thence to the paper from types this is the most in its of all the arts of copying it a in the immense of the parts that form the pattern after that pattern has of copies the same may be again and again in other forms and thus supply of from each of which of their copied may flow it also this that may be used along with the and taken from both at the same from this mode of copies is very similar to the there are two modes by which plates are in that most adopted a mould is taken in plaster from the types and in this the plate is cast another method has been in france instead of the work in type it was set up in copper each matrix being in fact a piece of copper of the same size as the type and having the of the letter sunk into its surface instead of in relief a plate may it is evident be at once from this of the to the plan is the great expense of keeping so large a of as the does not readily admit of change plates can only be applied with to cases where an number of copies are or where the work of figures and it is of great to ensure may however be made in it from time to time; and thus tables may by the gradual of error at last become perfect this mode of copies in common with that by types the of the use of the copy of the woodcut in the plate being equally perfect with that of the type this union is of and cannot be with on copper books the gilt letters on the backs of books are formed by placing a piece of gold leaf upon the leather and upon it brass letters heated these cause the gold under them to adhere to the leather whilst the rest of the metal is easily brushed away when a great number of copies of the same volume are to be it is found to be cheaper to have a brass pattern cut with the whole of the proper title this is placed in a press and being kept hot the covers each having a small bit of placed in the proper are brought under the brass and stamped the at the back of the volume in the hand was in this manner calico from blocks this is a mode of copying by surface from the ends of small pieces of copper wire of various forms fixed into a block of wood they are all of one uniform height about the eighth part of an inch above the surface of the wood and are by the maker into any pattern if the block be placed upon a piece of fine woollen cloth on which ink of any colour has been spread the copper wires receive a portion which they give up when applied to the calico to be printed by the former method of on calico only one colour could be used; but by this plan after the flower of a rose for example has been printed with one set of blocks the leaves may be printed of another colour by a set after the canvas which forms the basis of has been covered with paint of one uniform tint the of the which it passes through are a series of by surface from formed upon wooden blocks very similar to those by the calico printer each colour a set of blocks those with the variety of colours are most there are several other of which we shall briefly notice as arts of which not surface yet are more allied to it than that from letter copying in one of the modes of this process a sheet of very thin paper is damped and placed upon the writing to be copied the two papers are then passed through a rolling press and a portion of the ink from one paper is to the other the writing is of course by this but the paper to which it is being thin the are seen through it on the other side in their proper another common mode of copying letters is by placing a sheet of paper covered on both sides with a from between a sheet of thin paper and the paper on which the letter to be is to be written if the upper or thin sheet be written upon with any hard pointed the word written with this style will be from the black paper upon both those it the of the upper sheet which is by the writer is in this to render legible the writing which is on the back of the paper both these arts are very limited in their extent the former two or three the latter from two to perhaps ten or fifteen copies at the same time on china this is an art of copying which is carried to a very great extent as the to which the is to be are often curved and even fluted the ink or paint is first from the copper to some such as paper or an elastic of glue and treacle it is almost from this to the unbaked biscuit to which it more readily adheres this is another mode of copies in almost number the which the copies is a drawing made on a stone of a porous nature the ink for tracing it is made of such greasy that when water is poured over the stone it shall not wet the lines of the drawing when a roller covered with ink which is of an oily nature is passed over the stone wetted the water this ink from to the whilst the ink used in the drawing is of such a nature that the ink adheres to it in this state if a sheet of paper be placed upon the stone and then passed under a press the ink will be to the paper leaving the ink used in the drawing still to the stone there is one of which does not appear to have and perhaps further are to bring it to it is the of works which have just arrived from other a few years ago one of the paris was at as soon as it arrived by means of whilst the ink is yet fresh this may easily be it is only to place one copy of the on a stone; and by means of great applied to it in a rolling press a of the ink will be to the stone by similar means the other side of the may be copied on another stone and these stones will then furnish in the usual way if from stone could be reduced to the same price per as that from types this process might be adopted with great for the supply of works for the use of distant the same for a single copy might be printed off with ink and thus an english work for example might be in america from stone whilst the printed from types made its on the same day in england it is much to be wished that such a method were to the of of old and scarce books this however would require the of two copies since a leaf must be for each page such a method of a small of an old work is to tables the setting up of which in type is always and liable to error but how long ink will to be to stone from paper on which it has been printed must be by the of the greasy or oily portion of the ink in the of old books seems to present the if one only of the ink were removed by time it might perhaps be hoped that means would be for it but if this be an attempt might be made to some having a strong for the carbon of the ink which remains on the paper and very little for the paper itself prints have been in colours in such a stone seems to have been for each colour and care or very good must have been to adjust the paper to each stone if any two kinds of ink should be one stone might be for two inks; or if the for the second and colours had cut away to those parts of the stone inked by the ones then several colours might be printed from the same stone but these do not appear to promise much except for coarse it is thought to print from a wooden block or plate the same pattern upon the side of the paper the effect of this which is called is to make it appear as if the ink had through the paper and the pattern visible on the other side if the subject chosen many fine lines it seems at first sight to effect so exact a super of the two on sides of the same piece of paper that it shall be to detect the yet the process is simple the block which gives the is always brought down to the same place by means of a hinge; this spot is covered by a piece of thin leather over it; the block is now inked and being brought down to its place gives an of the pattern to the leather it is then turned back; and being inked a second time the paper to be printed is placed upon the leather when the block again the upper surface of the paper is printed from the block and its takes up the from the leather it is evident that the of this mode of depends in a great measure on finding some soft like leather which will take as much ink as it ought from the block and which will give it up most to paper thus are usually fainter on the lower side; and in order in some measure to remedy this defect rather more ink is put on the block at the first than at the second of copying by casting the art of casting by pouring in a fluid state into a mould which retains them until they become solid is an art of the form of the thing upon that of the pattern from which it was formed of casting iron and other of wood or metal made from are the from which the moulds for casting are made so that in fact the casting itself is a copy of the mould; and the mould is a copy of the pattern in of iron and metals for the coarser and if they are to be worked even for the finer the exact amongst the things which takes place in many of the arts to which we have alluded is not in the first nor is this as the metals shrink in cooling the pattern is made larger than the copy; and in it from the sand in which it is moulded some little will occur in the size of the cavity which it leaves in smaller works where is more and where few or no after are to be a mould of metal is which has been formed with care thus in casting bullets which ought to be and smooth an iron is used in which a cavity has been cut and ground; and in order to obviate the in cooling a jet is left which may supply the of metal arising from that cause and which is cut off the leaden toys for are cast in brass moulds which open and in which have been graved or the figures to be a very mode of small of the most in bronze has been by mr a small strip of a firtree a branch of holly a curled leaf of or any other is by one end in a small of paper which is placed for support within a formed tin case the finest river silt from all the coarser and mixed with water so as to have the of cream is poured into the paper by small at a time shaking the plant a little after each in order that its leaves may be covered and that no bubbles of air may be left the plant and its mould are now allowed to dry and the nature of the paper allows the loamy coating to shrink from the outside when this is dry it is by a coarser and finally we have the twig with all its leaves in a perfect mould this mould is dried and then heated to a red heat at the ends of some of the leaves or shoots wires have been left to afford by their removal and in this state of strong a stream of air is into the hole formed by the end of the branch the is that the wood and leaves which had been turned into by the fire are now into acid by the current of air; and after some time the whole of the solid matter of which the plant is removed leaving a hollow mould bearing on its all the traces of its late when this process is the mould being still kept at nearly a red heat the fluid metal which by its weight either drives the very small of air which at that high remains behind out through the or it into the pores of very porous of which the mould is formed when the form of the object to be cast is such that the pattern cannot be from its mould of sand or plaster it becomes to make the pattern with wax or some other easily fusible the sand or plaster is moulded round this pattern and by the of heat the wax is through an opening left for its escape it is often to the form of the by animals such as those of spiral shells and of the various corals this may be by filling them with fusible metal and the of the shell by acid; thus a solid will remain which exactly filled all the if such forms are in silver or any other fusible metal the shells may be filled with wax or resin then away; and the waxen form may serve as the pattern from which a plaster mould may be made for casting the metal some nicety will be in these and perhaps the minuter can only be filled under an casting in plaster this is a mode of copying applied to a variety of to produce of the human formof of rare which latter purpose it has lately been applied with great in all casting the first process is to make the mould; and plaster is the which is almost always for the purpose the which it of for a short time in a state of renders it adapted to this object and even to an of plaster is by oiling the surface on which it is poured the mould formed round the subject which is copied removed in pieces and then is that in which the copy is cast this process gives utility and value to the finest works of art the of the academy at venice are thus enabled to admire the figures of egina in the gallery at munich; as well as the marbles of the the pride of our own museum casts in plaster of the elgin marbles adorn many of the of the and the liberal of such affords us an and source of casting in wax this mode of copying aided by proper offers the most of many objects of natural history and gives an air of reality to them which might deceive even the most figures of persons having the face and hands

the art of by wax does not usually afford the of copies which flow from many similar this number is checked by the stages of the process which ceasing to have the of copying by a tool or pattern

then throws the clay into it with some force; at the same time rapidly working it with his fingers so as to make it close up to the corners he next scrapes off with a wetted stick the clay and shakes the brick out of its mould upon a piece of board on which it is removed by another workman to the place for drying it a very skilful moulder has in a long day from ten to eleven bricks; but a fair

easy and cheap when made by the soft out of which they are formed into a hard mould the care and skill on the of that mould are repaid by the it in many of the works of the china one part only of the article is the upper surface of the plate for example whilst the under side is figured by the lathe in some the handle or only a few are moulded and the body of the work is turned glass seals the process of upon gems time and skill the seals thus can never become common however have been made of various degrees of the colour which is given to glass is perhaps the most part of the a small rod of glass is heated in the flame of a until the becomes soft the then pinches it between the ends of a pair of nippers which are formed of brass and on one side of which the device for the seal has been carved in relief when the mould has been well and care is taken in heating the glass the seals thus are not bad and by this system of copying they are so that the more kinds are sold at for three pence a dozen square glass bottles the round forms which are usually given to vessels of glass are readily by the of the air with which they are blown it is however in many cases to make bottles of a square form and each capable of holding exactly the same of fluid it is also to have on them the name of the maker of the or other liquid they are to contain a mould of iron or of copper is of the size on the inside of which are the names this mould which is used in a hot state opens into two parts to allow the of the round bottle which is placed in it in a very soft state before it is removed from the end of the iron tube with which it was blown the mould is now closed and the glass is forced against its sides by blowing into the bottle wooden snuff boxes snuff boxes with devices in of carved work or of rose engine turning are sold at a price which proves that they are only the wood or horn out of which they are formed is by long boiling in water and whilst in this state it is forced into moulds of iron or steel on which are cut the where it remains exposed to great until it is dry horn knife handles and handles the which horn of soft by the action of water and of heat fits it for many useful it is pressed into moulds and becomes with figures in relief adapted to the objects to which it is to be applied if curved it may be or if it may be bent into any forms which or utility may and by the use of the mould these forms may be in endless variety the sorts of knives the crooked handles for and a of other to which horn is applied attest the which the art of copying gives to the things formed of this the same is applied to things formed out of the shell of the turtle or the land from the greatly price of the raw this of copying is however more rarely upon it; and the few which are are usually by hand making this simple art is almost one of copying the moulds are formed of iron in two parts each one half of the stem; the line of of these parts may be running from one end of the pipe to the other the hole passing to the bowl is formed by a long wire through the clay before it is in the mould some of the moulds have figures or names sunk in the inside which give a figure in relief upon the pipe upon calico of one colour but all over with raised though not much worn in this country are in great demand in several foreign markets this is by passing them between rollers on one of which is figured in the pattern to be to the calico the of the cloth is pressed very into the thus formed and retains its pattern after use the watered in the cover of the volume in the hands is in a similar manner a of on which the design of the is cut is pressed by screws against another formed out of pieces of brown paper which have been and turned the two are made to revolve rapidly the paper one being damped and after a few minutes it takes an from the upper or metal one the glazed calico is now passed between the rollers its glossy surface being in contact with the metal which is kept hot by a heated iron within it are watered by placing two pieces on each other in such a that the threads of the one are at right angles to those of the other and them in this state between flat rollers the threads of the one piece produce in those of the other but they are not so deep as when by the former method upon leather this art of copying from on steel rollers is in most similar to the the leather is forced into the and the parts which are not to any cavity are between the rollers swaging this is an art of copying by the smith in order to fashion his iron and steel into the various forms by his he has small blocks of steel into which are sunk of shapes; these are called swages and are in pairs thus if he wants a round bolt in a head of larger and having one or more rims he uses a swaging tool; and having heated the end of his iron rod and it by the end in the of the axis which is called he places its head upon one part of the lage; and whilst an holds the other part on the top of the hot iron he strikes it several times with his hammer turning the head one quarter round the heated iron is thus forced by the blows to assume the form of the mould into which it is by this is one of the most of the art of copying carried to an almost extent; and the with which it can be and the with which the finest traces of the graving tool can be from steel to copper or even from hard steel to soft steel is most we are to mr perkins for most of the which have brought this art at once almost to an is first made upon soft steel which is by a process without in the least its a of soft steel pressed with great force against the steel is now made to roll very slowly and forward over it thus the design but in relief the is in its turn without injury and if it be slowly rolled to and fro with strong on plates of copper it will imprint on a of them a perfect of the steel from which it was made thus the number of copies from the same design may be a but even this is very far short of the limits to which the process may be the steel roller bearing the design upon it in relief may be to make a few of its first upon plates of soft steel and these being become the of the and may in their turn be made the parents of other rollers each like their the extent to which of one may thus be almost the and appears to be for all this art was first by mr perkins for the purpose of the forgery of bank notes a matter of great and there are two which adapt it to that object first the perfect of all the so that any in the line would at once cause that the plates may be formed by the united labours of several artists most eminent in their for as only one of each design is the expense even of the most will be with the of copies from it it must however be that the of copying itself an for any or printed pattern however and thus a which none of the schemes devised for the of forgery appear to have yet in to imitate the most perfect the first process would be to place it with the printed side upon a stone or other on which by passing it through a it might be firmly fixed the next object would be to some solvent which should the paper but neither affect the nor injure the stone or to which it is water does not seem to do this and perhaps weak or acid would be tried if however this could be fully and if the stone or other used to retain the had those which enable us to print from it of the note might be made and the would be biscuit which has been used with a black lead pencil for books seems in some measure adapted for such trials since its may be to any extent by the of the glazing gold and silver many of the used by consist of thin slips of metal which have their form by passing between steel rollers on which the pattern is or thus taking a of copies of the devices papers sheets of paper or covered with gold or silver leaf and with various are used for books and for many the figures upon these are by the same process that of passing the sheets of paper between rollers of copying by this mode of copying is in the arts it is by means of large presses worked with a screw and heavy the on which the copies are are most metals and the process is when they are hot and in one case when the metal is in a state between and coins and medals the whole of the coins which as money are by this mode of copying the screw presses are either worked by manual labour by water or by steam power the mint which was sent a few years since to was capable of coining pieces a day medals which usually have their figures in higher relief than coins are by similar means; but a single blow is rarely to bring them to and the of the metal which arises from the first blow renders it too hard to receive many blows without injury to the die it is after being struck removed to a furnace in which it is heated redhot and after which it is again placed between the dies and blows for medals on which the figures are very these must be many times one of the largest medals struck them nearly a hundred times before it was for and these are usually of brass and are stamped up out of solid or sheet brass by placing it between dies and a heavy weight to drop upon the upper die from a height of from five to fifteen feet buttons and nail heads buttons with crests or other devices are by the same means; and some of those which are plain receive their form from the dies in which they are struck the heads of several kinds of nails which are of spheres or are also formed by these means of a process for copying called in france clichee this curious method of copying by is applied to medals and in some cases to forming plates there exists a range of to the melting point of several of the alloys of lead tin and in which the is neither solid nor yet fluid in this kind of pasty state it is placed in a box under a die which upon it with force the blow drives the metal into the finest lines of the die and the of the latter the whole mass a of the metal is in all by the blow and is by the sides of the box in which the process is carried on the work thus is for its but has not the form of a piece just leaving the the sides are ragged and it must be trimmed and its in the lathe of copying by this mode of copying in driving a steel punch through the to be cut either by a blow or by in some cases the object is to copy the and the from the plate is in other cases the small pieces cut out are the objects of the labour iron plate for boilers the steel punch used for this purpose is from to of an inch in and drives out a disk from a plate of iron from to five eighths of an inch thick tinned iron the of open work which the tinned and wares in general use are rarely punched by the workman who makes them in london the art of out these in is carried on as a trade; and large of sheet tin are thus for borders of waiters and other similar the and the to which the art has been carried are sheets of copper too are punched with small holes about the of an inch in in such that more of the sheet metal is removed than remains behind; and plates of tin have been with above three holes in each square inch the inlaid plates of brass and called buhl work which our are in some formed by but in this case both the parts cut out and those which remain are in many cases in the of the art of copying by the part made use of is that which is punched out cards for guns the of a disk of thin card instead of paper for in its place the charge of a is with it would however be of little avail unless an easy method was of an number of cards each exactly fitting the bore of the barrel the small steel tool used for this purpose cuts out circles similar to its cutting end each of which fills the barrel for which it was of gilt paper the golden stars leaves and other devices sold in shops for the purpose of made of paper and and other fancy works are cut by punches of various forms out of sheets of gilt paper steel chains the chain used in the and fusee in watches and clocks is of small pieces of sheet steel and it is of great that each of these pieces should be of exactly the same size the links are of two sorts; one of them of a single oblong piece of steel with two holes in it and the other formed by two of the same pieces of steel placed to each other and at a small apart by two rivets the two kinds of links occur in the chain each end of the single pieces being placed between the ends of two others and with them by a rivet passing through all three if the rivet holes in the pieces for the double links are not at equal the chain will not be and will be unfit for its purpose copying with in this species of copying there exists but little between the copy and the it is the only of the thing which is similar to the tool through which it passes when the to be upon are hard they must pass in through several holes and it is in some cases to anneal them at wire drawing the metal to be into wire is made of a form and drawn through holes in plates of steel at each passage it becomes smaller and when its section at any point is a precise copy of the last hole through which it passed upon the larger kinds of wire fine lines may be traced running these arise from slight in the holes of the for many of the arts wire the section of which is square or half round is the same method of making it is pursued except that the holes through which it is drawn are in such cases square or or of other form the wire is to be a species of wire is made the section of which a star with from six to twelve rays; this is called pinion wire and is used by the they file away all the rays from a short piece except from about half an inch near one end this becomes a pinion for a clock; and the leaves or teeth are already and from having passed through the tube drawing the art of forming tubes of uniform is nearly similar in its mode of to wire drawing the sheet brass is bent round and so as to form a hollow and if the outside is that which is to be uniform it is drawn through a of holes as in wire drawing if the inside is to be uniform a of steel called are drawn through the brass tube in making tubes for it is that both the inside and outside should be uniform a steel triblet is first passed into the tube which is then drawn through a of holes until the outside is reduced to the size the metal of which the tube is formed is between these holes and the steel within; and when the latter is the surface appears the brass tube is by this process even to double its first length leaden pipes leaden pipes for the of water were made by but it has been found that they can be made both cheaper and better by drawing them through holes in the manner last a of lead of five or six inches in and about two feet long is cast with a small hole through its axis and an iron triblet of about fifteen feet in length is forced into the hole it is then drawn through a series of holes until the lead is upon the triblet from one end to the other and is of the proper in to the size of the pipe iron rolling when of iron of greater than wire are they are formed by passing wrought iron between rollers each of which has sunk in it a groove; and as such rollers rarely touch a line will usually be in the so bar iron is thus shaped into all the various forms of round square oval etc in which it occurs in a species of is thus made which in its section that part of the frame of a window which two panes of glass being much than wood it can be reduced in and offers less to the light; it is much used for it

rollers deeper at those parts where is so that the hollow which the roller would if it could be unwound be a mould of the shape the iron is to fit the various forms into which this paste is made are

forming of various of copying with altered of the this mode of copying is chiefly used for or maps the is simple; and usually in is capable of the size of the copy an figure in london a short time

hand of the over the outline of the head causes the figure to trace a profile by turning the art of turning might perhaps itself be classed amongst the arts of copying a steel axis called a mandril having a pulley to the middle of it is at one end either by a conical point or by a collar and at the other end by another collar through which it passes the which beyond this last collar is formed into a screw by which various called chucks can be to it these chucks are to hold the various to be to the of turning and have a great variety of forms the mandril with the chuck is made to revolve by a strap which passes over the pulley that is to it and over a larger wheel moved either by the foot or by its with steam or water power all work which is on a mandril in some measure of the in the form of that and the perfect of section which ought to exist in every part of the work can only be ensured by an equal in the mandril and its collar rose engine turning this elegant art depends in a great measure on copying plates of metal called having various on the and edges are fixed on the mandril which admits of a either endwise or a fixed called the 'touch' against which the are pressed by a spring obliges the mandril to follow their and thus causes the cutting tool to trace out the same pattern on the work the of the cutting tool from the centre being usually less than the radius of the rosette causes the copy to be much copying dies a lathe has been long known in france and been used at the english mint for copying dies a blunt point is carried by a very slow spiral over every part of the die to be copied and is pressed by a weight into all the while a cutting point with it by the machine the face of a piece of soft steel in which it cuts the device of the die on the same or on a scale the degree of of the copy in as it is smaller than the the die of a will furnish by copy a very die for a but the chief use to be from this lathe is to prepare all the coarser parts and leave only the finer and more lines for the skill and genius of the artist making engine an not very unlike in was for the purpose of making shoe lasts a pattern last of a shoe for the right foot was placed in one part of the and when the machine was moved two pieces of wood placed in another part which had been by screws were cut into lasts greater or less than the as was and the pattern was for the right foot one of the lasts was for the left an effect which was by merely a wheel which the motion between the two pieces of wood to be cut into lasts engine for copying busts many years since the late mr watt amused himself with an engine to produce copies of busts or statues either of the same size as the or in a the on which he were various and some of the results were shewn to his friends but the by which they were made has never been more mr hawkins who nearly at the same time had also a similar machine has placed it in the hands of an artist who has made copies in ivory from a variety of busts the art of in sizes the figures of the aided by that of their cheap through the art of casting to give value to his and to diffuse more widely the arising from their screw cutting when this is in the lathe by means of a screw upon the mandril it is an art of copying but it is only the number of threads in a given length which is copied; the form of the thread and length as well as the of the screw to be cut are of those from which the copy is made there is another method of cutting screws in a lathe by means of one pattern screw which being by wheels with the mandril guides the cutting point in this process unless the time of of the mandril is the same as that of the screw which guides the cutting point the number of threads in a given length will be if the mandril move quicker than the cutting point the screw which is will be finer than the if it move slower the copy will be more coarse than the the screw thus may be finer or coarser it may be larger or smaller in may have the same or a greater number of threads than that from which it is copied; yet all the defects which exist in the will be under the to every from it from copper plates with altered some very of an art of copying not yet made public were brought from paris a few years since a in that city of the name of gonord had a method by which he could take from the same of sizes either larger or smaller than the design having four of a parrot by a circle in this manner i shewed them to the late mr lowry an equally for his skill and for the many with which he his art the of the several were so that the largest was nearly three times the linear size of the and mr lowry assured me that he was unable to detect any lines in one which had not lines in the others there to be a in the of ink but none in the traces of the and from the general it was that the largest but one was the from the the means by which this was have not been but two were formed at the time which merit notice it was that the artist was in of some method of the ink from the lines of a to the surface of some fluid and of the from the fluid to paper if this could be the print would in the first be of exactly the same size as the copper from which it was but if the fluid were in a vessel having the form of an cone with a small at the bottom the liquid might be lowered or raised in the vessel by gradual or through the apex of the cone; in this case the surface to which the adhered would or enlarge and in this altered state the might be to paper it must be that this is liable to very for the of taking an from a liquid surface has a in the art of paper the of the ink from the copper to the fluid to be proved another and more is founded on the elastic nature of the of glue and treacle a already in use in to it is that an from the is taken upon a large sheet of this that this sheet is then in both and that the ink thus is to paper if the copy is to be smaller than the the elastic must first be and then receive the from the on the tension it will and thus reduce the size of the design it is that one may not in all cases as the of the of glue and treacle is still limited perhaps sheets of india rubber of uniform texture and may be found to answer better than this or the ink might be from the copper plate to the surface of a bottle of this gum which bottle might after being by forcing air into it give up the to paper as it would require time to produce in this manner and there might arise some in making them all of the same size the process might be more certain and by that part of the which depends on the or of the design only once; and instead of from the soft the design from it to stone thus a portion of the work would be reduced to an art already well known that of this idea some from the fact that in another set of of a map of st of several sizes a very short line an defect occurs in all the of one size but not in any of a size machine to produce from medals an was a long time ago and is in the manuel de by which are from medals and other objects in relief the medal and the copper are fixed on two sliding plates at right angles to each other so that when the plate on which the medal is fixed is raised by a screw the slide holding the is by an equal in the the medal is fixed on the slide with its face towards the and a little above it a bar at one end in a tracing point and at the other in a short arm at right angles to the bar and holding a diamond point is placed above the copper; so that the tracing point shall touch the medal to which the bar is and the diamond point shall touch the to which the arm is under this the bar being to move to itself and to the copper if the tracing point pass over a flat part of the medal the diamond point will draw a line of equal length upon the copper; but if the tracing point pass over any part of the medal the from the line by the diamond point will be exactly equal to the of the point of the medal above the rest of the surface thus by the transit of this tracing point over any line upon the medal the diamond will draw upon the copper a section of the medal through that line a screw is to the so that if the medal be raised a very small by the screw the will be by the same and thus a new line of section may be drawn and by this process the series of lines on the copper the of the medal on a plane the outline and the form of the figure arising from the of the lines and from their greater or less the effect of this kind of is very and in some gives a high degree of relief it has been on plate glass and is then curious from the of the fine lines traced by the diamond being except in certain lights from this it will have been seen that the on copper must be that is to say that the on the copper cannot be the same as that which arises from a of each point of the medal upon a plane to itself the of the parts will be more altered than that of the less and the greater the relief of the medal the more will be its mr john bate son of mr bate of the poultry has an machine for which he has taken a patent in which this source of is the head in the title page of the present volume is copied from a medal of roger bacon which forms one of a series of medals of eminent men struck at the royal mint at munich and is the first of the of this new art the which arises from too high a relief in the medal or in the bust might be by some by which the of the diamond point from the right line which it would when the tracing point a plane would be made not to the of the point above the plane of the medal but to its above some other plane removed to a fit behind it thus busts and statues might be reduced to any degree of relief the machine just other views which seem to deserve some and perhaps some if a medal were placed under the tracing point of a an tool for the pencil and a in the place of the paper; and if by some the tracing point which slides in a plane could as it is carried over the of the medal or the depth of the line to the actual height of the point on the medal then an would be free at least from any it might be liable to of a kind if by any similar instead of lines we could make on each point of the copper a dot varying in size or depth with the of the point of the medal above its plane than a new species of would be and the variety of these might again be by causing the graving point to very small circles of varying with the height of the point on the medal above a given plane; or by making the graving tool consist of three points whose or to some law on the of the point above the plane of the medal it would perhaps be to imagine the effects of some of these kinds of but they would all possess in common the of being by lines of the objects and the of the shade of the ink would either vary to some of the of the point from some given plane or it would be a little by the from the same plane of a few of the points the system of shading maps by means of lines of equal above the sea bears some analogy to this mode of medals and if applied to them would produce a species of the on the plane of the medal of the section of an plane placed at above it with the medal itself would produce a of the figure on the medal in which all the parts of it would be dark in to their other species of might be by instead of the plane an sphere or other solid the figure in

measure secure him from the of fashion whilst it a far greater amount of profit the of each is the of data for the purpose of the to how many he will acquire by a given in the price of the article he

as to yield a of profit to assist in forming a table of the numbers of persons who possess incomes of amount occur in the th report of the of revenue inquiry which a of the amount of proved at the legacy office during one year; the number of the various classes of and an account of the number of persons from funded into classes such a table formed even and in the form of a curve might be of service a exists between the terms making and the former refers to the of a small the latter to that of a very large number of and the is well in the given before the of the house of commons on the export of tools and on that mr stated that he had been applied to by the navy board to make iron tanks for ships and that he was rather to do so as he it to be out of his line of however he to make one as a trial the holes for the rivets were punched by with presses and the holes which each tank cost seven the navy board who a large number that he should supply forty tanks a week for many months the of the order made it worth his while to and to make tools for the express mr offered if the board would give him an order for two tanks to supply them at the rate of eighty per week the order was given he made tools by which the expense of the of each tank was reduced from seven to he tanks a week for six months and the price charged for each was reduced from pounds to fifteen if the maker of an article wish to become a in the more sense of the term he must attend to other besides those ones on which the of his work and he must arrange the whole system of his factory in such a manner that the article he sells to the public may be at as small a cost as should he not be at first by motives so remote he will in every highly country be by the of to attend to the of the economy of at every in price of the he makes he will be driven to seek in a saving of expense in some of the and his will be in this enquiry by the hope of being able in his turn to his rivals the benefit of the thus is for a short time to those from whose they derive their origin; but when a has proved their value they become adopted until in their turn they are by other more methods chapter of money as a medium of in the earlier stages of the of the few was by barter but as soon as their wants became more varied and the of having some common measure of the value of all itself capable of thus money was in some shells have been for this but nations have by common consent adopted the metals the power has in most assumed the right of or in other words the right of with marks pieces of metal having certain forms and weights and a certain degree of the marks a to the people amongst whom the money that each piece is of the weight and quality the expense of gold into coin and that of the loss arising from wear as well as of on the capital in it must either be by the state or be by a small in its weight and is a far less cost to the nation than the loss of time and which would arise from a system of or barter these coins are liable to two they may be by of the same quality and or may be made of metal or of weight the first of these would be easily by making the current value of the coin nearly equal to that of the same weight of the metal; and the second would be by the caution of in the of each coin and partly by the by the state on the of such frauds the of money vary in and much time may be lost by an system of the effect is felt in keeping and in the on loans or the upon bills of the decimal system is the best adapted to all such and it becomes an to whether our own might not be into one divided the great step that of the guinea has already been taken without any and but little is now to render the change if it becomes to call in the a new coin of the value of two were issued which should be called by some name a unit a prince for we should have the tenth part of a a few years after when the public were with this coin it might be divided into one hundred instead of and it would then consist of pence each of which would be four per cent less in value than the former penny the and being then from their place might be with silver coins each worth five of the new pence and by others of and of the latter coin having a name would be the tenth part of a prince the various and the various by the of a country all become by the thus but it must be that the value of gold is itself and that like all other its price depends on the extent of the demand with that of the supply as and the sums to be paid become large the actual of the metals from one to another is with and and it is found more to written to pay on demand of gold these are called and when the person or body issuing them is known to be able to fulfil the pledge the note will for a long time before it gets into the hands of any person who may wish to make use of the gold it these paper supply the place of a certain of gold; and being much cheaper a large portion of the expense of a is saved by their as the of is to a extent by shorter banks are into which all monies are paid and out of which all are made through written orders called checks drawn by those who keep with them in a large capital each bank through its checks payable by every other; and if clerks were sent round to receive the amount in due from each it would occupy much time and be with some risk and house in london this is avoided by making all checks paid in to bankers pass through what is called the house in a large room in lombard street about thirty clerks from the several london bankers take their in order at desks placed round the room; each having a small open box by his side and the name of the firm to which he belongs in large on the wall above his head from time to time other clerks from every house enter the room and passing along drop into the box the checks due by that firm to the house from which this is sent the clerk at the table enters the amount of the several checks in a book under the name of the bank to which they are due four o'clock in the is the latest hour to which the boxes are open to receive checks; and at a few minutes before that time some signs of begin to appear in this quiet and scene clerks then arrive anxious to up to the latest moment the checks which have been paid into the houses of their at four o'clock all the boxes are removed and each clerk adds up the amount of the checks put into his box and payable by his own to other houses he also another book from his own house the amounts of the checks which their clerk has put into the box of every other banker having these he writes out the due to or from his own house the name of each of the other banks; and having this by a with the similar list made by the clerks of those houses he sends to his own bank the general balance from this sheet the amount of which if it is due from that to other houses is sent back in at five o'clock the takes his seat; when each clerk who has upon the result of all the a balance to pay to various other houses pays it to the who gives a ticket for the amount the clerks of those houses to whom money is due then receive the several sums from the who takes from them a ticket for the amount thus the whole of these are made by a double system of balance a very small amount of passing from hand to hand and any coin it is to form a of the sums which daily pass through this they from two to perhaps fifteen about two and a half may be as like an average for its perhaps l in bank notes and l in specie by an between the bankers all checks which have the name of any firm written across them must pass through the house if any such check should be lost the firm on which it is drawn would refuse to pay it at the a which adds greatly to the of the of this system is such that two a day have been at twelve the other at three but the payment of takes place once only at five o'clock if all the private banks kept with the bank of england it would be to carry on the whole of these with a still smaller of medium in on the with which these vast are for the sake of that they form only the fourth part of the daily of the whole is not to be struck with the of as little as with their natural each payment a of made for the benefit of both and if it were which it is not to place by legal or other means some in the way which only to per cent such a species of would produce a useless of nearly four a which is the of those who doubt the good policy of the expense by using the metals for one portion of the of the country one of the most obvious between a and a paper is that the coin can never by any panic or danger be reduced below the value of bullion in other whilst a paper may from the action of such causes totally lose its value both and paper money it is true may be but with very effects of coin the state may issue coin of the same nominal value but only half the of gold mixed with some cheap alloy; but every piece so issued bears about with it of the amount of the it is not that every should analyse the new coin; but a few having done so its worth becomes known of course the coin in is now more as bullion and quickly all future adjust to the new and prices are quickly but all past also are and all persons to whom money is owing if to receive payment in the new coin are robbed of onehalf of their debt which is for the benefit of the debtor of paper the of paper money follows a course if by any act of the paper is to be a legal tender for debts and at the same time ceases to be for coin those who have to of who are not to take the notes will make some of their in gold; and if the issue of paper by the power of the gold it be the whole of the coin will soon but the public who are obliged to take the notes are unable by any to detect the extent of their it varies with the amount in and may go on till the notes shall be worth little more than the paper on which they are printed during the whole of this time every is to an extent which he cannot and every bargain is in its by the value of the medium through which it is this course has been run in several in france it reached nearly its extreme limit during the of we have some portion of the misery it but by a return to sounder have happily escaped the and ruin which always attends the of that career every person in a country to his station in life the use of a certain of money to make the of the which he the same pieces of coin it is true again and again in the same the piece of silver by the workman on night passing through the hands of the butcher the baker and the small is perhaps given by the latter to the in for his check and is again paid into the hands of the workman at the end of the week any in this supply of money is with to all parties if it be only in the smaller coins the first effect is a in small change; then a in the to refuse change unless a to a certain amount be made; and finally a premium in money will be given for the larger of coin thus money itself varies in price when by other money in larger masses and this effect takes place whether the medium is or of paper these effects have and during the late war; and in order to relieve it silver tokens for various sums were issued by the bank of england the and loss arising from a of small money fall with weight on the classes whose means are least; for the buyers can readily procure credit for their small until their bill amounts to one of the larger coins as money when kept in a drawer nothing few people in any of life will keep either in coin or in notes more than is for their use; when there are no modes of money a of paper will return to the source from whence it issued and an excess of coin will be into bullion and since the worth of all is by money it is to the general welfare of the that in its value should be as small and as gradual as the evils which result from sudden changes in the value of money will perhaps become more if we trace their effects in as we are quite at liberty to do an extreme case let us suppose three persons each a hundred pounds one of these a widow in years and who by the advice of her friends with that sum an annuity of twenty pounds a year during her life and let the two others be workmen who by and economy have each saved a hundred pounds out of their wages; both these latter persons to procure for and to that one of these invests his money in a bank; to make his own machine and that he shall expend twenty pounds in and the eighty in himself and in paying the workmen who assist him in it the other workman meeting with a machine which he can buy for two hundred pounds agrees to pay for it a hundred pounds and the at the end of a let us now imagine some to take place in the by which it is onehalf prices soon adjust to the new and the annuity of the widow though of the same amount will in reality only half the of the of life which it did before the workman who had placed his money in the bank having perhaps ten pounds' worth of and ten pounds in labour applied to them now finds himself by this in the of eighty pounds but in reality of a sum which will only half the labour and to finish his and he can neither it from want of capital nor dispose of what he has already done in its state for the price it has cost him in the the other workman who had a debt of a hundred pounds in order to the of his machine finds that the he for have like all other prices doubled in of the of the and he has in fact his machine for one hundred and fifty pounds thus without any fault or and owing to over which they have no control the widow is reduced almost to starve; one workman is obliged to for several years his hope of a master; and another without any or skill but in fact from having made with to his rather an bargain finds himself from half his debt and the of a source of profit; whilst the former owner of the machine if he also has the money arising from its sale in the bank finds his reduced onehalf these evils to a greater or less extent attend every change in the value of the and the of it as far as in value cannot be too upon all classes of the notes in russia has been for coin; and it a which notice cannot be melted in our and is chiefly in when in the shape of ingots from which it may be forged into useful forms but when a piece of is cut into two parts it cannot easily be except by means of a process in which both parts are in an acid hence when coin is too it cannot like gold be reduced into masses by melting but must pass through an process to render it useful chapter on the of on price the money price of an article at any given period is usually stated to depend upon the between the supply and the demand the average price of the same article during a long period is said to depend on the power of and selling it with the profits of capital but these true in their general sense are yet so often by the of others that it becomes to examine a little into the forces with respect to the first of these it may be that the cost of any article to the besides the ratio of the supply to the demand another element which though often of little is in many cases of great the cost to the is the price he pays for any article added to the cost of the fact of its having that degree of for which he in some cases the of the article is evident on mere and in those cases there is not much of price at shops the of loaf sugar for can be almost at a glance; and the is that the price is so uniform and the profit upon it so small that no grocer is at all anxious to sell it; whilst on the other hand tea of which it is to judge and which can be by mixture so as to deceive the skill even of a eye has a great variety of prices and is that article which every grocer is most anxious to sell to his the and expense of are in some so great as to justify the from thus it is a general maxim that can any article at a cheaper rate than that at which they can it but it has been more to build such are those at and to grind their own corn than to verify each sack of flour and to employ persons in methods of the new modes of which might be to some years since a mode of old clover and trefoil seeds by a process called became so as to excite the of the house of commons it in before a that the old seed of the white clover was by first wetting it and then drying it with the fumes of burning sulphur and that the red clover seed had its colour by shaking it in a sack with a small of indigo; but this being after a time the doctors then used a of logwood fined by a little and by thus at once the of the old seed and if not its power already by age no injury had to good seed so it was proved that from the the market price would be by this process from five to a hundred weight but the evil arose from the of these old and seed equal in to the best one witness had tried some seed and found that not above one grain in a hundred grew and that those which did died away whilst about eighty or ninety per cent of good seed usually grows the seed so treated was sold to retail dealers in the country who of course to at the rate and from them it got into the hands of the neither of these classes being capable of the from the genuine seed many in their of the and others were obliged to pay a higher price to those who had skill to the mixed seed and who had and to prevent them from dealing in it in the irish flax trade a similar example of the high price paid for occurs it is stated in the report of the that the natural quality of irish flax as with foreign or british has been yet from the before that it appears that irish flax sells in the market from d to d per pound less than other flax of equal or quality part of this of price arises from in its but a part also from the expense of that each parcel is free from useless matter to add to its weight this appears from the of mr j corry who was during years to the irish the owners of the flax who are almost always people in the lower classes of life believe that they can best advance their own by on the buyers flax being sold by weight various are used to it; and every is the damping of it; a very common which makes the flax heat the inside of every bundle and the bundles all vary in bulk is often full of pebbles or dirt of various kinds to the weight in this state it is and to great britain the natural quality of irish flax is to be not to that by any foreign and yet the flax of every foreign country into great britain obtains a amongst the because the foreign flax is brought to the british market in a cleaner and more regular state the extent and value of the sales of foreign flax in great britain can be seen by to the public and i am induced to believe that ireland by an of her flax tillage and having her flax markets brought under good could without in the least degree upon the for her home supply the whole of the demand of the british market to the of the the lace trade affords other and in into the made to the house of commons by the the observe that it is that the most of one hundred and fifty years ago should in the present state of the trade be the same which is now most of for it appears by the given before your that all the the decay of the trade more to the making of and bad than to the war or to any other cause and it is shewn by the that a kind of lace called was which good to the eye became nearly spoiled in washing by the of the that not one person in a could the between and lace; and that even workmen and were obliged to employ a glass for that and that in another similar article called warp lace such aid was it was also stated by one witness that the trade had not yet ceased in those places where the fraud had been and from those places no orders are now sent for any sort of lace the credit being totally ruined in the trade similar frauds have been it in that were made of uniform width from the knee down to the ankle and being wetted and on frames at the calf they their shape when dry but that the could not the fraud until after the first washing the hung like bags about his ankles in the watch trade the of deceit in forging the marks and names of makers has been carried to a great extent both by natives and and the effect upon our export trade has been most as the extract from the before a of the house of commons will prove how long have you been in the trade? answer nearly thirty years the trade is at present much answer yes sadly what is your opinion of the cause of that answer i think it is owing to a number of watches that have been made so bad that they will hardly look at them in the foreign all with a outside show and the works hardly fit for do you mean to say that all the watches made in this country are of that answer no; only a number which are made up by some of the jews and other low i of the sort years ago of a falloff of the east india work owing to there being a number of watches sent out for with hands on and figures as if they shewed seconds and had not any work regular to shew the seconds the hand went round but it was not regular they had no perfect answer no they had not; that was a long time since and we had not any east india work for a long time in the home market but showy watches are made at a cheap rate which are not by the maker to go above half an hour; about the time by the jew pedlar in his country the in retail shops of calling certain yard wide when the real width is perhaps only or arose at first from fraud which being custom was pleaded in its defence but the result is that the vender is obliged to measure the width of his goods in the in all these the object of the seller is to get a higher price than his goods would really produce if their quality were known; and the if not himself a skilful judge which rarely happens to be the case must pay some person in the shape of an money price who has skill to and to furnish of the quality agreed on but as the of persons in their own is usually great large numbers will always flock to the cheap dealer who thus many from the honest obliges him to charge a higher price for his and than without such he could afford to do there are few things which the public are less able to judge of than the quality of drugs; and when these are into it is even for medical men to decide whether pure or have been this with the present mode of paying for medical has a curious effect on the price of instead of being paid for their and skill are by being allowed to place a high charge upon their which are of very small value the effect of such a system is an to more than is and in fact even with the present charges the in cases out of a hundred cannot be fairly unless the patient either takes or pays for more physic than he really the of the charge of pence for a phial of is obvious to many who do not reflect on the fact that a great part of the charge is in reality payment for the of skill as the same charge is made by the whether he attends the patient or merely the of a the chemist and soon offered to furnish the same at a greatly price but the pence charged by the might have been fairly divided into two parts three pence for and bottle and fifteen pence for the chemist who never attends his if he charges only a for the same a profit of or per cent upon its value this profit has called into a of and in this the of has in a great measure the effects of the general of drugs even at the high price at which they are as enables those who are to sell them in an state to make large profits whilst the same evil the and defeats the skill of the most eminent it is to point out a remedy for this evil without an almost total change in the system of medical if the were to charge for his visits and to reduce his to or of their present price he would still have an in the best drugs for the sake of his own or skill or if the medical who is paid more highly for his time were to have several pupils he might himself supply the without a charge and his pupils would derive from them as well as from the purity of the drugs he would the public would gain several by this in the first place it would be greatly for the of the medical to have the best drugs; it would be in his also not to give more physic than and it would enable him through some of his more pupils to watch more the changes of any malady there are many of which it is for the to verify at the time of or even without them plated harness and coach may be adduced as these are usually of wrought iron covered with silver owing their to the one and a certain degree of beauty to the other metal both are much by cast for and by plating with soft solder tin and lead instead of with hard solder silver and brass the loss of is the evil in this case; for cast iron though made for this purpose more tough than usual by careful is still much weaker than and serious often arise from harness giving way in plating with soft solder a very thin plate of silver is made to cover the iron but it is easily by a low degree of heat hard gives a better coat of silver which is very firmly and is not easily injured unless by a very high degree of heat the can be made to look nearly as well as the better article and the can the without cutting into it the that price at any moment is on the of the supply to the demand is true to the full extent only when the whole supply is in the hands of a very large number of small holders and the demand is caused by the wants of another set of persons each of whom only a very small and the reason appears to be that it is only in such that a uniform average can be struck between the the the the and the of both parties if the supply or present stock in hand be in the of one person he will to put such a price upon it as shall produce by its sale the of money; but he will be guided in this of the price at which he will sell both by the that price will cause a and by the desire to realize his profit before a new supply shall reach the market from some other quarter if however the same stock is in the hands of several dealers there will be an between them arising partly from their views of the of the present state of supply and partly from their own with respect to the of their capital the expense of that the price charged is that which is legally due is the which this in the case of parcels sent by coaches is very great the time lost in an amounts to so many times the value of the sum that it is but rarely to it seems worthy of whether it would not be a to the public if were to the general of parcels on the same system with that on which the post is now the of their and the absence of all attempt at would render the of rival perhaps an might be made on this subject by the weight allowed to be sent by the post and by works in sheets by the general post this latter would be of great to and to the of as the stand at present it happens that persons who have an for science receive by post from foreign works or parts of works for which they are obliged to pay a most rate of postage or else refuse to take in some in france and germany printed sheets of paper are by post at a very expense and it is fit that the science and of england should be equally it is if always to connect the name of the workman with the work he has this secures for him the credit or the blame he may justly and in some cases the of the extent to which this is carried in works in america is in the of the celeste by mr not merely the name of the printer but also those of the are in the work again if the itself is of a nature such for example as a cargo of ice into the port of london from norway a few summers since then time will supply the place of and whether the article is in the of one or of many persons it will reach a price the history of cajeput oil during the last few months offers a curious of the effect of opinion upon price in july of last year cajeput oil was sold of duty at d per ounce the disease which had ravaged the east was then to be our shores and its created alarm at this period the oil in began to be much talked of as a remedy in that and in it rose to the price of s and s the ounce in october there were few or no sales but in the early part of the in this reached their height and between the st and the th it the prices s d s s d s d s s s s d s after the holders of cajeput oil were anxious to sell at much lower rates; and in a fresh arrival was offered by public sale at s and being sold as it was by private at s or s d per oz since that time s d and s have been and a fresh arrival which is daily march will reduce it below the price of july now it is to notice that in the time of the in the market was held by few persons and that it changed hands each holder being to realize his profit the since that time has also been the effect of the of price by an number of dealers may be in the price of the various sold at the stock the number of persons who deal in the per cent stock being large any one of selling can always dispose of his stock at per cent under the market price; but those who wish to dispose of bank stock or of any other of more limited are obliged to make a of eight or ten times this amount upon each hundred pounds value the in oil tallow and other which must occur to the memory of most of my readers were always founded on the of up all the stock on hand and for the of the thus proving the opinion of to be that a larger average price may be by the stock being held by few persons notes these phials at the old bottle at ten per gross; so that when their servant has washed them the cost of the phial is nearly one penny i have that the price of camphor at the same time similar changes chapter on the of on price having now the that modify what may be called the amount of price we must next examine a which seems to have an effect on its average the of any its cost in a manner we have already stated that what may be called the price of any depends upon the between the supply and demand and also upon the cost of the average price during a long period will depend upon the labour for and it to market as well as upon the average supply and demand; but it will also be by the of the article many things in common use are in using a match of food and a cigar are of this some things after use become to their former as paper which has been printed upon but it is yet for the or the some as pens are quickly worn out by use; and some are still after a long wear there are others few perhaps in number which never wear out; the harder stones when well cut and are of this later class the fashion of the gold or silver in which they are set may vary with the taste of the age and such are exposed for sale as but the gems when removed from their are never so a which has graced the necks of a hundred or for a century upon brows is weighed by the diamond in the same scale with another which has just escaped from the wheel of the and will be or sold by him at the same price per carat the great mass of is in its between these two and the periods of are very various it is evident that the average price of those things which are in the act of using them can never be less than that of the labour of them to market they may for a short time be sold for less but under such their must soon cease on the other hand if an article never wears out its price may below the cost of the labour in it; and the only will be that no further will take place its price will to be by the of the supply to the demand; and should that at any rise for a period above the cost of it will be again become old from actual decay or the wearing out of their parts; from modes of them; or from changes in their form and fashion by the varying taste of the age in the two latter cases their utility is but little and being less sought after by those who have them they are sold at a reduced price to a class of society rather below that of their former many of such as tables and chairs are thus found in the rooms of those who would have been quite unable to have them when new; and we find even in the houses of the more opulent large which have passed through the hands of several only the fashion of their frames; and in some even this is omitted an coat of gilding saving them from the of being thus a taste for is in and after a short period the numbers who have new wants become to excite the of the to reduce the cost of them whilst he is himself by the scale of demand there is a in with to the just the most of injury to them arises from

great as to break it into many these smaller pieces may be cut into squares for and if the is injured it can either be or used as for glazing windows the from our to the stock of in the country is about two hundred and fifty square feet it would be very to the or but it is small; and the effect of these is seen in the price and of the article almost all the better order of shop fronts are now

will only add that the result of my own leads me to believe that by far the most of these causes has been the of cheaper modes of the extent to which this can be carried while a profit can yet be at

that of the same kind and of cloth in england two ago we must find the number of days' labour the cloth would have in england at the time and compare it with the number of days' labour which the same of cloth will now in saxony labour appears to have been because it exists in all and employs a large number of persons and also because it a very small degree of it seems in fact to be merely the of a man's force; and its value above that of a machine of equal power arises from its and from the of its efforts to and it may perhaps be worthy of enquiry whether a more average might not be deduced from with this species of labour those trades which require but a of skill and which exist in all such as those of the and etc in all such there is however another element which though not will yet add much to our means of judging it is an of the of that food on which the usually which is for his daily support with the which his daily wages will the of a class of between small and is to both and there are certain periods in the history of several which call that class of traders into there are also times when the ceasing the custom of them also the when as they are in retail trades the price

journey on account of the illness of a mother or some and to have his cousin or brother for him the english rarely fails to in this change and often praises the filial piety of the rogue who has him notes much for such an enquiry is to be found for the period to which it refers in the report of the of the house of commons on july chapter of raw the cost of any article may be reduced in its to the of labour by which it was yet it is usual in a certain state of the of most to call them by the term raw thus iron when reduced from the ore and is in a state fitted for to a of useful and is the raw out of which most of our tools are made in this stage of its but a of labour has been on the and it becomes an subject to trace the various in which raw in this sense of the term and labour unite to the value of many of the of the arts gold leaf of a portion of the metal beaten out to so great a degree of as to allow a light to be through its pores about square inches of this are sold in the form of a small book leaves of gold for s d in this case the raw or gold is worth rather less than of the article in the case of silver leaf the labour exceeds the value of the a book of fifty leaves which would cover above square inches is sold for s d we may trace the of the two causes above to in the prices of fine gold chains made at venice the sizes of these chains are known by numbers the having been in no and the numbers etc in size the table shews the numbers and the prices of those made at that time the first column gives the number by which the chain is known; the second the weight in

gold chains price of a braccio equal to weight of number of links two feet inch no one inch in grains in one inch english to francs amongst these chains that and that are exactly of the same price the of gold in the latter is times as much as in the former the of making the chain is so great that the women who make it cannot work above two hours at a time as we advance from the smaller chain the value of the work to the worth of the becomes less and less until at the numbers and these two of cost balance each other after which the of the work and the value of the the of labour on these chains is however less than that which is applied in some of the of iron in the case of the chain the value of the labour is not above thirty times that of the gold the spring of a watch which governs the of

chapter on the of labour perhaps the most on which the economy of a depends is the of labour amongst the persons who perform the work the first of this must have been made in a very early stage of society for it must soon have been that a larger number of and could be by each if one man his to the art of making bows another to that of houses a third boats and so on this of labour into trades was not however the result of an opinion that the general riches of the would be by such an but it must have arisen from the of each so that he himself could thus make a greater profit of his labour than by more varied society must have made before this could have been carried into the for it is only in which have a high degree of and in in which there is a great amongst the that the most perfect system of the of labour is to be the various on which the of this system depend have been much the subject of amongst writers on but the of their does not appear in all cases to have been with it is my in the first to state shortly those and then to point out what appears to me to have been omitted by those who have treated the subject of the time for it will readily be that the portion of time in the of any art will depend on the of its and that the greater the number of the longer will be the time which the must employ in it five or seven years have been adopted in a great many trades as the time for a lad to acquire a of his art and to enable him to repay by his labour during the latter portion of his time the expense by his master at its if however instead of all the for making a needle for his be to one the portion of time at the of his will be small and all the rest of it will be to his master and if there be any amongst the masters the will be able to make better terms and the period of his again the of skill in a single process and the early period of life at which it can be made a source of profit will induce a greater number of parents to bring up their to it; and from this also the number of workmen being the wages will soon fall of waste of in a certain of will in all cases be or spoiled by every person who learns an art; and as he applies himself to each new process he will waste some of the raw or of the partly but if each man commit this waste in every process the of waste will be much greater than if each person confine his to one in this view of the subject the of labour will the price of another from the of labour is the saving of that portion of time which is always lost in from one to another when the human hand or the human head has been for some time in any kind of work it cannot change its with full effect the muscles of the limbs have a during their and those not in action a during rest which renders every change slow and unequal in the long habit also in the muscles a for fatigue to a much greater degree than they could support under other a similar result seems to take place in any change of mental the on the new subject not being so perfect at first as it becomes after some change of tools the of tools in the is another cause of the loss of time in from one to another if these tools are simple and the change is not the loss of time is not but in many of the arts the tools are of great every time they are used; and in many cases the time in bears a large to that in using the tool the the and the are of this kind; and hence in of extent it is found to be good economy to keep one machine in one kind of work one lathe for example having a screw motion to its along the whole length of its bed is kept making another having a motion for the of the work at the point at which it passes the tool is kept for facing whilst a third is in cutting wheels skill by of the same the of the same process in the workman a degree of and in his which is never by a person who is obliged to execute many this is still further from the that most of the in where the of labour is carried to a extent are paid for as it is to in numbers the effect of this cause upon in adam smith has stated that it is almost three to one; for he that a smith to make nails but whose whole has not been that of a nailer can make only from eight hundred to a per day; whilst a lad who had never any other trade can make upwards of two three hundred a day in trades the economy of arising from the cause will be the case of is perhaps rather an extreme one it must however be that in one sense this is not a source of for though it acts at the of an yet every month adds to the skill of the and at the end of three or four years they will not be very far behind those who have never any other branch of their art upon an when a large issue of was a clerk at the bank of england signed his name of seven letters the initial of his name five three hundred times during eleven working hours besides the notes he had signed in parcels of fifty each the of labour the of tools and to execute its when each by which any article is is the sole of one his whole being devoted to a very limited and simple in the form of his tools or in the mode of using them are much more likely to occur to his mind than if it were by a greater variety of such an in the tool is the first step towards a machine if a piece of metal is to be cut in a lathe for example there is one angle at which the must be held to insure the cut; and it is quite natural that the idea of fixing the tool at that angle should present itself to an workman the of moving the tool slowly and in a to itself would suggest the use of a screw and thus arises the it was the idea of a chisel in a frame to prevent its cutting too deeply which gave rise to the common plane in cases where a blow from a hammer is teaches the proper force the from the hammer held in the hand to one mounted upon an axis and lifted to a certain height by some perhaps a greater degree of than those just yet it is not to that if the hammer always falls from the same height its effect must be always the same when each process has been reduced to the use of some simple tool the union of all these tools by one moving power a machine in tools and the workmen are perhaps most but it far other habits to combine into one machine these arts a as a workman in the trade is a but in order to make such with any of success an of and the power of making are these are now much more common than they were and their absence was perhaps one of the causes of the of in the early history of many of our such are the usually as the causes of the from the of labour as in the view i have taken of the the most and cause has been i shall restate those in the words of adam smith the great in the of work which in of the of labour the same number of people are capable of is owing to three first to the of in every to the saving of time which is lost in passing from one species of work to and lastly to the of a great number of which and abridge labour and enable one man to do the work of many now all these are causes and each has its on the result; yet it appears to me that any of the of as upon the of labour would be if the were omitted to be stated that the master by the work to be into each degrees of skill or of force can exactly that precise of both which is for each whereas if the whole work were by one workman that person must possess skill to perform the most and to execute the most of the into which the art is divided as the clear of this upon which a great part of the economy arising from the of labour depends is of it may be to point out its precise and in some the art of making needles is perhaps that which i should have for this as a very large number of in their nature; but the less art of has some claim to from its having been used by adam smith; and i am in the choice of it by the of our a very and minute of that art as in france above half a century ago in the of pins in england the are a the brass wire used for making pins is by the in coils of about inches in each about pounds b the coils are wound off into smaller ones of about six inches in and between one and two pounds' weight c the of this wire is now reduced by drawing it through holes in steel plates until it becomes of the size for the sort of pins to be made during this process the wire is and to prevent its it must be two or three times to the of d the coils are then soaked in acid largely diluted with water in order to clean them and are then beaten on stone for the purpose of any coating which may adhere to them these are usually by men who draw and clean from thirty to pounds of wire a day they are paid at the rate of five per pound and earn about s d per day m made some on the the wire in passing through each hole he took a piece of thick swedish brass wire and found feet inches its length to be before drawing after passing the first hole second hole third hole it was now and the length became after passing the fourth hole fifth hole sixth hole and finally after passing through six other holes the holes through which the wire was drawn were not in this of it is to make such holes and still more to them in their the wire the coil of wire now passes into the hands of a woman by a boy or girl a few nails or iron pins not quite in a line are fixed into one end of a wooden table about twenty feet in length; the end of the wire is passed between these nails and is then pulled to the other end of the table the object of this process is to the wire which had a in the small coils in which it had been wound the length thus is cut off and the of the coil is drawn into similar lengths about seven nails or pins are in the wire and their is a matter of some nicety it seems that by passing the wire between the first three nails or pins a bend is in an to that which the wire had in the coil; this bend by passing the next two nails is reduced to another less curved in the first and so on till the curve of the wire may at last be with a line a a man next takes about three hundred of these pieces in a parcel and putting them into a gauge cuts off from one end by means of a pair of shears moved by his foot a portion equal in length to rather more than six pins he this until the entire parcel is reduced into similar pieces b the next step is to sharpen the ends for this purpose the sits before a steel mill which is kept rapidly it of a about six inches in and two and a half inches broad faced with steel which is cut in the manner of a file another is fixed on the same axis at a few inches the file on the edge of which is of a finer kind and is used for off the points the workman now takes up a parcel of the wires between the finger and thumb of each hand and presses the ends on the mill taking care with his fingers and thumbs to make each wire slowly revolve upon its axis having thus pointed all the pieces at one end he them and the same on the other this process skill but it is not whilst the similar process in is of health c the pieces now pointed at both ends are next placed in gauges and the pointed ends are cut off by means of shears to the proper length of which the pins are to be made the of the wire are now equal to about four pins in length and are again pointed at each end and their lengths again cut off this process is a third time and the small portion of wire left in the middle is thrown amongst the waste to be melted along with the dust arising from the it is usual for a man his wife and a child to join in these and they are paid at the rate of five per pound they can point from to and a half pounds per day and gain from s d to s which may be thus; s d the man s the woman d to the boy or girl and cutting the heads the next process is making the heads for this purpose a a boy takes a piece of wire of the same as the pin to be headed which he fixes on an axis that can be made to revolve rapidly by means of a wheel and strap with it this wire is called the mould he then takes a smaller wire which having passed through an eye in a small tool held in his left hand he fixes close to the bottom of the mould the mould is now made to revolve rapidly by means of the right hand and the smaller wire coils round it until it has covered the whole length of the mould the boy now cuts the end of the spiral with the foot of the mould and draws it off b when a of heading is thus made a man takes from to twenty of these spirals in his left hand between his thumb and three outer fingers these he places in such a manner that two turns of the spiral shall be beyond the upper edge of a pair of shears and with the of the same hand he feels that only two turns do so project with his right hand he closes the shears; and the two turns of the spiral being cut off drop into a basin; the of the the heads from flying about when cut off the workmen who cut the heads are usually paid at the rate of d to d per pound for large heads but a higher price is given for the smaller heading out of this they pay the boy who spins the spiral; he from d to d a day a good workman can cut from six to about thirty pounds of heading per day to its size heading the process of fixing the head on the body of the pin is usually by women and each sits before a small steel stake having a cavity into which one half of the head will fit; above is a steel die having a cavity for the other half of the head this latter die can be raised by a pedal moved by the foot the weight of the hammer is from seven to ten pounds and it falls through a very small space perhaps from one to two inches the in the centre of these dies are with the edge of a small groove to admit of the body of the pin which is thus from being by the blow of the die a the with his left hand dips the pointed end of the body of a pin into a tray of heads; having passed the point through one of them he carries it along to the other end with the he now takes the pin in the right hand and places the head in the cavity of the stake and lifting the die with his foot allows it to fall on the head this blow the head on the shank which is then turned round and the head three or four blows on parts of its the women and who fix the heads are paid at the rate of s d for every twenty a skilful can with great do twenty per day but from ten to fifteen is the usual head a much smaller number varying of course with the degree of their skill about one per cent of the pins are spoiled in the these are picked out by women and are along with the waste from other for the the die in which the heads are struck is varied in form to the fashion of the time; but the blows to which it is subject render it that it should be after it has been used for about thirty pounds of pins tinning the pins are now fit to be tinned a process which is usually by a man by his wife or by a lad the of pins upon at this stage is usually pounds a they are first placed in a pickle in order to remove any grease or dirt from their surface and also to render them rough which the of the tin with which they are to be covered b they are then placed in a boiler full of a of tartar in water in which they are mixed with a of tin in small grains in this they are kept boiling for about two hours and a half and are then removed into a tub of water into which some bran has been thrown for the purpose of washing off the acid liquor c they are then taken out and being placed in wooden trays are well shaken in dry bran this removes any water to them; and by giving the wooden tray a kind of motion the pins are thrown up and the bran flies off and leaves them behind in the tray the man who pickles and tins the pins usually gets one penny per pound for the work and employs himself during the boiling of one batch of pins in drying those tinned he can earn about s per day; but out of this he pays about s for his the pins come from the tinner in wooden bowls with the points in all the of them side by side in paper is by women a a woman takes up some and places them on a comb and shaking them some of the pins fall back into the bowl and the rest being caught by their heads are between the teeth of the comb b having thus them in a she fixes the number between two pieces of iron having small grooves at equal c and having doubled the paper she presses it against the points of the pins until they have passed through the two folds which are to retain them the pins are then from the grasp of the tool and the process is a woman gains about s d per day by but are who earn from d per day and upwards having thus the various of and having stated the usual cost of each it will be to present a tabular view of the time by each process and its cost as well as the sums which can be earned by the persons who confine solely to each process as the rate of wages is itself and as the prices paid and have been given only between certain limits it is not to be that this table can the cost of each part of the work with the nor even that it shall accord with the prices above given but it has been drawn up with some care and will be quite to serve as the basis of those which it is meant to a table nearly similar will be which has been deduced from a of m the art of in france above seventy years ago english pins elevens weigh one pound; one dozen = pins weigh twenty ounces and require six ounces of paper name of the process workman time for making lb of pins hours cost of making lb of pins pence workmen earns per day s d price of making each part of a single pin in of a penny drawing wire man wire woman girl man and cutting heads boy man heading woman tinning or man woman woman number of persons men ; women ; total french cost of pins no each being of an english inch in they were in france about ; with the cost of each deduced from the and of m name of the process time for making twelve pins hours cost of making twelve pins pence workman usually earns per day pence expense of tools and pence wire and cutting coarse turning wheel fine turning wheel cutting off pointed ends turning spiral cutting off heads fuel to anneal ditto heading tartar for tartar for paper wear of tools the great expense of turning the wheel appears to have arisen from the person so being during half his time whilst the pointer went to another it appears from the we have given of the art of that it rather more than seven hours and a half of time for ten working in on the same to convert it into a pound of pins; and that the total expense of their labour each being paid in the joint ratio of his skill and of the time he is amounts very nearly to s d but from an of the first of these tables it appears that the wages earned by the persons vary from d per day up to s and the skill which is for their may be by those sums now it is evident that if one person were to make the whole pound of pins he must have skill enough to earn about s d per day whilst he is the wires or cutting off the heads from the spiral s when he is the pins; which three would occupy little more than the part of his time it is also that during more than one half of his time he must be earning only s d per day in putting on the heads; his skill if would in the same time produce nearly five times as much if we were to employ for all the the man who whitens the pins and who earns s per day even that he could make the pound of pins in an equally short time yet we must pay him for his time pence or about s d the pins would cost in making three times and three as much as they now do by the of the of labour the higher the skill of the workman in any one process of a and the smaller the time during which it is so much the greater will be the of that process from the rest and one to it had we the art of as our the economy arising from the of labour would have been still more for the process of the needles great skill and and from three to four are at once the workman is paid a very high rate of wages in another process of the same which also is with great the wages earned by the workman reach from s to s s and even in some to s per day; whilst other are carried on by paid at the rate of d per day some further by the will be until we have placed before the reader a brief of a machine for making pins by an it is highly in point of and in respect to its will furnish a strong and with the of pins by the human hand in this machine a coil of brass wire is placed on an axis; one end of this wire is drawn by a pair of rollers through a small hole in a plate of steel and is held there by a forceps as soon as the machine is put in action the forceps draws the wire on to a equal in length to one pin a cutting edge of steel then close to the hole through which the wire entered and severs the piece drawn out the forceps holding the piece thus moves on till it brings the wire to the centre of the chuck of a small lathe which opens to receive it whilst the forceps is to fetch another piece of wire the lathe rapidly and grinds the end of the wire upon a steel mill which towards it after this first or coarse the lathe stops and another forceps takes hold of the pin which is by the opening of the chuck and conveys it to a similar chuck of an lathe which it and the on a finer steel mill this mill again stops and another forceps removes the pointed pin into a pair of strong steel clams having a small groove in them by which they hold the pin very firmly a part of this groove which at that edge of the steel clams which is to form the head of the pin is made conical a small round steel punch is now driven against the end of the wire thus clamped and the head of the pin is formed by the wire into the conical cavity notes i have already stated that this itself to me after a of a number of and devoted to but i have since found that it had been pointed out in the work of gioja nuovo delle scienze tom to milano tom i capo iv the great expense of turning the wheel appears to have arisen from the person so being during half his time whilst the pointer went to another chapter on the of labour we have already what may perhaps appear to some of our readers that the of labour can be applied with equal success to mental as to and that it ensures in both the same economy of time a short account of its in the most series of ever will offer an of this fact whilst at the same time it will afford an for shewing that the which ought to the economy of a are founded on of deeper root than may have been and are capable of being in the road to some of the of the human mind in the midst of that which the of france and the wars the of the nation by its fatal passion for renown was at the same time to some of the nobler and more which mark the era of a and which receive the of long after their have been wrested from them or even when their as a nation may be told only by the page of history amongst their of science the french was of a series of tables to the of the decimal system which they had so adopted they their to such tables on the most scale their most fully to the call of their country new methods for this task; and a work the large demands of the was in a short period of time m prony to whom the of this great was in of its je

in this out of five or six of the most eminent in france first section the duty of this first section was to amongst the various which could be found for the same that which was most readily adapted to simple by many at the same time this section had little or nothing to do with the actual work when its labours were the on the use of which it had decided were to the second section second section this section of seven or eight persons of with and their duty was to convert into numbers the put into their hands by the first section an of great labour; and then to deliver out these to the members of the third section and receive from them the the members of this second section had certain means of the without the of or even of the whole of the work done by the third section third section the members of this section whose number varied from sixty to eighty certain numbers from the second section and using nothing more than simple and they to that section the tables in a state it is that of this class had no of beyond the two first rules which they were thus called upon to and that these persons were usually found more correct in their than those who a more of the subject when it is stated that the tables thus occupy large folio volumes some idea may perhaps be formed of the labour from that part by the third class which may almost be termed the least and by far the the first class were exempt such labour can always be at an easy rate the duties of the second class skill in were yet in some measure by the higher felt in those more the of the first class are not likely to require upon another so much skill and labour as they did upon the first attempt to such a method; but when the of a engine shall have a for the whole of the third section of the of will be to its by a new of the methods of into numbers the of m prony in this system of much that of a skilful person about to a cotton or silk mill or any similar having by his own genius or through the aid of his friends found that some may be applied to his pursuit he makes of his plans of the and may himself be as the first section he next the of capable of the he has some of whom should the nature of the to be carried on; and these his second section when a number of have been made a of other persons of a lower degree of skill must be in using them; these form the third section but their work and the just of the must be still by the second class as the of by may appear to readers to be rather too large a and as it is with the subject of the of labour i shall here in a few lines to give some slight of the manner in which this can be doneand thus to remove a small portion of the veil which covers that mystery that nearly all tables of numbers which follow any law however may be formed to a greater or less extent solely by the proper of the and of numbers each table is a general which can be to those only who are well with but the mind even of the reader who is but very with that science will readily that it is not by to the example the table is the of one in very use which has been printed and very in many and is called a table of square numbers terms of table a table b first c second any number in the table column a may be by the number which the of that term from the of the table by itself; thus is the fifth term from the of the table and by itself or by is equal to let us now each term of this table from the next term and place the results in another column b which may be called first column if we again each term of this first from the term we find the result is always the number column c; and that the same number will always recur in that column which may be called the second will appear to any person who takes the trouble to carry on the table a few terms further now when once this is it is quite clear that the first term of the table the first term of the first and the first term of the second or are given we can the table of square numbers to any extent merely by for the series of first may be formed by adding the to the first number in column b and we then have the series of numbers etc and again by adding each of these to the first number of the table we produce the square numbers having thus i hope thrown some light upon the part of the i shall to shew that the of such an engine as would produce this series of numbers is not so far removed from that of as might be let the reader imagine three clocks placed on a table side by side each having only one hand and each having a instead of twelve hours marked on the face; and every time a string is pulled let them strike on a bell the numbers of the to which their hands point let him further suppose that two of the clocks for the sake of called b and c have some by which the clock c the hand of the clock b one for each stroke it makes upon its own bell and let the clock b by a similar advance the hand of the clock a one for each stroke it makes on its own bell with such an having set the hand of the clock a to the i that of b to iii and that of c to ii let the reader imagine the parts of the clocks to be set in motion in the order vizpull the string of clock a; pull the string of clock b; pull the string of clock c the table on the page will then express the series of and their results if now only those struck or pointed at by the clock a be to and written down it will be found that they produce the series of the squares of the natural numbers such a series could of course be carried by this only so far as the numbers which can be by three but this may be to give some idea of the was in fact the point to which the first model of the engine now in we have seen then that the effect of the of labour both in and in mental is that it enables us to and apply to each process that of skill and which is for it we avoid any part of the time of a man who can get eight or ten a day by his skill in needles in turning a wheel which can be done for a day; and we equally avoid the loss arising from the of an in the lowest of the of labour cannot be unless there exists a great demand for its and it a large capital to be in those arts in which it is used in it has been

of each process in a the great by and the of the of the of labour render it for each to be on the watch to methods by which the cost of the article he may be and with this view it is of great to know the precise expense of every process as well as of the wear and tear of which is due to it the same is for those by whom the goods are and sold; because it enables them to give answers or to the of and also affords them a better chance of to the changes in the fashion of his goods which may be either to the tastes or to the of his to the such is still more for without it he must trust to others and can form no worthy of of the effect any tax may produce or of the injury the or the country may suffer by its one of the first which itself as likely to arise from a correct of the expense of the several of any is the which it would furnish of the course in which should be if a method could be of by one fourth the time for fixing on the heads of pins the expense of making them would be reduced about per cent; whilst a of one half the time in the coil of wire out of which the heads are cut would make any in the cost of of the whole article it is obvious that the would be much more to the former than the latter process the expense of in a country where is of the rudest kind and manual labour is very cheap is in the price of cotton cloth in the island of java the cotton in the seed is sold by the picul which is a weight of about lbs not above one fourth or one fifth of this weight however is cotton the natives by means of rude wooden rollers can only about lb of cotton from the seed by one day's labour a picul of cotton is worth between four and five times the cost of the impure and the prices of the same in its stages of arefor one picul dollars cotton in the seed to clean cotton to cotton thread cotton thread dyed blue good cotton cloth thus it appears that the expense of in java is per cent on the value of the raw the expense of dying thread blue is per cent on its value; and that of weaving cotton thread into cloth per cent on its value the expense of cotton into a fine thread is in england about per cent as an example of the cost of the of a perhaps an of the expense of the volume now in the hands may not be more as it will afford an insight into the nature and extent of the taxes upon it is found to print it upon paper of a very large size so that pages

charges for by the sheet the type to be all of one kind; and as this charge is by the size of the letter on which the in a sheet depends little dispute can arise after the price is agreed upon if there are but few or other parts of the work which require to be printed in smaller type; or if there are many notes or several in greek or in other a type these are in the and a small price per sheet allowed if there is a large portion of small type it is better to have a charge for it per sheet if any work with lines and many figures and what the call rules occurs it is called table work and is charged at an price per sheet of this are in the present volume if the page of figures as in tables which require very careful the charge for is usually doubled a few years ago i printed a table of on a page which great labour and care from the readers in the proofs correct and for which new punches were not several new types were and for which plates were cast costing about l per sheet in this case l per sheet were charged with the same sized letter in demy octavo could have been at per sheet but as the expense was before the work it gave rise to no the charge for and is one which from the of them gives rise to the and is as to the if he be the agent between the author and the printer and to the master printer or his foreman as it is to the author himself if the author study economy he should make the whole of his in the and should copy it out fairly it will then be printed and he will have little to pay for but it is to judge of the effect of any passage without having it set up in type; and there are few upon which an author does not find he can add some details or when he sees his views in print if he wish to save his own labour in and to give the last polish to the he must be content to these objects at an expense if the printer possess a stock of type it will still more to the of the author to have his whole work put up in what are called slips and then to make all the and to have as few revises as he can the present work was set up in slips but the have been large and the revises the press work or off is charged at a price agreed upon for each two hundred and fifty sheets; and any broken number is still as two hundred and fifty when a large edition is the price for two hundred and fifty is thus in the present volume two hundred and fifty copies if printed alone would have been charged eleven per sheet instead of s d the actual charge the of this mode of is good as it all but it is to be that the custom of the same price for any small number as for two hundred and fifty is so adhered to that the workmen will not agree to any other terms when only twenty or thirty copies are or even when only three or four are wanted for the sake of some perhaps if all numbers above fifty were charged as two hundred and fifty and all below as for half two hundred and fifty both parties would derive an the effect of the excise duty is to render the paper thin in order that it may weigh little; but this is by the desire of the author to make his book look as thick as in order that he may charge the public as much as he can; and so on that ground alone the duty is of no there is however another effect of this duty which both the public and the author feel; for they pay not merely the duty which is charged but also the profit on that duty which the for the use of and also the profit to the and on the price of the volume the charge for is in the present case about the usual for such a volume; and as it is that in are the most where the pays a duty of s d nearly one half of the charge of is a tax it appears then that to an of l to produce the present volume l are added in the shape of a direct tax whether the profits arising from such a mode of will justify such a rate of can only be when the returns from the volume are a subject that will be in a chapter it is at present to observe that the tax on is an tax when with that upon paper and on other the object of all is by making known for sale to procure for them a better price if the sale is to be by or a larger extent of sale if by retail dealers now the more any article is known the more quickly it is whether it to the comfort or of the public; and the more quickly its is assured if it be found it would appear then that every tax on which are the of in another shape is one which must reduce the amount that would have been raised had no been placed in the way of making known to the public their and their price notes these facts are taken from indian these charges refer to the

in it and also that the time in the several is very in order however to render more simple the which follows it will be to suppose that each of the seven there an equal of time this being it is at once that to conduct an for most the number of persons must be a of ten for if a person with small means has only capital to enable him to employ half that number of persons they cannot each of them adhere to the of the same and if a employs any number not a of ten a similar result must ensue with respect to some portion of them the same itself on any factory in that of mr mordan the of the pencils one room is devoted to some of the by which steel pens are six are here at work; in the first a sheet of thin steel is brought by the workman under the die which at each blow cuts out a flat piece of the metal having the form for the pen two other workmen are in placing these flat pieces under two other presses in which a steel chisel cuts the slit three other workmen occupy other presses in which the pieces so receive their form the longer time for the small pieces in the two latter renders them less rapid in than the first; so that two workmen are fully in and three in bending the flat pieces which one man can punch out of the sheet of steel if it were to enlarge this factory it is clear that twelve or presses would be worked with more economy than any number not a of six the same extends to every which is upon the of the of labour and we arrive at this general when the number of into which it is most to divide it and the number of to be in it are then all which do not employ a direct of this latter number will produce the article at a greater cost this ought always to be kept in view in great it is quite even with the best of the labour to attend to it rigidly in the number of the persons who possess the skill is of course to be first to that exact ratio which is more for a factory a hundred workmen may not be quite the best where there are five and the of both may admit of without the cost of their produce but it is quite certain that no nor in the case of could any five ever hope to compete with an hence arises one cause of the great size of which have with the of other however to the same end and arise also from the same cause the of labour the out of which the article is must in the several stages of its be from one to the next in this can be done at least expense when they are all working in the same if the weight of the is this reason acts with force; but even where it is light the danger arising from removal may render it to have all the carried on in the same in the cutting and of glass this is the case; whilst in the art of several of the are carried on in the of the workmen it is however clear that the latter plan which is with some to the family of the workmen can be adopted only where there exists a sure and quick method of knowing that the work has been well done and that the whole of the given out have been really the to for any process of with the demand for the and the of on the other hand tends to the and to lead to the of large an of these may be found in the history of the of patent net the first for weaving this article were very costing from a to twelve or hundred pounds the of one of these though it greatly the he could produce was unable when working eight hours a day to compete with the old methods this arose from the large capital in the but he quickly that with the same expense of fixed capital and a small to his capital he could work the machine during the whole hours the profits thus soon induced other persons to direct their to the of those and the price was greatly reduced at the same time that the of of the patent net was but if be kept working through the hours it is that some person shall attend to admit the workmen at the time they relieve each other; and whether the porter or other servant so admit one person or twenty his rest will be equally it will also be to adjust or repair the and this can be done much better by a workman to than by the person who uses it now since the good and the of depend to a very great extent upon every shake or in their parts as soon as they appear the prompt of a workman on the spot will reduce the arising from the wear and tear of the but in the case of single lace frame or a single loom this would be too a plan here then arises another which tends to enlarge the extent of a factory it ought to consist of such a number of as shall occupy the whole time of one workman in keeping them in order if beyond that number the same of economy would point out the of or the number of in order to employ the whole time of two or three skilful workmen where one portion of the labour in the of mere force as in weaving and in many similar arts it will soon occur to the that if that part were by a the same man might in the case of weaving attend to two or more looms at once; and since we already suppose that one or more have been the number of his looms may be so that their time shall be fully in keeping the and the looms in order one of the first results will be that the looms can be driven by the engine nearly twice as fast as before and as each man when from bodily labour can attend to two looms one workman can now make almost as much cloth as four this of power is however greater than that which really took place at first; the of some of the parts of the loom being limited by the of the thread and the with which it its motion but an was soon made by which the motion slowly and greater than it was safe to give it at once; and the speed was thus from to about strokes per minute the same the becomes so that the expense of during the night amounts to a sum; and as there are already to the persons who are up all night and can attend to it and also to make and keep in repair any the of an for making gas to light the factory leads to a new at the same time that it by the expense of and the risk of from fire to reduce the cost of long before a factory has reached this extent it will have been found to an with clerks to pay the workmen and to see that they arrive at their stated times; and this must be in with the agents who the raw produce and with those who sell the article we have seen that the of the of labour tends to produce cheaper that it thus the demand; and by the effect of or by the hope of gain that it causes large to be in let us now examine the of this of capital to one object in the first place it enables the most on which the of the of labour depends to be carried almost to its extreme limits not merely is the precise amount of skill which is for the of each process but every that in which the raw is to that by which the produce is into the hands of the same economy of skill the of work by a given number of people is greatly by such an and the result is a great in the cost of the article which is brought to market amongst the causes which tend to the cheap of any article and which are with the of capital may be the care which is taken to prevent the waste of any part of the raw an to this causes the union of two trades in one factory which might have been an of the arts to which the horns of cattle are will furnish a example of this kind of economy the tanner who has the raw hides the horns and sells them to the makers of combs and the horn of two parts an outward horny case and an inward conical between hair and bone the first process in these two parts by means of a blow against a block of wood the horny is then cut into three with a the lowest of these next the root of the horn after several by which it is is made into combs the middle of the horn after being by heat and having its by oil is split into thin layers and forms a for glass in of the kind the tip of the horn is used by the makers of knife handles and of the tops of whips and for other similar the or core of the horn is boiled down in water a large of fat rises to the this is put aside and sold to the makers of yellow soap the liquid itself is used as a kind of glue and is by cloth for the which remains behind is then sent to the mill and being ground down is sold to the farmers for manure besides these various to which the parts of the horn are applied the which arise in comb making are sold to the farmer for manure in the first year after they are spread over the soil they have little effect but during the next four or five their is the which form the refuse of the lantern maker are of a much thinner texture some of them are cut into various figures and painted and used as toys; for being they curl up when placed on the palm of a warm hand but the greater part of these also are sold for manure and from their thin and divided form the full effect is upon the first crop another event which has arisen in one trade at least from the of large capital is that a class of between the maker and the now no longer exist when calico was woven in the of the workmen there existed a class of persons who about and the pieces so made in large numbers for the purpose of selling them to the but the were obliged to examine every piece in order to know that it was perfect and of full measure the greater number of the workmen it is true might be upon but the fraud of a few would render this for any single though by one might still hope that the fact would not become known to all the rest the value of though great in all of life can never be so fully by persons of small capital as by those much larger sums whilst these larger sums of money for which the deals render his for more studied and known by others thus it happens that high the place of an portion of and the in dealing with the great is saved from the expense of by knowing that the loss or even the of the would be with greater injury to himself than any profit upon a single could the amount of which exists in the of its and is one of the many that an old country always over its rivals to such an extent is this

affords them fuel and power are the for them; and any fall of water in the will be to for aid in the coarser of force; for the ore for blowing the or for and rolling out the iron there are indeed

also to observe that the effect of driving any into a new where similar works have not existed is not merely to place it out of the reach of such but after a few years the example of its success will most induce other in the new to engage in the same and thus one only should be driven away the workmen through whose its removal is will not merely suffer by the loss of that portion of demand for their labour which the factory caused; but the value of that labour will itself be reduced by the of a new field of another which has its on this is the nature of the heavy such as etc cannot readily be moved and must always be taken to pieces for that but when the of a factory of a of engines each in itself and all put in motion by one source of power such as that of steam then the removal is much less thus frames lace and looms can be to more with but a small of their parts it is of great that the more amongst the class of workmen should examine into the of these views; because without having their to them the whole class may in some be led by persons to pursue a course which in is in reality at with their own best i confess i am not without a hope that this volume may fall into the hands of workmen perhaps better than myself to reason upon a subject which only plain common sense and whose powers are by its to their in asking their to the remarks and to those which i shall offer i can claim only one over them; namely that i never have had and in all human never shall have the to even or by the i have formed on the facts which have come before me notes the amount of arising

against the snags the water may not rest of the vessel and sink it chapter on over one of the natural and almost of is the of a supply much larger than the demand this result usually arises and it is equally both to the masters and to the workmen to prevent its or to foresee its arrival in where a great number of very small each master works himself and is by his own family or by a few where a variety of is a curious system of has arisen which in some measure the extent to which of wages would reach this is by a species of or factors persons some capital who the price of any of the in which they deal is greatly reduced it on their own account in the hopes of selling at a profit when the market is better these persons in times act as or agents and make up of goods at the market price for the use of the home or foreign dealer they possess large in which to make up their orders or keep in store during periods of thus acting as a kind of in the market price the effect of upon great is when an over supply has reduced prices one of two events usually occurs the first is a payment for labour; the other is a of the number of hours during which the work with a rate of wages in the former case to go on at its rate in the latter the itself being checked the supply again adjusts itself to the demand as soon as the stock on hand is worked off and prices then regain their former level the latter course appears in the first to be the best both for masters and men; but there seems to be a in this except where the trade is in few hands in fact it is almost for its success that there should be a amongst the masters or amongst the men; or what is always far to either a mutual for their joint amongst the men is and is always with the evils which arise from the illwill excited against any persons who in the of their are not to act with the the of the masters on the other hand is unless the whole body of them agree for if any one master can procure more labour for his money than the rest he will be able to them if we look only at the of the the case is when too large a supply has a great of price it opens the of the article to a new class and the of those who it it is against the of both these parties that a return to the former price should occur it is also certain that by the of profit which the suffers from the price his will be that he will apply himself to other and cheaper sources for the supply of his raw that he will to which shall it at a cheaper rate; or try to new into his factory which shall render the economy of it more perfect in the event of his success by any of these courses or by their joint effects a real and good will be a larger portion of the public will receive from the use of the article and they will procure it at a lower price; and the though his profit on each is reduced will yet by the more returns on the larger produce of his factory find his real gain at the end of the year nearly the same as it was before; whilst the wages of the workman will return to their level and both the and the workman will find the demand less from its being on a larger number of it would be highly if we could trace even through the history of any great the effects of gluts in in or in methods of and if we could shew what to the annual of goods was by each it would be found that the by the same capital when worked with the new would produce nearly the same rate of profit as other modes of perhaps the of iron would furnish the best of this because by having the actual price of pig and bar iron at the same place and at the same time the effect of a change in the value of as well as several other sources of would be removed at the present moment whilst the of iron are of the low price of their produce a new mode of iron is coming into use which if it the of the to reduce greatly the cost of the in heating the air to it for blowing the furnace one of the results is that coal may be used instead of coke; and this in its turn the of which is for the fusion of the iron stone the by the of the patent is from journal p view of the of at the clyde iron works to smelt a ton of foundry pigiron and of the of foundry

per square inch there are two tuyeres to each furnace the muzzles of the are inches in the air heated to upwards of degrees of it will melt lead at the of three inches from the orifice through which it issues from the pipe the effect by thus heating the air is by no means an obvious result; and an of its action will lead to some curious views the future of for blowing every cubic foot of air driven into a furnace of two gases about being oxygen and azote to the present state of the oxygen alone is in heat; and the of blowing a furnace may be thus the air is forced into the furnace in a state and heat from the bodies being itself of it would even without still require heat to raise it to the of the hot to which it is to be applied on coming into contact with the ignited in the furnace the oxygen unites with them parting at the same moment with a large portion of its latent heat and forming which have less heat than their some of these pass up the chimney in a gaseous state whilst others remain in the form of melted slags on the surface of the iron which is fused by the heat thus set at liberty the effects of the azote are similar to the first and second of those above it seems to form no and nothing in any stage to augment the heat the plan of heating the air before driving it into the furnace saves the whole of that heat which the fuel must have in raising it from the of the air up to that of degrees thus the fire more intense and the glassy slags more fusible and perhaps also more the iron ore the same of fuel applied at once to the furnace would only prolong the of its heat not augment its the of so large a portion of the air driven into being not merely useless but acting really as a cooling instead of a heating cause added to so great a waste of power

should prove for their object the great appears to be to the oxygen which aids from the azote which impedes it if either of those gases becomes liquid at a lower than the other and if those are within the limits of our present powers of the object might be let us assume for example that oxygen becomes liquid under a of whilst azote a of then if air be to the two part of its bulk the oxygen will be found in a liquid state at the bottom of the vessel in which the is and the upper part of the vessel will contain only azote in the state of gas the oxygen now may be drawn off for the supply of the but as it ought when used to have a very degree of its force may be in working a small engine the azote also in the upper part of the vessel though useless for may be as a source of power and by its work another engine by these means the force exerted in the would all be except that small part for forcing the pure oxygen into the furnace and the much larger part lost in the of the the to be in these is that of packing a working piston so as to bear the of or but this does not seem it is also that the of the two gases which common air may be by such if this should be the case it might offer a new mode of nitrous or nitric acids the result of such might take another if the were over liquids it is that they might enter into new thus if air were highly in a vessel water the latter might unite with an dose of oxygen which might be easily for the use of the furnace a further cause of the of the results of such an arises from the that azote may really to the fusion of the mixed mass in the furnace though its mode of is at present unknown an of the nature of the gases issuing from the of might perhaps assist in up this point; and in fact if such were also upon the various of all we might expect the of many points in the economy of the art it is very also that the action of oxygen in a liquid state might be and that the vessels must be lined with or some other of very and most new and would be formed at such in some made by count rumford in on the force of fired he noticed a solid which always in the when the ignited powder had no means of and in those cases the gas which escaped on the was usually if the gases are used the form of the iron furnace must be changed and perhaps it may be to direct the flame from the ignited fuel upon the ore to be fused instead of mixing that ore with the fuel itself by a proper of the blast an or a flame might be and from the of the flame with its agency we might expect the most ore to be smelted and that the metals at present almost such as and others might be brought into common use and thus effect a in the arts on the of a glut that new and cheaper modes of are not and that the to exceed the demand then it is that too much capital is in the trade; and after a time the rate of profit will drive some of the to other what will leave it must depend on a variety of and will enable some to make a profit rather beyond the rest; capital in others will enable them without these to support longer even at a loss with the hope of driving the smaller out of the market and then by an price it is however better for all parties that this contest should not last long; and it is that no should to prevent it an of such and of its effect occurs at the port of where a act of that every ship shall be loaded in its turn the of the house of commons in their report on the coal trade state that 'under the in this act if more ships enter into the trade than can be in it the loss by in port and waiting for a cargo which must take place instead of falling as it would upon ships and forcing them from the trade is now divided evenly amongst them; and the loss thus created is shared by the whole number' report p it is not in this short view to trace out all the effects or of the subject is and unlike some of the already treated a view of the of many causes notes the average price per ton of pig iron bar iron and coal with the

more heat with the same of fuel of the water of thenard chapter to any there are many which ought always to be made to the of the of any new article these chiefly relate to the expense of tools raw and all the for its to the extent of demand which is likely to arise; to the time in which the capital will be and to the or with which the new article will those already in use the expense of tools and of new will be more to in as they differ from those already but the variety in use in our various is such that few now occur in which may not be traced to others already the cost of the raw is usually less to but cases arise in which it becomes to examine whether the supply at the given price can be upon for in the case of a small the demand arising from a factory may produce a rise though it may reduce the price the of any new article likely to be is a most subject for the of the of a new as these pages are not for the of the but rather for the purpose of giving a general view of the subject an of the way in which such are by men will perhaps be most the extract from the given before a of the house of commons in the report on and shews the extent to which the most are and the view which the takes of them the person on this was mr ostler a of glass beads and other toys of the same from several of the made by him were placed upon the table for the of the of the house of commons which held its in one of the is there any thing else you have to state upon this answer may the on the table as but perhaps i may them a little by the fact years ago on my first journey to london a man in the city asked me if i could supply him with dolls' eyes; and i was foolish enough to feel half i thought it to my new dignity as a to make dolls' eyes he took me into a room quite as wide and perhaps twice the length of this and we had just room to walk between stacks from the loor to the ceiling of parts of dolls he said 'these are only the legs and arms; the trunks are below but i saw enough to me that he wanted a great many eyes; and as the article quite in my own line of i said i would take an order by way of and he shewed me several i copied the order he ordered various and of various sizes and on to the hotel i found that the order to upwards of l i went into the country and to make them i had some of the most glass in the kingdom in my but when i shewed it to them they shook their heads and said they had often seen the article before but could not make it i engaged them by to use their best but after trying and wasting a great deal of time for three or four weeks i was obliged to the attempt soon i engaged in another branch of and took no more notice of it about months ago i resumed the trinket trade and then to think of the dolls' eyes; and about eight months since i met with a poor fellow who had himself by and who was dying in a in a state of great want i showed him ten and he said he would me in the process he was in such a state that he could not bear the of his own lamp but though i was very with the manual part of the and it related to things i was daily in the habit of seeing i felt i could do nothing from his i mention this to show how it is to convey by the mode of working he took me into his garret where the poor fellow had to such a degree that he used the and fat of poultry from market to save oil the price of the article having been lately so much reduced by at home in an instant before i had seen him make three i felt to make a gross; and the between his mode and that of my own workmen was so that i felt the utmost you can now make dolls' eyes? answer i can as it was years ago that i the order i have and feeling of my own though very strong and that it could not have been to the amount stated i last night took the present very reduced price of that article less than half now of what it was then and that every child in this country not using a doll till two years old and it aside at seven and having a new one i myself that the eyes alone would produce a of a great many pounds i mention this merely to shew the of and to assign one reason amongst many for my that nothing but can enable our to be in many it is to the sale of an article or the effects of a a case however during a recent enquiry which not quite as an of demand is highly as to the mode of of this nature a of the house of commons was to enquire into the tolls proper to be placed on a of and upon which widely had been formed if we may judge by the very rate of tolls imposed upon such by trusts' the on which the the enquiry were that 'the only ground on which a fair claim to toll can be made on any public road is to raise a fund which with the economy shall be just to repay the expense of its to it in good and repair' they first to from persons the effect of the alone in a road the next step was to the in which the road was injured by the effect of the horses' feet with that of the wheels mr the under mr telford of the roads was and to the injury from the of iron worn off from the shoes of the horses and from the tire of the wheels from the data he the of iron for the tire of the wheels and for the shoes of the horses of one of

rate of ten miles an hour and the same amount of injury to occur on another road used only by waggons moving at the rate of three miles an hour mr divides the in the arising from; fast coach; heavy

present one a new lock however secure and however cheap would not so readily make its way if less than the old it would be in new work but old locks would rarely be removed to make way for it; and even if secure its advance would be slow another element in this which should not be omitted is the which the new may create by its real or injury to other and the effect of that this is not always and when is often on the first of from london to margate the of the coaches running on that line of road the house of commons against them as likely to lead to the ruin of the coach it was however found that the fear was and in a very few years the number of coaches on that road was through the very means which were thought to be adverse to it the fear which is now that and may drive out of a large of the horses at present in use is not less on some lines such an effect might be but in all the number of horses in goods and to the great lines of would exceed that which is at present used notes one of the results of these is that every coach which travels from london to about eleven pounds of wrought iron along with the line of road between the two places chapter on a new system of a most and opinion amongst workmen in many that their own and that of their are at the are that is and even new by the masters do not receive a fair that the talents and of the workmen are not to the of the in which they are this error is perhaps most where the of has been of recent origin and where the number of persons in them is not very large thus in some of the on the rhine it to a much greater extent than in perhaps its in our own arises partly from the spread amongst the and partly from the example of persons who by good conduct and an to the of their for a series of years have become foremen or who have been into as i am from my own that the and success of the master is to the welfare of the workman i am yet to admit that this is in many cases too remote to be always by the latter and whilst it is true that workmen as a class derive from the of their i do not think that each of that exactly in to the extent to which he towards it; nor do i that the is as as it might become under a system it would be of great if in every large the mode of payment could be so that every person should derive from the success of the whole; and that the profits of each should advance as the factory itself profit without the of making any change in the wages this is by no means easy to effect amongst that class whose daily labour for them their daily food the system which has long been pursued in working the cornish mines not exactly these yet which make it worthy of as having nearly towards them and as tending to render fully the of all who are engaged in it i am the more induced to place before the reader a short sketch of this system because its to that which i shall for trial will perhaps remove some to the latter and may also furnish some hints for any which might be in the mines of almost the whole of the both above and below ground are for the manner of making the is nearly as follows at the end of every two months the work which it is to carry on during the next period is marked out it is of three kinds tutwork which in sinking shafts driving levels and making this is paid for by the fathom in depth or in length or by the cubic fathom tribute which is payment for raising and the ore by means of a certain part of its value when it is this mode of payment which such effects the miners who are to be paid in to the of the vein and the of metal from it become in the of ore and in its value; and it is their to avail of every that can bring it more cheaply to market the who dig and dress the ore can seldom afford to dress the coarser parts of what they raise at their price; this portion is again let out to other persons who agree to dress it at an price the lots of ore to be dressed and the works to be carried on having been marked out some days before and having been by the men a kind of auction is held by the of the mine in which each lot is put up and bid for by gangs of men the work is then offered at a price usually below that bid at the auction to the lowest bidder who rarely it at the rate the tribute is a certain sum out of every twenty worth of ore raised and may vary from to or fifteen the rate of in tribute is very if a vein which was poor when taken becomes rich the men earn money and have in which each miner of a gang has gained a hundred pounds in the two months these cases are perhaps of more to the owners of the mine than even to the men; for whilst the skill and of the workmen are greatly the owner himself always derives still greater from the of the vein this system has been by mr taylor into the lead mines of into those at skipton in and into some of the copper mines of and it is that it should become general because no other mode of payment affords to the workmen a measure of success so to the the and the talent which they exert i shall now present the outline of a system which appears to me to be with the most results both to the class of workmen and to the country at large; and which if acted upon would in my opinion raise the working classes and greatly extend the system the general on which the system is founded are that a part of the wages by each person should depend on the profits made by the and that every person with it should derive more from any he might to the factory in which he is than he could by any other course it would be to prevail on the large to enter upon any system which would change the of the profits arising from the of his capital in setting skill and labour in action; any must be rather from the small or from the higher class of workmen who combine the two and to these latter classes whose welfare will be first the change is most i shall first point out the course to be pursued in making the and then taking a branch of trade as an i shall examine the merits and defects of the system as applied to it let us suppose in some large town ten or twelve of the most and skilful workmen to unite whose for and are good and are well known among their own class such persons will each possess some small portion of and let them join with one or two others who have raised into the class of small master and possess rather a larger portion of capital let these persons after well the subject agree to a of and and let us suppose that each of the ten workmen can command forty pounds and each of the small two hundred pounds thus they have a capital of l with which to and for the sake of let us further suppose the labour of each of these twelve persons to be worth two pounds a week one portion of their capital will be in the tools for their trade which we shall take at l and this must be as their fixed capital the l must be as capital in the iron with which their are made in paying the rent of their and in and their until some portion of it is by the sale of the goods now the first to be settled is what of the profit should be allowed for the use of capital and what for skill and labour? it does not seem to decide this by any if the capital by each partner is equal all will be if the must be left to find its level and will be by and it is that it will not much let us suppose it to be agreed that the capital of l shall receive the wages of one workman at the end of each week every workman is to receive one pound as wages and one pound is to be divided amongst the owners of the capital after a few weeks the returns will begin to come in; and they will soon become nearly uniform should be kept of every expense and of all the sales; and at the end of each week the profit should be divided a certain portion should be laid aside as a fund another portion for repair of the tools and the being divided into parts one of these parts would be divided amongst the and one belong to each workman thus each man would in make up his usual wages of two pounds weekly if the factory went on the wages of the men would if the sales fell off they would be it is that every person in the might be the amount paid for his whether he act as or porter as the clerk who keeps the or as for a few hours once a week to them should receive one half of what his service is worth in fixed salary the other part varying with the success of the in such a factory of course of labour would be some of the workmen would be in forging the others in them others in and forming the fenders it would be that the time in each process and also its expense should be well which would soon be very now if a workman should find a mode of any of the he would confer a benefit on the whole party even if they but a small part of the profit for the of such it would be that those who make them should either receive some reward to be after a trial by a or if they be of high that the should receive onehalf or of the profit from them during the next year or some other period as might be found as the of such would be clear gain to the factory it is obvious that such a share might be allowed to the that it would be for his rather to give the benefit of them to his than to dispose of them in any other way the result of such in a factory would be that every person engaged in it would have a direct in its since the effect of any success or falling off would almost produce a change in his own weekly every person in the factory would have an in any waste or in all the the talents of all with it would be to its in every none but workmen of high and could obtain into such because when any hands were it would be the common of all to admit only the most and and it would be far less easy to impose upon a dozen workmen than upon the single of a factory when any a glut in the market more skill would be to the cost of and a portion of the time of the men might then be in and their tools for which a fund would pay thus present and at the same time future another of no small would be the total removal of all real or causes for the workmen and the would so shade into each other would so have a common and their and would be so well that instead of to oppress one another the only which could exist would be a most union between both parties to their common one of the such a system is that would at first fear to embark in it that the workmen would receive too large a share of the profits and it is quite true that the workmen would have a larger share than at present but at the same time it is the effect of the whole system would be that the total profits of the being much the smaller allowed to capital under this system would yet be greater in actual amount than that which results to it from the larger share in the system now it is that the present laws to might with so if this could not be by their under the system to ready money it would be to what changes in the law would be to its and this another reason for into the of limited a would occur also in workmen who behaved ill or who were not to their work; this would arise from their having a certain in the fund and perhaps from their a certain portion of the capital but without into detail it may be that such cases might be on by of the whole and that if the policy of the laws such it would be more to enforce just than it now is to enforce some which are unjust by means of either amongst the masters or the men some to this system is already in several trades the mode of the cornish mines has already been alluded to; the payment to the crew of whaling ships is by this the profits arising from fishing with nets on the south coast of england are thus divided onehalf the produce belongs to the owner of the boat and net; the other half is divided in equal between the persons using it who are also bound to assist in the net when injured notes for a account of the method of working the cornish mines see a paper of mr john of the society vol ii p chapter on the power of and of does not appear if we may judge from the of its to be a or a rare gift of the vast of which have been almost daily for a series of years a large part has failed from the nature of the first trials; whilst a still larger portion which had escaped the failed only because the economy of their was not to the to examine into the methods for the forgery of state in their report

single part of it has been in fact all the and all the ought first to be in the on the other hand there are effects upon or for the of which no will be of any use these are the objects of direct trial for if the result of an engine is to be that it shall impress letters on a by means of steel punches forced into it all the by which the punches and the copper are to be moved at stated and brought into contact is within the of drawing and the may be upon paper but a doubt may spring up whether the bur that will be raised round the letter which has been already punched upon the copper may not with the proper action of the punch for the letter which is to be punched next to it it may also be feared that the effect of the second letter if it be near to the first may distort the form of that first figure if neither of these evils should arise still the bur by the might be to with the of the by the and the plate itself after having all but its edge covered with figures might change its form from the unequal which it must suffer in this process so as to render it very to take from it at all it is by any to solve such as these alone can their effect such having been made it is found that if the sides of the steel punch are nearly at right angles to the face of the letter the bur is very that at the depth which is for no of the letters takes place those letters are placed very close to each other; that the small bur which arises may easily be scraped off; and that the is not by the of the metal in but is fit to print from after it has that process the next stage in the of an after the are and the have been made if any such should be is the of the machine itself it can never be too upon the minds of those who are new that to make the most perfect of every part tends both to the success of the trial and to economy in at the result the actual from working is an easy task; always that good tools are and that methods of working are adopted in which the of the part depends less on the skill of the workman than upon the of the method the causes of failure in this stage most derive their origin from errors in the one; and it is merely to a few of their sources they arise from having to take into that metals are not rigid but elastic a steel of small must not be as an rod; but in order to ensure its perfect action as an axis it must be at proper again the

axes which drive the from being impeded by the that would arise from the in any of the in upon it is quite a mistake to suppose that any work is good enough for such a purpose if the is worth making it ought to be tried with all the of which the state of art admits; for an trial may cause an idea to be given up which better might have proved to be on the other hand when once the of a has been with good it will be easy to the degree of which will suffice for its due action it is partly owing to the of the trials and partly to the gradual in the art of making that many which have been tried and given up in one state of art have at another period been the idea of by means of types had itself to the of many persons with taken either from blocks or seals we find amongst the in the remains of pompeii and stamps for words formed out of one piece of metal and several letters the idea of these letters and of them into other words for the purpose of a book could have failed to occur to many but it would almost have been by those best with the arts of that time; for the workmen of those days must have the of many pieces of wood or metal fitting so and ranging so as the types or blocks of wood now used in the art of the of the press which bears the name of bramah was known about a century and a half before the machine to which it gave rise but the state of art in the time of the would have him if the of it had to his mind from to employ it in as an for force these prove the of at the of during which the art of making has any great the trails of methods which founded upon just had failed when the of a machine have been made and the parts have been well and even when the work it all the which were still the may fail; that is it may fail of being brought into general this will most arise from the of its its work at a greater expense than that at which it can be made by other methods the new or machine is to become the basis of a it is that the whole expense its should be fully before its is it is almost always very to make this of the expense the more the the less easy is the task; and in cases of great and extent of it is almost it has been roughly that the first of any newly machine will cost about five times as much as the of the second an which is perhaps near the truth if the second machine is to be like the first the same and the same will answer for it; but if as usually happens some have been by the of the first these must be more or less altered when however two or three have been and many more are wanted they can usually be at much less than of the expense of the the arts of of drawing and of do not usually reside in their in one and in this as in other arts the of labour must be applied the best advice which can be offered to a of any is to employ a who if he has had a large in his will assist in finding out whether the is new and can then make working of it the first step however the whether the has the merit of novelty is most for it is a maxim equally just in all the arts and in every science that the man who aspires to fortune or to fame by new must be content to examine with care the of his or to exhaust his efforts in again what he will most find has been better before this is a subject upon which even men are often there is perhaps no trade or in which there is so much so much of the and of the history of their own art with respect to its and extent as are to be met with amongst the dazzled with the beauty of some perhaps really assumes his new with as little that that thought and painful labour are to its as does the or the senator much of this false arises from the which is of the of in it is of great to the and to the of those who are too often led away from more the dupes of their own and of the popular voice to both them and the public that the power of making new is a common to a of minds and that the talents which it are by no means of the highest order it is still more that they should be with the that the great merit and the great success of those who have to in such matters was almost due to the with which they upon their the skill and which years of study had matured chapter proper for the of the first object of the chief cause of its utility is the and the cheap of the which it is to make it is to produce a great of things all of exactly the same kind the proper time has arrived for the of tools or by which they may be if only a few pairs of cotton should be it would be an absurd waste of time and of capital to a to weave them when for a few pence four steel wires can be by which they may be knit if on the other hand many pairs were wanted the time and the expense in a would be more than repaid by the saving of time in making that large number of the same is to the copying of letters if three or four copies only are the pen and the human hand furnish the means of them; if are called for may be brought to our but if of are wanted the of a the most method of the object there are however many cases in which or tools must be made in which is not the most object it is to produce a few parts of for which must be with the most rigid or be alikeit is nearly to fulfil this even with the aid of the most skilful hands and it becomes to make tools for the purpose those tools should as happens cost more in than the things they are to make another of the just of even at an expense arises where the of time in which the article is has an on its value in the of our daily it happens that the debates in the houses of are carried on to three and four o'clock in the morning that is to within a very few hours of the time for the of the paper the must be taken down by by them to the of the perhaps at the of one or two miles by them in the office set up by the the press and the paper be printed off and before the public can read them some of these have a of from five to ten daily four to be wanted and that they could be printed only at the rate of five hundred per hour upon one side of the paper which was the number two and a boy could take off by the old hand presses sixteen hours would be for the and the news to the of the latest portion of the would be out of date before they could receive it to obviate this it was often to set up the paper in and when late in but the in the have been so great that four copies are now printed on one side in an hour the of 'the times' is an example on a large scale of a in which the of labour both mental and bodily is and in which also the effect of economy is well it is by the who read that paper in various of the globe what a scene of the factory during the whole night or what a of talent and skill is put in action for their and nearly a hundred persons are in this and during the session of at least twelve are the houses of commons and lords; each in his turn after about an hour's work to into writing the speech he has just heard and noted in in the fifty are at work some of whom have already set up the whilst others are to type the yet undried of the of a speech whose middle portion is to the office in the pocket of the hasty and whose is perhaps at that very moment making the walls of st vibrate with the of its hearers these types as fast as they are are passed in to other hands; till at last the of the debate forming when united with the matter columns in regular order on the of the the hand

great rollers which seem to devour them with unsated other rollers convey them to the type already inked and having brought them into rapid and contact them to four other printed by the almost touch thus in one hour four sheets of paper are printed on one side; and an of twelve copies from above three hundred pieces of metal is for the public in six hours the effect of in other and of due economy in them is so for the of that it is worth by what means it is to produce them at the small price at which they are sold which is at and sold at three a number will furnish an example soon after its in the sale in reached and in order to supply the demand in london it was but on account of the expense of it was found that this plan would not produce any profit and the london edition was about to be given up when it to the to it at and cast two copies of the plates this is now done about three weeks before the day of set of plates being sent up to london by the mail an is printed off by steam the london agent has then time to send by the to several of the large towns and other copies go through the parcels to all the smaller towns thus a great saving is in the outlay of capital and copies are from london as a centre to all parts of england whilst there is no in sets nor any waste from more than the public demand the of letters is another case in which the of saving time would allow of great expense in any new for its there is a natural limit to the speed of horses which even the in the breed aided by an in our roads can never and from which perhaps we are at present not very remote when we reflect upon the great expense of time and money which the last of a theory or an art usually require it is not to suppose that the period has arrived in which the of for such ought to be tried the post bag every evening by the mail to one of our largest cities bristol usually weighs less than a hundred pounds now the first which itself is that in order to these letters a hundred and twenty miles a coach and above thirty are put in motion and also over the same space it is obvious that amongst the of for such an object it would be to reduce the weight of matter to be along with the letters it would also be to reduce the of the animal power because the faster a horse is driven the less weight he can draw amongst the variety of which might be for this purpose we will mention one which by no means free from fulfils some of the and it is not a purely since some few have been made upon it though on an limited scale let us imagine a series of high pillars erected at perhaps every hundred feet and as nearly as in a line between two post towns an iron or steel wire must be over proper fixed on each of these pillars and at the end of every three or five miles as may be found in a very strong support by which it may be at each of these latter points a man ought to reside in a small a narrow tin case to contain the letters might be by two wheels rolling upon this wire; the cases being so as to enable the wheels to pass by the fixed of the wire an endless wire of much smaller size must pass over two drums one at each end of the station this wire should be on rollers fixed to the of the great wire and at a short below it there would thus be two of the smaller wire always the larger one; and the at either station by turning the drum might cause them to move with great in in order to convey the which the letters it would only be to attach it by a string or by a catch to either of the of the endless wire thus it would be to the next station where it would be removed by the to the of the next wire and so it is to enter into the details which this or any similar plan would require the are but if these could be it would present many besides for if an resided at each station the expense of having two or three of letters every day and even of sending at any moment would be nor is it that the wire might itself be for a species of yet more rapid perhaps if the of were made use of them by a few with some great central as for with the top of st paul's; and if a similar were placed on the top of each steeple with a man to work it during the day it might be to the expense of the post and make every half hour over the greater part of the the power of steam however bids fair almost to rival the of these and the fitness of its to the of where great is begins now to be the extract from the report of the of the house of commons on clearly its various perhaps one of the from the use of steam will be that it may be as cheaply at a quick as at a slow rate; 'this is one of the over horse labour which becomes more and more as the speed is there is every reason to expect that in the end the rate of by steam will be much quicker than the utmost speed of by horses; in short the safety to will become the limit to speed' in the result takes place; 'in all cases horses lose power of draught in a much greater than they gain speed and hence the work they do becomes more as they go without of cost then we shall obtain a power which will insure a of far beyond the utmost speed of horses in and the of these may not have this point when once it has been that at equal speed we can use steam more cheaply in draught than horses we may fairly that every day's in the of the engines will induce greater skill greater and greater speed the of the will be for some time a if at present it can be used as cheaply as horse power the with the former modes of will first take place as to speed when once the of shall have been fully will induce economy in the cost of working them the however of mr shewing the greater with of fuel by engines on the that will soon teach a better of the engines and a less costly mode of the supply of steam nor are the of to the greater or to its greater than in the latter danger is in as large a as expense by greater speed in on the 'there is no danger of being run away with and that of being is greatly it is to control four such horses as can draw a heavy ten miles per hour in case they are or choose to run away; and for quick they must be kept in that state of courage that they are always for running away down hills and at sharp turns of the road in steam however there is little danger being and capable of its power in reverse in going down hills every witness has given the fullest and most of the perfect control which the has over the of the with the it can be stopped or turned under where horses would be totally another may be in which the object to be is so that it might be rarely wanted yet

nearly francs or l it is about three leagues or english feet long and in the lake of lucerne it has the form of a trough about six feet broad and from three to six feet deep its bottom is formed of three trees the middle one of which has a groove cut out in the of its length for small rills of water which are into it from various places for the purpose of the the whole of the slide is by about

rocks and passes over their summits it goes under ground and at other times it is over the deep gorges by feet in height the which this work the and skill in all its have excited the wonder of every person who has seen it before any step could be taken in its it was to cut several trees to obtain a passage through the all these however were and the had at last the of seeing the trees descend from

during their descent they to be only a few feet in length the for this part of the were simple from the lower end of the slide to the upper end where the trees were workmen were posted at regular and as soon as was ready the workman at the lower end of the slide cried out to the one above him let go the cry was from one to another and reached the top of the slide in three minutes the workmen at the top of the slide then cried out to the one below him 'il vient' it comes and the tree was down the slide by the cry which was from post to post as soon as the tree had reached the bottom and plunged into the lake the cry of lachez was as before and a new tree was in a similar manner by these means a tree every five or six minutes no to the slide which took place but which was when it did in order to shew the force which the trees from the great of their descent m rupp made for causing some of the trees to spring from the slide they by their no less than from to feet into the earth;

the same can be either more quickly or better it long before that period arrives indeed to make such an machine it is usually that in five years it ought to have paid itself and in ten to be by a better 'a cotton says one of the before a of the house of commons 'who left seven years ago would be driven out of the market by the men who are now living in it his had not kept pace with those who have been during that time by the that have taken place in that period' the effect of in seems to through a cause which may be thus a making the usual profit upon his capital in looms or other in perfect the market price of making each of which is a hundred pounds invents some but this is of such a nature that it cannot be adapted to his present engines he finds upon that at the rate at which he can dispose of his produce each new engine would repay the cost of its making with the profit of capital in three years he also from his of the trade that the he is about to make will not be adopted by other before that time on these it is clearly his to sell his present engines even at and new ones on the but the who gives only fifty pounds for the old engines has not so large a fixed capital in his factory as the person from whom he them; and as he the same of the article his profits will be larger hence the price of the will fall not only in of the cheaper by the new but also by the more working of the old thus at a reduced price this change however can be only for a time will arrive when the old in good repair must become the which took place not long ago in frames for making was so great that a machine in good repair which had cost l sold a few years after for l during the great in that trade the each other so rapidly that which had never been were in the hands of their makers because new had their utility the of watches when well made is very one was in going order before a of the house of commons to enquire into the watch trade which was made in the year ; and there are many of ancient date in the of the company which are still kept going the number of watches for home was in the year about if this supply was for great britain only it was by about ten and a half of persons are in some trades let out to hire and a certain sum is paid for their use; in the manner of rent this is the case amongst the and mr henson in of the rate of payment for the use of their frames states that the such a rent that besides paying the full for his capital he clears the value of his frame in nine years when the with which succeed each other is this rent does not appear some of these frames have been worked for years with little or no repair but arise which throw them out of either or some years since an article was called cutup work by which the price of was greatly from the of mr j rawson it appears that in of this change in the nature of the work each frame could do the work of two and many frames were thrown out of and their value reduced full this is of great if the numbers here given are nearly correct and if no other causes to the price of frames; for it shews the between the of those and their value the great of all between masters and workmen and of with the latter the of any with their trade is well by a mistake into which both parties fell and which was of very great misery in the lace trade its history is so well told by william allen a knitter who was a party to it that an extract from his as given before the of will best explain it i beg to say a few words the frame rent; the rent paid for lace frames until the year was s d a frame per week; there then was not any very great for persons to buy frames and let them out by the hire who did not belong to the trade; at that time an attempt was made by one or two houses to reduce the prices paid to the workmen in of a dispute between these two houses and another great house some little being paid in the price amongst the houses i was one chosen by the workmen to try if we could not remedy the evil we the parties and found them these two houses that were about to reduce the prices said that they would either reduce the price of making net or they would the frame rent the to the workmen was between the one and the other; they would suffer less in the of the thing by having the rent than the price of making net reduced they chose at that time as they thought the lesser evil but it has turned out to be for as the rent was raised upon the laid out in frames it induced almost every person who had got a little money to lay it out in the of frames; these frames were placed in the hands of men who could get work for them at the they were to pay an rent and then they were most likely to buy of the persons that let them the frames their meat their grocery or their the of these frames became upon them if any took place in the work they must take it at a very reduced price for fear of the that would fall upon them from the person who bought the frame thus the evil has been daily till in with the other evils crept into the trade they have almost crushed it to atoms the evil of not fairly to each tool or each article its value or even of not having a simple and between a master and his workmen is very workmen find it in such cases to know the produce of their labour; and both parties are often led to adopt which had they been well would have been as equally at in the results with the true of both at stamps and dies and presses for a great variety of are let out they are made by men small capital and are rented by workmen power also is rented at the same place are erected in large a variety of rooms in which each person may hire one two or any other amount of as his may require if any mode could be of power without much loss from to and at the same time of the made use of at any point a change would take place in many of the present system of a few central engines to produce power might then be erected in our great towns and each workman hiring a of power for his purpose might have it into his own house; and thus a might in some be if it should be found more back again from the system of great to that of the of water through a series of pipes might be for the of power but the would consume a portion another method has been in some and is at the mint it in the air from a large vessel by means of a this vessel is by pipes with a small piston which drives each coining press; and on opening a valve the of the air forces in the piston this air is then to the general and pumped out by the engine the of air might be for the same but there are some facts to elastic fluids which require further and before they can be used for the of power to any it has been found for in to blow a furnace by means of a driving air through a pipe of above a mile in length that any effect was at the in one some being a cat put in at one end found its way out without injury at the other thus proving that the did not depend on within the pipe the most form in which power can be is perhaps by the of the gases it is known that under several of these become liquid at acid for example is reduced to a liquid state by a of sixty one of the the use of these fluids would be that the exerted by them would remain until the last drop of liquid had assumed the form of gas if either of the of common air should be found to be capable of to a liquid state before it unites into a fluid with the other then we shall possess a ready means of power in any and to any will require the force to render it liquid and may be applied where still greater of power is wanted in all these cases the gases may be looked upon as springs of force which have been wound up by the of power and which will deliver the whole of it back again when these springs of nature differ in some from the steel springs formed by our art; for in the of the natural springs a vast of latent heat is forced out and in their return to the state of gas an equal is may not this very be with in their part of the to be in with gases will consist in the of the valves and packing to retain the fluids under the great to which they must be the effect of heat on these

being higher where they are used than where they were made that it is more to mend the old article than to a new such is usually the case in great cities with some of the locks with hinges and with a variety of of notes the amount of arising from the casual fixing of trees in the bottom of the river may be from the of by running upon them the is taken from the for the years and three hundred and

made in it by running against the snags the water may not enter the rest of the vessel and sink it this passage is not printed in italics in the but it has been thus marked in the above extract from its and from the that the most will afford of its truth report from the of the house of commons on the april chapter on amongst masters or workmen against each other there exist amongst the workmen of almost all classes certain rules or laws which govern their actions towards each other and towards their but besides these general there are others to each factory which have derived their origin in many from the mutual of the parties engaged in them such rules are little known except to those the several trades; and as it is of that their and should be we shall offer a few remarks upon some of them the by which such laws should be tried are first that they conduce to the general benefit of all the persons that they prevent fraud thirdly that they as little as with the free agency of each it is usual in many that on the first of a new he shall pay a small fine to the rest of the men it is clearly unjust to insist upon this and when it is spent in which is too often the case it is the reason for the demand is that the will require some in the habits of the shop and in the places of the tools and will thus waste the time of some of his until he is if this fine were added to a fund managed by the workmen and either divided at given periods or for their relief in it would be less since its would be to check the too change of men from one shop to another but it ought at all events not to be and the to be derived from the fund to which the workman is invited to ought to be his sole to in many the workmen on totally parts of the objects are yet in some measure upon each other thus a single smith may be able to forge in one day work enough to keep four or five turners during the next if from or the smith his work and does not furnish the usual supply the turners them to be paid by the piece will have their time partly and their gains it is in such that a fine should be levied on the but it is that the master should have with his workmen in such a rule and that it should be shown to each to his and it is very that such fine should not be spent in in some it is for the master to give a small any workman has a degree of skill or has the thus in horn into layers for one horn usually from five to eight layers; but if a workman split the horn into ten layers or more he a pint of ale from the master these should not be too high lest the should be wasted in but such when made are as they tend to produce skill amongst the workmen profit to the masters and cost to the in some few in which the men are paid by the piece it is usual when any portion of work in by a workman is by the master on account of its being badly to fine the such a tends to remedy one of the evils upon that mode of payment and greatly assists the master since his own is thus by and judges exist amongst some of the larger bodies of workmen and others have been formed by the masters engaged in the same of trade these have objects in view; but it is very that their effects should be well by the who compose them; and that the arising from them which are great should be as much as from the evils which they have too of workmen and of masters may with agree upon rules to be by both parties in the value of kinds of work in their trade in order that time may be saved and be they may also be most in as to the number of persons working in the various of any their rate of wages the number of in use and other details of this nature is highly both for the of the parties who are most and to enable them upon any to for or with a view to to supply those details without which the of any measure cannot be duly such details may be by men engaged in any branch of trade at a much smaller expense of time than by persons less with and less in it one of the most and most objects of such as we have just is to agree upon ready and certain modes of the of work done by the workmen for a long time a upon this point existed in the lace trade which was justly of by the men as a serious but the of the rack which counts the number of holes in the length of the piece has put an end to the most fertile cause of this was to by the of and a hope was in their report that the same would be applied to it

such gives a greater to honest than can readily be and removes one of the sources of between parties whose real must always suffer by any between them the effects arising from amongst the workmen are almost always to the parties there are in which the public suffer by price at the moment but are gainers from the which whilst on the other hand the which are often made in in of 'a strike' amongst the workmen most do injury of greater or less to that class which gave rise to them as the injury to the men and to their is almost always more serious than that which affects their it is of the utmost to the comfort and of the former class that they should sound views upon this for this purpose a few of the which is here will have greater weight than any of a more general nature though drawn from of economy such will present the of to facts known to many of those classes for whose benefit these are there is a process in the of gun barrels for making what in the of the trade are called skelps the skelp is a piece or bar of iron about three feet long and four inches wide but thicker and broader at one end than at the other; and the barrel of a musket is formed by forging out such pieces to the proper and then folding or bending them into a form until the edges overlap so that they can be welded about twenty years ago the workmen at a very factory in forging these skelps out of bariron for an advance of wages; and as their demands were very they were not with in the the of the his to the and it to him that if the of the rollers between which the bariron was rolled were to be made equal to the length of a skelp or of a musket barrel and if also the groove in which the iron was instead of being of the same width and depth were cut deeper and wider from a point on the rollers until it to the same point then the bariron passing between such rollers instead of being uniform in width and would have the form of a skelp on making the trial it was found to succeed a great of human labour was by the process and the workmen who had skill in it ceased to derive any from their it is that another and a still more of the effect of amongst workmen should have but a few years since in the very same trade the process of welding the skelps so as to convert them into gun barrels much skill and after the of the war the demand for muskets having greatly the number of persons in making them was very much reduced this more easy; and upon one when a had been entered into for a supply to be on a fixed day the men all struck for such an advance of wages as would have caused the of the to be with a very heavy loss in this the to a mode of welding the gun barrel for which a patent had been taken out by one of some years before this event the plan had not then so well as to come into general use in of the of the usual mode of welding by hand labour with some other with which the had to contend but the by the of the workmen induced him to make new trials and he was enabled to such a in welding gun barrels by rollers and such in the work itself that in all very few will in future be welded by hand labour this new process in folding a bar of iron about a foot long into the form of a with the edges a little it was then placed in a furnace and being taken out when raised to a welding heat a triblet or of iron was placed in it and the whole was passed quickly through a pair of rollers the effect of this was that the welding was at a single heating and the of the for the skelps to the length of the musket barrel was in a similar manner but at a lower the workmen who had were of course no longer wanted and instead of by their they were reduced by this in the art to a lower rate of wages for as the process of welding gun barrels by hand skill and they had been in the habit of earning much higher wages than other workmen of their class on the other hand the new method of welding was far less to the texture of the iron which was now exposed only once instead of three or four times to the welding heat so that the public derived from the as well as from the economy of the process another process has been to the of a lighter kind of iron tubes which can thus be made at a price which renders their very general they are now to be found in the shops of all our larger of various lengths and with screws cut at each end; and are in use for the of gas for or of water for warming our houses similar must have to all those who are with the details of our but these are to one of the results of it would not however be fair to push the deduced from these to its extreme limit it is very that in the two cases which have been stated the effects of were to the workman by almost placing him in a lower class with respect to his wages than he before; yet they do not prove that all such have this effect it is quite evident that they have all this it is also certain that must be applied to induce a man to a new and and that in both these cases unless the fear of loss had acted the would not have been made if the workmen had in either case for only a small advance of wages they would in all have been and the public would have been for many years of the to which these gave rise it must however be that the same skill which enabled the men to obtain after long higher wages than the rest of their class would prevent many of them from being thrown back into the class of workmen their wages will only until they have by a of in some other of the more but a of wages even for a year or two is still a very serious to any person who lives by his daily the of has then in these been to the workmen who of wages; to the public of price; and to the sale of his from that it is however to the effects of in another and less obvious point of view the fear of amongst the men whom he employs will have a to induce the to conceal from his workmen the extent of the orders he may at any time have and they will always be less with the extent of the demand for their labour than they might be this is to their for instead of by the gradual in the orders the of a time when they must be and they are liable to much more sudden changes than those to which they would be exposed in the given by mr the he remarks that when are to show their men that their is steady and certain and when men find that they are likely to have they have always better habits and more settled notions which will make them better men and better workmen and will produce great to all who are in their as the when he makes a has no that a may not arise amongst the workmen which may render that a loss instead of a besides taking to prevent them from with it he must also add to the price at which he could sell the article some small to cover the risk of such an if an consist of several which can only be carried on jointly as for of iron mines blast and a in which there are classes of workmen it becomes to keep on hand a larger stock of than would be if it were certain that no would arise suppose for the were to for an advance of there was a stock of coal above ground the must be stopped and the miners also would be thrown out of employ now the cost of keeping a stock of iron ore or of coals above ground is just the same as that of keeping in a drawer its value in money except indeed that the coal suffers a small by to the the of this sum must be as the price of an against the risk of amongst the and it must so far as it goes the price of the article and limit the demand which would exist for it but every which tends to limit the demand is to the because the wider the demand the less it is exposed to the effect to which we have alluded is by no means a the of one in the iron trade within the think it always to keep above ground a supply of coal for six months which is in that equal in value to about l when we reflect that the of capital the country thus kept merely from the fear of amongst the workmen might under other be used for keeping a larger number at work the of a system in which there should exist no to combine becomes evident that are while they last of serious to the workmen is by all and it is equally true that in most cases a result does not leave them in so good a as they were in before 'the strike' the little capital they which ought to have been hoarded with care for days of illness or is and in order to gratify a pride at the of which we cannot but rejoice even whilst we regret its energy they will undergo the rather than return to work at their former wages with many of the workmen during such periods bad habits are formed which it is very to and in all those engaged in such the kinder of the heart are chilled and are called into action which are to the of the and of those of which it is equally the of the master and of his workman to if any of the trade refuse to join in the strike the too forget in the of their the of justice and to exert a species of tyranny which can never be to exist in a free country in to the working classes that they have a right if they it to combine for the purpose of higher wages always that they have all their it ought ever to be kept before their that the same freedom which they claim for they are bound to allow to others who may have views of the of every effort which reason and can dictate should be made not merely to remove their but to satisfy their own reason and and to show them the which will result from their conduct but the strong arm of the law backed as in such cases it will always be by public opinion should be and applied to prevent them from the liberty of a portion of their own or of any other class of society amongst the evils which fall heavy on the working classes when through views they attempt to with their in the mode of on their may be the removal of to other where the may be free from the control of their men the removal of a number of lace frames to the western which took place in of the in has already been other have where still greater injury has been by the removal of a portion of the skill and capital of the country to a foreign land such was the case at glasgow as stated in the fifth report and one of the in an cotton factory by the conduct of the workmen removed to the state of new york where he his and thus to rivals already to our trade at once a pattern of our best and an example of the most methods of it when the nature of the work is such that it is not to remove it as happens with regard to mines the are more exposed to injury from amongst the workmen but as the owners are of a larger capital they succeed if the of wages which they propose is really founded on the of the case an lately existed amongst the in the north of england which led in several to acts of the of the were obliged to procure the aid of miners from other parts of england who were willing to work at the wages they could afford to give; and the aid of the civil and in some cases of the power was for their this course was in during several months and the being which party could support itself longest on the gains as it might have readily been the one of the by the masters against the of is to make with their men for long periods and to arrange them in such a manner that these shall not all this has been done in some cases at and in other places it is with the to the masters that during periods when the demand for their produce is reduced they are still obliged to employ the same number of workmen this however obliges the to direct their to in their works and in one such within the a large was thus a more supply to the whilst at the same time the mud from the bottom gave to a piece of land almost barren in this case not merely was the supply of produce checked when a glut existed but the labour was in fact applied more than it would have been in the usual course a mode of paying the wages of workmen in which they consume has been into some of our which has been called the truck system as in many this has nearly the effect of a of the masters against the men it is a fit subject for in the present chapter but it should be from another system of a very which will be first the for the support of a workman and his family are few in number and are usually by him in small weekly upon such sold by the retail dealer a large profit is made; and if the article is one whose quality like that of tea is not readily then a great gain is made by the retail dealer selling an article where the number of workmen living on the same spot is large it may be thought that they should unite and have an agent to by those which are most in demand as tea suger bacon etc and to retail them at prices which will just repay the cost with the expense of the agent who their sale if this be managed wholly by a of workmen aided perhaps by advice from the master and if the agent is paid in such a manner as to have himself an in good and it may be a benefit to the workmen and if the plan succeed in the cost of of to the men it is clearly the of the master to it the master may indeed be enabled to afford them in making their but he ought never to have the least in or any with the profit made by the sold the men on the other hand who to set up the shop ought not in the degree to be to make their there the and of the article ought to be their sole it may perhaps be that this plan is only a portion of the capital to the workmen in a retail trade; and that without it amongst small will reduce the to nearly the same price this would be valid if the objects of no but what has been already stated on that subject with the present the plan seems liable to no serious the truck system is in its effects the master keeps a retail shop for by his men and either pays their wages in goods or compels them by express or less by unfair means to expend the whole or a certain part of their wages at his shop if the kept this shop merely for the purpose of good at fair prices to his workmen and if he offered no to them to at his shop except the of his it would be to the men but this is not always the case; and the to the master in times of to reduce in effect the wages which he pays by the price of at his shop without the nominal rate of payment is too great to be if the object be solely to procure for his workmen better it will be more by the master himself to a small capital at a rate of leaving the details to be by a of workmen in with his own agent and the books of the shop to be audited by the men the workmen are paid in goods or are to at the shop much is done to them and great misery results from it may have been the of the master in such cases the real effect is to deceive the workman as to the amount he in for his labour now the on which the of that class of society depends are enough to be even by those who are blessed with far better of them and the of their being well with those which relate to is of more vital to workmen than to many other classes it is highly to assist them in the in which they are placed by all the in which they stand to each other and to their as simple as workmen should be paid in money; their work should be by some some piece of the time during which they are should be defined and adhered to the they make to their benefit should be fixed on such just as not to require in short the object of all who wish to promote their should be to give them in the form the means of knowing the sum they are likely to acquire by their labour and the money they will be obliged to expend for their support thus putting before them in the light the certain result of the cruelty which is on the workman by the payment of his wages in goods is often very severe the little for the comfort of his wife and perhaps the he for them in illness must all be made through the medium of barter; and he is obliged to waste his time in an in which the goods which he has been to accept for his labour are taken at a lower price than that at which his master charged them to him the father of a family perhaps under the agonies of the is obliged to make his hasty bargain with the village surgeon before he will remove the cause of his pain; or the mother is to her goods in for the last of her the from the report of the of the house of commons on shows that these are not it has been so common in our town to pay goods instead of money that a number of my have been obliged to pay for to pay sugar for drugs out of the shop; and others have been obliged to pay sugar for drapery goods and such things and in that way numbers of times i was that one person paid half a pound of sugar and a penny to have a tooth drawn; and there is a of mine told me that he had heard that the sexton had been paid for digging a grave with sugar and tea and before i came off knowing i had to give upon these things i asked this friend to enquire of the sexton whether this was a fact the sexton for a little time on account of into the person who paid these goods however he said at last 'i have these know these things have been paid to a great extent in this way' notes see chapter xv p chapter on of masters against the public a species of takes place amongst against persons having patents and these are always to the public as well as unjust to the some years since a a machine by which and were cut in and other fine woods the machine in some measure the in lathes; it work at a very expense but the met and against it and the patent has never been worked a similar fate awaited a machine for cutting veneers by means of a species of knife in this the wood could be cut thinner than by the saw and no waste was but 'the trade' set against it and after a heavy expense it was given up the excuse alleged for this kind of was the fear by the that when the public became with the article the would raise the price similar of seem not to be as appears by the report of the of the house of commons on patents for june see the of mr there occurs another kind of against the public with which it is to deal it usually ends in a and the public are then left to the of the not to charge them above the is not to make them pay so much as to induce them to combine against the this occurs when two supply water or gas to by means of pipes laid down under the in the street of cities it may occur also in docks canals etc and in other cases where the capital is very large and the very limited if water or gas combine the public loses all the of and it has that at the end of a period during which they have each other the several have agreed to divide the whole into two or more parts each company then its pipes from all the streets except those in its own portion this removal causes great injury to the and when the of rates induces a new company to start the same is again perhaps one remedy against evils of this kind might be when a charter is granted to such to to a certain amount the rate of profit on the shares and to direct that any profits beyond shall for the of the capital this has been done in several late acts of the maximum rate of profit allowed ought to be liberal to for the risk; the public ought to have on their part and the should be for the purpose of the from being it must however be that this would be an with capital which if allowed should in the present state of our be with great in each case until some general is on grounds an called a which the of gas used by each has been and a mode of the to be made by to the gas a similar in its nature might be used for the sale of water; but in that case some public might be from the which would then run to waste the streams of water running through the sewers in london are largely from this source; and if this supply were the of the might be in the north of england a has long existed among the by which the public has in the payment of price the late of before a of the house of commons has its mode of and the have that for the present the sale of coal should be left to the of other a of another kind exists at this moment to a great extent and upon the price of the very pages which are now it a subject so to every reader and still more so to every ofthe article which the reader an we have shown in chapter xxi p the parts of the expense of each copy of the present work; and we have seen that the total amount of the cost of its of any payment to the author for his labour is s d another fact with which the reader is more is that he has paid or is to pay to his six for the volume let us now examine into the of these six and then having the facts ofthe case before us we shall be better able to effects of the profits on a six book buys at; sells at; profit on capital s d; s d no ithe who to the author for every copy ; ; per cent no iithe who retails to the public; ; ; or ; ; no i the is a he is in fact the agent his duties are to receive and take charge of the stock for which he room; to advise the author about the times and methods of and to insert the as he other books he will lists of those sold by and thus by many in one the expense to each of his he pays the author only for the books sold; he makes no outlav of capital except that which he pays for but he is for any bad debts he may in of them his charge is usually ten per cent on the returns no ii is the who retails the work to the public on the of a new book the sends round to the trade to receive from them for any number of copies not less than two these copies are usually charged to the on an average at about four or five per cent less than the price of the book in the present case the price is s d for each copy after the day of the price charged by the to the is s d with some works it is the custom to deliver copies to those who order thus a of about four per cent such was the case with the present volume offer terms to the and it is usual after of about six months for the again to open a list so that if the work be one for which there is a steady sale the trade avail of these of at the reduced rate enough to supply their demand the volume thus of the at s d or s d is by the to the public at s in the first case he makes a profit of in the second of per cent even the smaller of these two rates of profit on the capital appears to be much too large it may happen that when a book is for the retail dealer sends across the street to the agent and for this service one fourth part of the money paid by the and perhaps the retail dealer takes also six months' credit for the price which the volume cost him in section the price of each process in the present volume was stated we shall now give an of the whole expense of it into the hands of the public the retail price s on total expense of and paper taxes on paper and to as agent between author and printer to as agent for sale of the book between price and trade price d per vol profit the between trade price and retail price s d per vol remains for total this account appears to with that in page but it will be that the three first amount to l s the sum there stated the arises from a which was not noticed in the first edition of this work the bill to l s as there given and as in the present volume an charge of ten per cent upon the real charges of the printer and it is usual for the when he is as agent between the author and printer to charge a of ten per cent on all he makes if the author is of this custom to his the work as was the case in the present he can have no just cause of for it is whether he himself employs the printer or with him through the of his the for this payment are the making with the printer the and the if there is a in having some person between the author and printer in case the former should any of the charges made by the latter as too high when the author himself is quite with the details of the art of he may object to charges which on a better with the subject he might be were very and in such cases he ought to depend on the of his who is with the art this is the case in the charge for and some of which trivial occupy the much time in making it should also be that the in this case becomes for the to those persons it is not that the author should avail himself of this it is the of the that he should; and usually that the author cannot procure his paper or at a cheaper rate if he go at once to the this appears from the given before the of the house of commons in the acts may mr o rees of the house of longman and co row q suppose a to publish a work on his own account and to incur all the various could he get the paper at s a ream? a i presume not; i presume a would not sell the paper at the same price to an as to the trade q the asked you if a private was to publish a work on his own account if he would not pay more for the paper than persons in the trade; the wish to be whether a printer does not charge a a higher rate than to a a i they charge a profit on the paper q do not the charge a higher price also for than they do to the trade? a i always that they do there appears to be little reason for this in for a larger price to the author than to the the former is able to give equal for the payment with respect to the charge on paper if the author employs either or printer to it they ought to receive a for the risk since they become for the but there is no reason why if the author deals at once with the he should not on the same terms as the and if he choose by paying ready money not to avail himself of the long credit allowed in those trades he ought to procure his paper cheaper it is time however that such between trades should be done away with in a country so for its wealth on its it is of that there should exist no abrupt of classes and that the highest of the should feel proud of being either or through their with those on which their depends the and already mix with those classes and the larger and even the are found with the gentry of the land it is good that this should be not by any rivalry in expense but by a rivalry in and in liberal and few things would more to so an effect than the of all such views as those to which we have alluded the to the other classes would be an with the arts of the country an to the of habits of and of and above all a general feeling that it is in any rank of life to our own and our riches by our talents in the or in the of wealth another omitted to be noticed in the first edition relates to what is called the which may be now when copies of a work are to be printed each sheet of it one ream of paper now a ream as used by of quires or sheets this excess of sixteen sheets is in order to allow for and the press for the due of its work and to supply the place of any sheets which may be dirtied or in the of or injured by the binder in putting into boards it is found however that three per cent is more than the and that damage is less in to the skill and care of the workmen from the of several highly and before the of the house of commons on the act may it appears that the average number of surplus copies above is between two and three; that on smaller it is less whilst on larger it is that in some the number of is not made up in which case the printer is obliged to pay for it; and that in no have the whole sixteen extra copies been on the volume in the hands the edition of which of the surplus to arising from the in and the care of the now this ought to be for to the i believe it usually is so by all in order to prevent the printer from taking off a larger number of than he to the author or various have been adopted in some works a has been used in paper made for the book thus the words appear in the of the two first volumes of the great work of laplace in other cases where the work is by such a fraud would be useless without the of the printer in france it is usual to print a notice on the back of the title page that no copies are genuine without the of the author and to this notice is the name either written or printed by hand from a wooden block but this i have a volume printed at paris in which the notice exists but no is in london there is not much danger of such frauds because the are men of capital to whom the profit on such a would be and the risk of the of a fact which must of be known to many of their workmen would be so great as to render the attempt at it folly perhaps the best advice to an author if he on his own account and is a person of common sense would be to go at once to a printer and make his with him if the author do not wish to print his work at his own risk then he should make an with a for an edition of a limited number; but he should by no means sell the if the work or it would be to make it part of the that they shall become the with the view to their use in a edition of the works if they should be an is made by which the the money and incurs all the risk on of his sharing the profits with the author the profits alluded to are for the present work the last item of section or l s having now all the in the present volume let us return to section and examine the of the l paid by the public of this sum l was the cost of the book l was taxes l was the charges of the in it to the and l for the largest portion or l goes into the pockets of the and as they do not advance capital and incur very little risk this appears to be an the most part of the charge is the per cent which is allowed as profit on the book it is stated however that all retail allow to their a of ten per cent upon orders above s and that the nominal profit of or per cent is very much reduced if this is the case it may fairly be why the price of l for example is printed upon the back of a book when every is ready to sell it at l s and why those who are with that should be made to pay more than others who are better several reasons have been alleged as this high rate of profit first it has been alleged that the of books take long credit this is often the case and it no person can object to a of price but it is no less clear that persons who do pay ready money should not be charged the same price as those who defer their to a remote period it has been urged that large profits are to pay for the great of that rents are high and taxes heavy; and that it would be for the great to compete with the smaller ones unless the retail profits were great in reply to this it may be that the are subject to no which does not attach to all other retail trades it may also be that large always have over smaller ones in the economy arising from the of labour; and it is to be that are the only class who in large neglect to avail of them thirdly it has been that this high rate of profit is to cover the risk of the having some copies left on his but he is not obliged to buy of the a single copy more than he has orders for and if he do more at the price he proves by the very fact that he himself does not that risk at more than from four to eight per cent it has been truly on the other hand that many copies of books are spoiled by persons who enter the shops of without to make any but not to mention that such persons finding on the tables various new are induced by that of them to become this damage does not apply to all nor to all books; of course it is not to keep in the shop books of small demand or great price in the present case the retail profit on three copies only namely s d would pay the whole cost of the one copy soiled in the shop; and even that copy might produce at an auction half or a third of its cost price the from in the sale of books and that arising from heavy stock are totally in the between and author it shold be also that the is a retail as well as a and that besides his profit upon every copy which he sells in his of agent he is allowed to charge the author as if every copy had been for at s d and of course he the same profit as the rest of the traders for the books in his own shop in the country there is more reason for a between the retail dealer and the public; because the profit of the country is by the expense of the of the books from london he must also pay a usually five per cent to his london agent on all those books which his does not himself publish if to this be added a of five per cent allowed for ready money to every and of ten per cent to book clubs the profit of the in a small country town is by no means too large some of the writers who have on the made in the first edition of this work have that the rate of profit to the is too large but they have on the other hand urged that too a case is taken in the whole copies sold if the reader will turn back to section he will find that the expense of the three first items remains the same be the number of copies sold; and on looking over the items he will that the who incurs very little risk and no outlay derives exactly the same profit per cent on the copies sold their numbers may be this however is not the case with the author on whom nearly the whole of the loss falls the same writers have also that the profit is fixed at the rate in order to enable the to sustain losses in the and retail of other books this is the weakest of all it would be equally just that a should charge an for an with any risk in order to repay himself for the losses which his own want of skill might lead to in his other that the profit in books is really too large is proved by several first that the same nominal rate of profit has existed in the trade for a long series of years the great in the rate of profit on capital in every other that until very lately a of in all parts of london were content with a much smaller profit and were willing to sell for ready money or at short credit to persons of at a profit of only ten per cent and in some even at a still smaller instead of that of per cent on the prices thirdly that they are unable to this rate of profit except by a the object of which is to put down all some time ago a small number of the large london entered into such a one of their objects was to prevent any from selling books for less than ten per cent under the prices; and in order to enforce this they refuse to sell books except at the price to any who signing an to that effect by degrees many were upon to join this and the effect of the it left the small no option between signing or having his nearly the whole trade about two four hundred persons have been to sign the as might be from a compact so to many of the parties to it have arisen; several have been placed under the ban of the who allege that they have not its rules and who accuse the party of using spies etc to entrap them the origin of this has been by mr of lane himself a in a printed and the list of who form the for this is copied from that printed at the head of each of the cases by mr allen j street arch j baldwin r row booth j duncan j row j r court murray j street rees o row j m j st paul's wilson e royal in manner the profits are divided between the and the retail the fact remains that the reader pays for the volume in his hands s and that the author will receive only s d; out of which latter sum the expense of the volume must be paid so that in passing through two hands this book has a profit of per cent this rate of profit has drawn into the book trade a larger share of capital than was really and the between the of that capital has led to the system of to which the above are to put a stop there are two parties who chiefly suffer from this the public and authors the first party can seldom be induced to take an active part against any and in fact little is from it except a cordial support of the authors in any attempt to destroy a so to the of both many an would be glad to sell for s the volume which the reader holds in his hand and for which he has paid s; and in doing so for ready money the who paid s d for the book would realize without the least risk a profit of eleven per cent on the money he had it is one of the objects of the we are to prevent the small from his capital at that rate of profit which he thinks most to and such a is to the public having derived little from my own and being aware that from the very nature of their they can be to the expense of them i may be to offer an opinion upon the subject which i believe to be as little by any of from the future as it is by any at the past before however we proceed to sketch the plan of a against row it will be fit to inform the reader of the nature of the forces and of his means of attack and defence several of the great find it to be the of reviews and even of the editors are paid in some very for their and it is to be that they should always mete out the justice on works by the sale of which their are the great and popular works of the day are of course with some care and with to public opinion without this the would not sell; and it is to be able to quote such as of under shelter of this a host of are written into a and by the aid of this process the shelves of the as well as the pockets of the public are to such an extent are these means that some of the of the day ought to be merely as that the reader may be in some measure on his guard against such modes of his he should examine whether the work is by the who is the of the review; a fact which can be from the title of the book as given at the head of the article but this is by no means a certain because in various exist between houses in the book trade which are not known to the public; so that in fact until reviews are in which have no they can never be safely trusted in order to put down the of no plan appears so likely to succeed as a of authors if any portion of the world were to unite and form such an and if its affairs were by an active much might be the objects of such an union should be to employ some person well skilled in the and in the trade; and to him in some central as their agent each member of the to be at liberty to place any or all of his works in the hands of this agent for sale; to allow any or list of books by members of the to be up at the end of each of his own the expense of them being by the of the books the duties of the agent would be to retail to the public for ready money copies of books by members of the to sell to the trade at prices agreed upon any copies they may require to cause to be in the or at the end of works by members any which the or authors may direct to prepare a general of the works of members to be the agent for any member of the the of any work such a union would present other and as each author would retain the liberty of putting any price he might think fit on his the public would have the of in price by between authors on the same subject as well as of that arising from a cheaper mode of the volumes sold to them one of the from such an would be the of a good and an review a work the want of which has been felt for several years the two and reviews the of the most are from widely causes signs of and decay the of is fast from the of the age; the new and new which that has demands for its new organs equally the of its power and of its moral whilst on the other hand the sceptre of the critics has passed from the grasp of those who its into feebler hands it may be stated as a in this that those most to supply are already engaged but it is to be that there are many who now supply to the of which they and that if once a and review were capable of in payment to its with the of its rivals it would very soon be with the best the country can produce it may also be that such a of authors would be to each other there are two to which an editor of a review is exposed the first is a to consult too much in the works he the of the of his review; the second a similar to consult the of his friends the plan which has been removes one of these but it would be very if not to destroy the other notes the whole of the details relate to the first edition of this work these details vary with books and those given in the text are to correct and are to works like the present it is now that the use of spies has been given up; and it is also known that the system of is again to by many so that the injury arising from this system pursued by the great affects only or most those whose to an promise most respect note to the second edition the cases nos and of those by mr should be upon this point; and as the public will be better able to form a by hearing the other side of the it is to be hoped the of the mr will publish those the trade a copy of which mr states is refused by the even to those who sign them at the moment when this opinion as to the for a new review was passing through the press i was that the of such an were already i have been to me that the in this chapter may subject the present volume to the of that which it has opposed i do not that and for this reason that the are too shrewd a class to supply such an to as their would prove to be if but should my readers take a view of the they can easily assist in the evil by each the of this little volume to two of his friends i was wrong in this all are not so shrewd as i had for some did refuse to sell this volume; others sold a larger number of copies in the preface to the second edition at the of this volume the reader will find some further on the effect of the chapter on the effect of in the demand for labour one of the most urged against is that it has a to much of the hand labour which was and in fact unless a machine the labour to make an article it could never come into use but if it have that effect its owner in order to extend the sale of his produce will be obliged to his this will induce them also to the new machine and the effect of this will soon cause the article to fall until the profits on capital under the new system shall be reduced to the same rate as under the old the use of has at first a to throw labour out of yet the demand upon the reduced price almost absorbs a portion of that labour and perhaps in some cases the whole of what would have been that the effect of a new machine is to the labour for the of the same of may be clearly by a society in which are not divided each man himself all the he each to labour during ten hours daily one of which is devoted to making shoes it is evident that if any tool or machine be by the use of which his shoes can be made in half the usual time then each member of the will enjoy the same as before by only nine and onehalf hours' labour if we wish to prove that the total of labour is not by the of we must have to some other of our nature but the same motive which urges a man to will become when he finds his with labour; and in such it is that many would employ the time thus in new tools for other of their he who has worked ten hours a day will employ the half hour saved by the new machine in some other want; and as each new machine adds to these new will open to his view which will as surely render to his in where are divided and where the of labour is the of in is almost to cause a greater demand for labour the new labour at its a higher degree of skill than the old; and the class of persons driven out of the old are not always for the new one; so that a certain must elapse before the whole of their labour is wanted this for a time amongst the working and it is of great for their that they should be aware of these effects and be enabled to foresee them at an early period in order to as much as the injury from them one very enquiry which this subject is the whether it is more for the of the working classes that should be so perfect as to defy the of hand labour; and that they should thus be at once driven out of the trade by it; or be forced to quit it by the slow and of the the which arises from a quick is more but it is also much less than that which results from the slower process and if the is to be the workman will at once set himself to learn a new of his art on the other hand new causes an demand for skill in those who make and repair it and in those who first its use; yet there are other cases in which it enables and workmen to execute work that greater skill in such even though the demand for the article by its price should give to all who were before yet the very of the skill would open a wider field of amongst the working classes that do not even at their first throw human labour out of must be and it has been by persons very to form an opinion on the subject that they never produce that effect the of this depends on facts which have not yet been and the of our not the data for the full of so a subject an reason for upon the minds of all who are in such the of at various times of the number of persons in of of the number of used by them and of the wages they receive in to the enquiry just i shall offer some remarks upon the facts within my and only regret that those which i can support by are so few when the mill used in and other mining the labour of a great number of young women who worked very hard in ores with flat hammers no the reason of this appears to have been that the of the mines having one portion of their capital by the of the process by the mills found it their to apply more labour to other the women from mere were thus in the ores a work which skill and in the the arising from in the or from modes of using it appears from the table a machine called in the cotton a worked by one man as follows year; pounds of cotton spun; roving wages per score; rate of earning per week s d s d the same man working at another the roving a little finer in this has until at the end of years three times as much work is done as at the the manual labour remains the same the weekly of the workmen have not very much and appear on the whole to have but it would be to push too far founded upon a single the produce of of 'mule yarn at periods was as follows year; hanks about to the pound; wages per s d ; ; ; ; ; ; the

persons to dress the warp total persons during this period the number of in has to less than whilst that of has to more than five times its former amount the total number of workmen has about but the amount of goods each to do only the work of three is three and a half times as large as it was before in this of it must be that the two persons thrown out of work are not exactly of the same class as those called into by the a must possess bodily which is not for a person a women and young persons of both sexes from fifteen to years of age find in this however would be a very limited view of the arising from the of the skill called into action in the new in the new in making the to drive it and in in the of the looms as well as in the economy of the is of a much higher order than that which it had in and if we any means of this it would be found larger in amount nor in this view of the subject must we omit the fact that would have in number if those moved by steam had not been yet it is the of the article by which has caused this great of their and that by the price of one article of we always call into the energy of those who produce others it appears that the number of in use in england and in was about ; nearly the same number existed in the year whereas the number of which in was had in been when it is that each of these did as much work as three worked by hand the power was equal to that of during the whole of this period the wages and of weavers have been very amongst the working classes may enable them to foresee some of those which are likely for a time to affect the value of their labour; and the of savings banks and the of which can never be too or too pressed upon their may be of some avail in the evil but it may be useful also to suggest to them that a of amongst the members of one family will tend in some measure to the which arise from in the value of labour notes in the wages were not to be less than s chapter on the effect of taxes and of legal upon as soon as a tax is put upon any article the of those who make and of those who use it is to the means of evading as large a part of the tax as they can; and this may often be in ways which are fair and legal an excise duty exists at present of d per pound upon all writing paper the effect of this impost is that much of the paper which is is made thin in order that the weight of a given number of sheets may be as small as soon after the first of the tax upon windows which upon their number and not upon their size houses began to have fewer windows and those of larger than before were lighted by long windows three or four flights of stairs when the tax was and the size of windows charged as single was limited then still greater care was taken to have as few windows as and lights became these lights in their turn became the subject of but it was easy to evade the of them and in the last act of the taxes they ceased to be from the changes thus in the number the forms and the of the windows a might in some be formed of the age of a house a tax on windows is exposed to on the double ground of its air and light and it is on both to health the of light to the of health is not perhaps in the cold and more it is of still greater than in warmer the effects of of excise upon our home are often of great and check the natural of it is for the of revenue to oblige to take out a license and to compel them to work to certain rules and to make certain stated at each when these are large as in general they are they deter from making and thus impede both in the mode of the and in the of new of this nature have in upon glass for optical but in this case has been by fit persons to make without the of the excise it ought however to be that such if or granted might be abused the against such an abuse will be found in the force of public opinion to bear upon men and thus the proper but with science to judge of the of the from the public of the from the given in before the of the house of commons on from sugar and it that by a mode of working from that by the excise the spirits from a given weight of corn which then gallons might easily have been to twenty gallons nothing more is for this purpose than to make what is called the wash weaker the of which is that goes on to a greater extent it was stated however that such a would render the of the duty liable to great and that it would not benefit the much since his price was to the by any of expense in the here then is a case in which a to of the total produce is lost to the country a similar effect arises in the coal trade from the effect of a duty for to the before the house of commons it appears that a of the very best coal is wasted the extent of this waste is very various in mines; but in some cases it amounts to the effects of duties upon the import of foreign are equally curious a in the united states where bariron was on its liable to a duty of per cent ad valorem whilst was charged at per cent only in of this tax large of iron rails for were into america under the of the of per cent in duty more than counter the expense of the iron into rails prior to its duties and when in amount are all liable to of a very serious nature from the frauds to which they give rise it has been stated before of the house of commons that made up in the form and with the of linen have been for the purpose of the bounty for calico made up in this way sells only at s d per yard whereas linen of equal is worth from s d to s d per yard it from the that one house in six months sold five hundred such pieces of calico in almost all cases heavy duties or are as well as for unless the are of very large there arises a price at which they will be by the the extent to which can be carried should always be in the of new duties or in the of old ones it has been pushed so far and is so between this country and france that the price per cent at which most can be is well known from the of mr it appears that from to per cent was the rate of on from england and that the larger the the less was the from given in the report of the watch and in it appears that persons were in the habit of in france watches lace silks and other of value easily and them in england at ten per cent on their worth in which sum the cost of and the risk of were the process in often depends upon the mode in which a tax is levied on the or on the article w atch glasses are made in england by workmen who from the glass house globes of five or six inches in out of which by means of a piece of redhot tobacco pipe guided round a pattern watch glass placed on the globe they crack five others these are ground and on the edges in the tyrol the rough watch glasses are at once from the glass house; the workman a thick ring of cold glass to each globe as soon as it is blown causes a piece of the size of a watch glass to be cracked out the portion of the globe is broken and returns to the melting pot this process could not be adopted in england with the same economy because the whole of the glass taken out of the pot is subject to the excise duty the thus stated as to modes of are not raised with a view to the removal of those taxes; their fitness or must be decided by a much wider enquiry into which it is not the object of this volume to enter taxes are for the both of liberty and and the evils which have been may be the least amongst those which might have been chosen it is however that the various effects of every tax should be studied and that those should be adopted which upon the whole are found to give the least check to the of the country in into the effect or to be from any mode of it is to examine a little into the of the parties who approve of the plan in as well as of those who object to it have where the persons paying a tax into the hands of have been adverse to any this in the case of one class of whose really was injured by a removal of the tax on the they from the payment for the duty about two months before they were called on to pay it to and the was that a capital always in their hands the which states this is well to promote a in such do you happen to know of an from calico to the repeal of the tax on printed answer i have heard of such an and am not at it there are very few who are in fact in the of the tax; there are two classes of one who print their own cloth send their goods into the market and sell them on their own they advance the duty to and pay it in cash before their goods are sold but before the goods are paid for being most sold on a credit of six months they are of course on that account as well as on others that have been stated in the repeal of the tax the other class of print the cloth of other people; they print for hire and on of the cloth when printed they receive the amount of the duty which they are not called upon to pay to sooner on an average than nine weeks from the of the goods where the is carried on upon a large scale the arrears of duty due to often amount to eight or even ten pounds and furnish a capital with which these carry on their it is not to be at that they should be opposed to the prayer of our the policy of giving upon home and of against those which can be more cheaply in other is of a very nature and except for the purpose of a new in a country where there is not much or spirit is to be all modes of taxing one class of the the to an unknown extent for the sake of another class the who would abandon that mode of their capital are highly one part of the price of any article under such of the with the profits of capital the other part of its price may be looked upon as charity given to induce the to an use of his capital in order to give to his workmen if the sum of what the are thus forced to pay merely on account of these where known its amount would even those who them; and it would be evident to both parties that the of capital in those of trade ought to be the of in a to certain sizes is with some good effect in an view arising chiefly from the smaller number of tools in making them as well as from less change in the of those tools a similar source of economy is in the navy by having ships divided into a certain number of classes each of which vessels of the same the rigging made for one vessel will fit any other of its class; a which renders the supply of distant more easy the effects of the removal of a are often very and they were perhaps never more than in the bobbin net trade in the years and these effects were however by the general rage for which was so during that period one of the patents of mr for a bobbin net machine had just then expired whilst another for an in a part of such called a turn again had yet a few years to run many had been granted to use the former patent which were charged at the rate of about five pounds per annum for each quarter of a yard in width so that what is termed a frame which makes bobbin net a yard and a half wide paid thirty pounds a year the second patent was in august of it having taken place it was not that on the removal of the arising from this patent a of persons became of in a trade which had yielded a very large profit the bobbin net machine little space; and is from that well adapted for a the which already existed were in the hands of the but a kind of mania for them seized on persons of all who could raise a small and under its bakers small farmers and in some cases even became anxious to possess bobbin net some few were rented; but in most of these cases the workman the machine he by of from l to l weekly for a six quarter and many with the mode of using the so paid others of more for them in their use; l or l being given for this the success of the first induced others to follow the and the were almost with orders for lace frames such was the desire to procure them that many persons a large part or the whole of the price in the hands of the in order to insure their having the supply this as might be raised the price of wages amongst the workmen in and the effect was felt at a from which was the centre of this mania smiths not used to flat filing coming from distant parts earned from s to s per week smiths to the work gained from l to l per weekthe forging smith if to his work gained from l to l per week and some few earned l per week in making what are called insides those who were best paid were clock and from all the round who from l to l per week the who put the parts of the machine l for their and a six quarter machine could be put in a or three weeks good workmen being thus induced to desert less of their in order to supply this demand the masters in other trades soon found their men leaving them without being aware of the reason some of the more however the cause they went from to in order to examine into the which had seduced almost all the from their own and it was soon that the men who had been working as in at the rate of s a week could earn l by working at lace in on the nature of this work the master that one part of the bobbin net that which held the bobbins could easily be made in their own they with the who had already more work ordered than they could execute to supply the bobbin at a price which enabled them on their return home to give such wages as were to retain their own workmen as well as yield a good profit thus an was for the of these bobbin net and the was not to be the immense supply of bobbin net thus poured into the market reduced its price; this in price the by which the net was made less some few of the for a short time carried on a trade; but were and many ruined the low price at which the fabric sold with its and beauty to extend the sale; and new in the the older ones still less of the body chapter i and general

support and protect them and to aid in the bones of the head and trunk support and protect organs; those of the arms are for tact and those of the lower are for support and bones have little but when they are and painful bones are with and move upon one another by means of joints these joints are of three kinds where the margins of the bones are closely applied with little fibrous tissue between as in the sutures of the head; those with limited motion which are very strong the parts being with tough and freely movable in this last group the are covered with which again is lined with a which a small amount of fluid the fluid to reduce their are also by the of bursæ or sacs of occur outside the joints under tendons and to reduce the nature and extent of the motion of a joint is defined and the bones are held by strong bands of fibrous tissue or these being more fully in joints where there is great pg freedom of motion or where there is great weight to be in a joint such as the hip there is a in the form of a strong capsule which the joint on all sides and limits its motion while hinge joints like the elbow and pivot joints such as that formed by the atlas on the axis have lateral that allow of freer motion in the which is the most freely movable joint in the body the is very lax in general the kinds of motion in joints may be said to be flexion and when much is applied to a joint and no results as in a sprain there is often much and even of the flesh which forms a large of the weight of the body of tissue of this two kinds are found the or striped muscle of animal life which is under the control of the will and so is known as muscle and the or smooth muscle of organic life over which we have no control that is the muscle each fiber of striped muscle has an elastic

from an muscle showing network of blood hill the muscles vary in shape in parts of the body being long and slender in the limbs and broad and flat in the trunk they are chiefly to bones but also to and skin either by means of tendons which are cords or bands of white fibrous tissue or by means of of the same nature most muscles consist of a belly and two ends or tendons the origin is the fixed point from which it acts while the movable point upon which it acts is known as its action of the to bones muscles are in three ways when it is to produce much motion rapidly a short muscle is used when a part needs to be moved far and much on the part of the muscle is needed the muscle is very long as in the case of the pg muscle which half its length finally where less has to be covered but greater power is tendons are used as in this case the is but does not carry the part far in the work of the body the muscles are aided by the fact that the bones to which they are largely are set loosely and form a set of levers on which the muscles act to perform certain acts all three classes of levers occur where the fulcrum is between the weight and the power as in the case of the head which is by the muscles of the neck on the where the weight is between the fulcrum and the power as when a person raises himself upon his toes; and where the power is between the fulcrum and the weight as when the biceps is used to raise a weight held in the hand the erect of the body is to because the center of gravity is high up and it is by the of many muscles in the legs thighs back abdomen and neck that the body is upright upon the feet of or to and or the power to are the two most of muscle occurs in to nervous energy brought by the nerves a nerve going to each muscle fiber into which it plunges its being lost and its sheath with that of the muscle fiber any as heat etc when applied to the nerve causes the muscle to muscle has an of its own and can of the nervous system in it and the two ends closer and becomes firm and rigid the amount of depends upon the of the and the of the muscle the minimal is the least that will cause a pg and the maximal is one that will cause the the work done depends in like manner upon the of the during certain sounds are given off called muscle sounds which can be heard with the but have no special the muscles which have the power of rapid are to levers indeed muscle is by the and with which it works though its motion is slight smooth muscle on the other hand is by its great force rhythm tone and slight that is its is slower and lasts longer than that of muscle cardiac muscle is by great rhythm and force fair and slight being the amount of tone or to work for even in sleep muscle is always in tone that is ready to do its work it is this that makes the in between a living and a dead person and enables one to spring to his feet at night if he hears a noise a thing he could not do if his muscles were wholly relaxed thus is the great of of smooth and rhythm of cardiac muscle in the muscles droop and lose their tone muscles are the seat of when set free energy work in muscle there is a good deal of energy which is set free as heat and as work even when the muscles are at rest changes are going on and heat is being though more heat is when they are if the body upon its gross motions for all its heat it would grow cold while a person rested the organs however and the heart are always working and changes are taking place a muscle has some object in such as the raising of a load and it more or less to the pg weight of the load the amount of work done is in or that is the energy to raise one pound one foot or one gram one meter as a rule the muscles with the longest fibers as the biceps do the most work and those with a large number of fibers do more than those with less it has been that whereas an engine gives back of the energy of the coal muscle of the energy brought to it in the form of food during the or sugar in the muscle is used up and the muscle becomes more acid owing to the lactic acid that is formed the carbon is taken in and carbon dioxide given off puts the muscle in to do its work but is not so much used up in the work as is the so it is the matter that does the work and any in urea the of protein is mere wear and tear sudden heat or cold causes and heat favors both and nervous cold however lessens the force of and below zero muscle very largely loses its without rigid while well with blood muscle will without fatigue but if the blood supply is shut off it soon loses its and becomes rigid the more a muscle is used in the more it but after it has done a certain amount of work it becomes losing its or power to respond to stimuli and later rigid such fatigue is due to the of certain waste which have a effect on the nerves and which are carried away in the blood but which if to excess too fast for the blood wholly to remove them usually the nerve becomes first and the muscle later so long as it is with the nervous pg system a muscle will respond to stimuli but when the nerve becomes tired is more rapid in fact the degree of is by several factors as by to the central nervous system in blood supply and the process being more rapid in warm than in cold blooded animals cilia—a few motions are by tissue that is not as in the case of the cilia to the cells of the tract which lie flat on the free surface and then lash forward serving in the air cells to keep the air in motion and in the tubes to send from below upward and outward and to keep out foreign bodies cilia are also found in the female genital tract where they aid the passage of the ovum from the ovary to the womb they act though not by the nervous system as in the white of the blood whose motion also is not the changes that take place in are about the same as those in tissue that is the most of the tissues just is brought in the blood which through the body in a system of hollow tubes the and veins whence it is through the agency of the system there are no however in the nails hair teeth nor in the cornea of the eye the vessels that carry the blood from the heart are called those that return it veins the former begin as large vessels and in size; the latter begin as small vessels and form larger and larger trunks as they the heart the have three coats a thin serous coat the or intima; a middle or coat and an coat of tissue the middle coat is the and is the one that the walls from when cut across except in the pg cranium each artery is in a sheath with its vein or veins the venæ comites usually the occupy and are in their course where a vessel has to itself to the of a part however it may be curved as in the case of the facial artery which is curled on itself to allow for of the jaw they or freely with one another thus of and and making good even after the of a large vessel the veins have three coats like the but they are not so thick and the coat is not so highly so that the walls when cut and have no there are on the surface of many of the veins due to the of valves these valves are formed of folds of the lining and are in pairs they serve to prevent the blood whose in the veins is from flowing back there are two sets of veins the and the deep which with each other in fact all the veins large and small very freely in the skull and neck where would result in serious trouble the spinal cord and in the abdomen and pelvis the deep veins the in their sheath while the ones have thicker walls and run between the layers of the fascia under the skin in the deep veins in the skull the venous take the form of sinuses formed by a of the layers of the dura mater with an lining that is with that of the veins the are between the and the veins the final of the and the first source of the veins they are tiny vessels with but a single coat with the coat of both and veins and of one layer of cells with a small amount of tissue between pg they spread in a great network the tissues forming and being where the blood is needed for other than local as in the glands their is so small that the red have to pass in single file and may even then be out of shape as they have no tissue in their walls they have no power of their walls however like those of the smaller and veins are porous and by virtue of this quality they play an part in the economy since in them the takes place between the tissues and the blood the in general carry freshly blood and the veins blood from which the oxygen has been largely used up and which waste in the system however the case is the venous blood as it is called from the heart to the lungs to be and the veins the blood after it has its new supply of oxygen the pumping of the blood through the is by the of the coat while the elastic tissue of which it a certain amount gives to the walls and enables them to stretch and so to the larger blood supply forced into them at each beat by the heart the walls of the veins have not the power of and the blood is pushed through more by gravity and the action of the than by any action of their own the walls of all the vessels are by tiny in the outer coat known as vasa vasorum and the nerves that the action of the are the nerves from the center in the medulla impulse goes from this center to the all the time to keep them in a state of tone that is which is or as the blood supply is to be or system also extends the body and of a system of spaces and glands very closely related to the system and a fluid called lymph there are three parts to the system the lymph spaces which are open spaces with no walls in the tissue of the body more near and veins and so among the the lymph or small vessels which connect the lymph spaces; and the vessels of which there is a deep and a set the latter the veins on the surface of the body the former the deep fig showing the course of the main trunks of the system the of lower d meet the of the lac at the chyli rc where the duct begins the vessels are shown in the diagram on the right arm and leg s and the deeper ones on the left arm d the glands are here and there shown in groups the small right duct opens into the veins on the right side the duct opens into the union of the great veins of the left side of the neck t yeo the lymph spaces are small though there are some large serous such as the abdomen that may be as lymph spaces fig of a gland showing a l and e l c; m; fibrous coat c; sending tr into the of the gland where they branch and in the part form a the are by the lymph path or sinus l s which them from the adenoid tissue l h sharpey the vessels have walls with three coats like the though much thinner and even more freely than the veins they have a beaded due to the of valves which form on their surface the right duct which is only about an inch long drains all the of the right half of the upper part of the trunk the head and the neck while the duct drains those of the rest of the body the latter which is the largest vessel of the pg system begins the second lumbar with a for the lymph or chyle the chyli and extends up along the spinal column for a of about inches to the seventh where with the right duct it empties into the left vein at its with the jugular thus direct between the lymph spaces and the venous system the of both vessels are guarded by valves to prevent of the blood fig glands of the axilla after leaf the glands are small oval bodies and occur here and there along the course of the before one of them the vessel breaks up into several vessels which form a plexus within and then emerge again as several vessels which soon unite to form one trunk these glands occur chiefly in the along the great vessels and in the axilla neck elbow groin and space the lymph varies in with the being a little thicker and more in the as the of the pg small are called during when fat is present here it is called chyle it is a clear and fluid which owing to the of fibrin clots when drawn from the body and allowed to stand in fact it blood plasma very closely in and as it also a certain number of or that just to the white of the blood it is blood without the red these have power of amœboid and are thought by some to play an part in the of food owing to the lymph into the lymph spaces and bathes the tissues being carried away again by the the amount of is by the blood greater the the greater the amount of is by some organic action of the cells in the walls of the vessels in the process of a certain amount of solid matter goes through the wall of the vessel and it is that certain protein can be carried thus from the to the though they do not pass through the wall as readily as other some lymph is also formed by the action of the tissues though the process is not all active or passive the tend to drive the lymph on its way by the valves of the vessels keeping it from flowing back its flow is from the to the veins or from a region of high to one of less there is also some in the walls of the vessels and the of lymph helps to drive it along if an to the occurs however results and causes too great in that event a limb becomes swollen pale and cool it pits on pg the driving the lymph out and there being no to bring it back this is called œdema and occurs in liver kidney and heart being first at the ankles in ascites and and pleural the fluid to lymph in its and the large amount is due to of the fluid which is present in small lymph gives the tissues from the blood that they need and carries off those they do not whether waste or of use to other tissues because they thus absorb certain not needed by the tissues and convey them to the the have also been called indeed lymph may be spoken of as the between the blood and the tissues another of the lymph is to thus the fluid of the joints is lymph and the pleuræ and the contain lymph or serum to reduce the between the as much as the brain and spinal cord do not quite fill the of the cranium and the spinal column but float on a cushion of lymph the fluid when the brain which is subject to and in size in size it drives the lymph out and when it the lymph returns the lymph glands serve as a to parts and when it leaves the gland the lymph is purer and richer in than when it entered in fact they filter harmful matter from the lymph and also form white they can with be felt but in disease if the are unable to destroy or carry off the poison the lymph carries it along to the glands which swell and become tender if the is not severe the goes down and the passes after a short time but if it is severe there may be and abscess and pg the gland even perhaps be giving its life for the health of the part thus a wound in the foot if may cause and of the glands at the knee and in the groin the glands are the seat of in the neck and are in scarlet fever and in there is general and the glands in the groin become in all of the genital organs in growths such as cancer the of the disease is often along the lines of the glands in general a word might now be spoken they are of two kinds and and when simple are formed by the folding in of a free surface as in the case of the gastric and glands the cells at the gland so as to be able to perform the of or in glands the gland is broken up into many pockets glands take from an organ or from a part which have their and are to be cast out of the body while the glands form from the blood that did not exist in it before but which are of use to the body as the ptyalin of the saliva a strict line cannot however be drawn between the two kinds of glands most glands more or less of both though the and sweat glands are purely glands and the glands are almost purely the glands are more or less in their that is they have and one gland can take up and do for another what that other is for some reason unable to do in where there is of the bile duct the kidneys help out the liver by the bile if one kidney is removed the other does work for both and the glands of the skin may help out the kidneys or vice versa from the lungs occurs in of the in a general way the of glands is they filter out by osmosis the useful parts for and the useless for in the action that goes on energy is given off as is shown by the amount of in the glands and by the fact that their is higher than that of the blood they all work in a reflex manner being under the control of the central nervous system thus what is eaten affects the nerve in the mouth the passes to the nervous system and an impulse is carried by the motor nerves to the glands most of the glands have ducts to convey away their to other parts of the body or to send out of the body but there are also glands which though they seem to have some in the process of are not well most of them seem to some that is by the tissues and that plays an part in the bodily though nothing is by them they are said to have an whereas the glands with ducts have an the liver has both forms of the bile which is sent out and the that is stored the glands are the thymus and thyroid glands the and the body in the brain nervous over all the organs muscles and as the source of all action and all are the nerves nervous tissue is of two kinds the gray or which and and the white or fibrous which conveys the gray matter of large cells of nuclei which give off many or from the under surface there usually comes one main branch the process these pg give off and not but they form the nerve fibers and carry away from the nerve cells the cells of the are in shape have a nucleus and are placed end to end with a between them each process is by a sheath called the sheath while each nerve fiber of a central process by the white of schwann and in a sheath a bundle of these fibers in a called the a nerve and of these the white matter is formed the blood supply is brought by minute vessels the vasa fig nerve fiber a b sheath; c d e node of ranvier leroy the nerves of the system preside over animal life and have to do with acts while those from the system organic life and are quite of the will both sensory and motor nerves extend all over the body the in a general way the sensory nerves end on the surface in in end bulbs in the papillæ of the skin or in tactile these last more where there is no hair the motor nerves end in or by end plates the central of the motor nerves and the of sensory nerves in special organs except where they end in a cell are not well like muscles nerves are never at rest for through them the muscles get their tone when a nerve acts no heat is and there is no change in the nerve as there is in muscle nerve impulse is the of rather than pg changes along the fiber the atoms of the nerve being set in and the being along its length is by injury by by by heat and the message is always to the nerve thus if the nerve at the elbow over the “crazy bone” is touched a is felt in the fingers rather than at the point of a person who has had an arm or leg will speak of his fingers or toes on that side being cold or of pain in them because the scar below the point of around the nerves and pinches them it is through the nerves that people get in touch with the outer world and that they judge of size weight etc all careful of the muscles is under the control of the nervous system pg chapter ii the skin its and its the whole surface of the body is covered by the skin an and organ which serves as a to the parts beneath and is also the organ of touch it has two layers a and a deep the layer the or cuticle is wholly of cells of which the deepest layer is and moulded upon the layer of the derma while the layers are more rounded and the surface ones flat the deepest layer also the skin pigment which causes the in shade between the indian the negro and the white man below the which is chiefly is the tough elastic and tissue of the derma or true skin in which are vested most of the of the skin its surface is covered with papillæ which are more in the more parts each papilla one or more loops and one or more nerve fibers while some in an oval body known as a tactile beneath the papillæ is the layer of bands of fibrous tissue and and nerves as well as muscle fibers where hair is present fig section of skin pg at the of the body the skin stops and is by mucous an of greater but which of the same two layers a and a deep fibrous derma it is with the skin but is much redder and more and bleeds more easily the and that it lines unlike those lined by serous with the of the body and are for that reason against contact with foreign by mucus which is thicker and more sticky than the lymph that the found on serous mucous is found in the canal the tract and the tract in like the stomach and which are subject to in it is thrown into folds or rugæ the mucus is by small glands in the of the skin has various on the dorsal surface of the last of the fingers and toes are and horny of the nails they have a root in a groove of skin by which they grow in length and a matrix of derma beneath them which gives growth in to their growth in length there seems to be no limit the hairs also which occur all over the body except on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet are a of the each hair has a bulbous root from an in the and derma called the hair into which one or two glands empty it is raised by muscle fibers and grows by to the surface by which it is this growth seems however to be limited and when its term pg is reached the hair falls out and is by another the horny cells that go to form the hair contain the pigment that gives it its color fig —skin and section of hair a b corium; c gland; d fibrous e glassy f outer g inner h bulbous end of hair; i papilla of hair; j pili; k adipose tissue leroy like the hairs the glands are in all parts of the body except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet they lie in the layer and empty into the hair except when they empty upon the surface of the skin they secrete an oily sebum the débris from the of the cells of the gland itself which serves to keep the hair glossy and the skin soft and the sweat glands on the other hand are more on the palms and soles and though found in the derma are usually lower down in the tissue they are least on the back and neck coiled up in the lower layers of the skin they the sweat through a spiral duct upon its free surface the sweat is a clear watery fluid with a salty taste an and a odor that varies with the if very scanty it may be acid in besides water it a small of solids as salts sodium fatty acids neutral fats and at times in some of the kidneys urea that is the of the of and fats chiefly there is usually also some carbon dioxide whence the the sweat serves to keep the skin moist and in good to remove outworn and or matters and to the as a rule it upon the surface in which case it is known as or but if of the are not to prompt as when the air is damp the skin becomes damp and there is visible though an supply of blood the action of the sweat glands they are by nerves rather than by the nerves in a cold sweat the action is due to some of the nerve supply without of the blood supply is a reflex act due to the of the nerves as by the of heat but as in cases of strong are sent from the brain to the spinal centers and so arouse the action of the glands atropin has the power of the of sweat pg by the of the nerves while an effect in a similar way on account of these sweat glands the skin becomes next in after the kidneys in the of waste the of sweat varies greatly and is hard to measure it is by the and of the air by the nature and of food and drink by the amount of the of other organs the kidneys and by certain mental the hotter it is the greater the amount of in damp weather there may be less but it does not and is more in man has a of ° the source of this body heat or is the general body and of the glands of the liver which is active the blood in the hepatic vein being warmer than that in any other part of the body the tissue of the brain also is said to be warmer than the blood and the heart and muscles which are in are for much of the body heat the amount of heat in the body varies at times as a person is awake or asleep quiet or active is by in the and loss of heat less being known of its than of its loss it has been that of the energy of the body is into heat into work as the minimum amount of heat in hours is to raise gallons of water from ° to it is evident that if there were not some way for the escape of much of this heat the body would become hotter and hotter and finally destroy itself the however except on the surface is uniform heat being pg lost as fast as it is for at any point raises the heat of the blood at the point this heat is carried by the blood to other parts to which the surplus is given up while blood cooled in the skin goes to the hotter inward parts to cool them and be warmed itself in fact heat is by and through and heat given to the urine and fæces it is largely to per cent carried off through the skin and the lungs; to per cent is lost by to the air and other bodies with which the body comes in to per cent is lost by the of sweat to per cent by the warming of expired air urine and feces and to per cent by cold food that is taken in acts more where the are cool and the air in motion as on a breezy day is carried on best where the air is cool if it is moist for moist air is a better of heat than dry air is very in hot weather or where men work in hot air even in health the may range from ° to ° and a degree or two below or above is not when a person first gets up in the morning his is apt to be but after food and have been taken it becomes normal and stays so till the end of the day when if the person is tired it may go up a little if a person is tired out the is apt to be there is also in the body what is called the vital tide which is highest and evening and lowest in the morning the rate of of heat varies greatly in people one person uses a certain amount of tissue more quickly than another that is he lives faster size makes a in that a small body has more surface to its weight than a large one and so has to produce the same amount of heat at a faster rate in order to the right taking food heat because of pg the effort needed to eat it work is another factor and finally the whole matter of heat seems to be under the control of the nervous system not much is known on this point except that there is a heat center in the medulla which plays an part in heat and whose is seen where the shoots way up in disease just before death it is now thought that fever is due to a of this nervous though just what the is is not known fever is a of bodily due to or to loss of heat as a rule in all fevers the changes in the body are hence the patient becomes in a long fever the in the amount of urea during fever shows an in protein the in fevers rises as high as ° and in to ° except in a higher than ° means death is due to a in the bodily and so to heat as a rule if the are all active that of the sweat glands a person can be exposed to severe heat without the being though on a hot summer day it may be up half to one degree the cause of with its high fever is unknown but it is due to some effect on the heat center in the brain heat is also due to to heat but is by a the effect of cold as in is to all the of the body the can be more or less by of food varying amounts of by drugs etc sense of passing on to a of the parts a few words might well be said of the sense of touch since that is general and resides largely in the skin whose other pg have just been it may be as the form from which all the other special senses have certain of the body having become more than others to certain as the eye to those of light the organs have little sense of touch figs from man; × böhm and huber touch is useful only within arm’s reach but there gives one a sense of space that sight does not give it is by the touch which are found in the skin over almost the entire body though they are more in some places than in others the of the the of the skin these touch are bodies nuclei about which are from the nerves where the are absent the of the nerves play an part the finger tips have a very sense of touch and the tip of the tongue is the most part of the body pg hence spaces in the mouth seem larger than by the of of touch to the brain the is and the tactile becomes a tactile there are three main of the sense of touch of touch proper or tactile of and of pain the sense is the by the skin of not so much of a certain degree of heat or cold as of the between the of an object and that of the skin the longer an object is in contact with the skin the less the person is of it not only because it becomes of the same but also because he becomes to it there also seem to be in the skin besides the touch two other organs with nerve fibers the one for heat the other cold; for there are places on the body where heat can be and cold cannot and vice versa of pain may be merely an of tactile as in too hard or too great heat but there seems to be also a of pain in the skin all organs are said to have common to pain and any of this causes a of pain all the special senses require a certain amount of in the of the they convey pg chapter iii the cranium and face the and all the special senses except the sense of touch already spoken of are in the head where they are with bony tissue the brain is the skull or cranium which is made up of eight bones the frontal the two two the and the ethmoid while the bones of the face are in number two nasal two two two malar two palate two the vomer and the for the most part the bones are in pairs one on either side the cranial cranium or skull is adapted for the of the brain and the bones are flat and closely fitted to its surface they have two layers of bone the outer and the inner tables of which the outer is the thicker and between these is a tissue filled with the diploë in the infant whose brain has not yet its full size must be left for growth and the skull of a number of bones with notched edges where growth takes place but in the adult it forms one solid of bone the line where the edges of two cranial bones come is called a suture the suture between the frontal bone and the forward edges of the two bones is called the coronal suture that between the two bones at the vertex of the skull is known as the or suture and that between the bone and the back edges of the bones as the where the coronal and sutures meet is a known as the while the is at the of the with the suture these called from the of the brain that can be seen in after birth either by the of the bones or by the in them of small bones known as wormian bones the one closing within a few months the by the end of the second year in rickets however the remains open a long time into the fourth year fig at birth showing sutures and the frontal bone as its name implies forms the fore part of the head or it joins the bones above and the bones on either side at the lower edge are the arches each with a notch or foramen on its inner margin for the passage of the vessels and nerve the nerve most in just above the arches on either side are the ridges behind which between the two tables of the skull lie the frontal sinuses on the inner surface the frontal sulcus for the sinus runs along the median line the bones are the side bones of the skull they meet pg each other in the suture at the median line above and join the frontal and bones at either end while below they touch upon the bones the muscles being in part along their lower surface these muscles are into the process of the lower jaw which they thus help to raise and to retract fig —front view of the skull after sobotta the bone is at the base of the skull and at birth of four pieces in the lower part is the foramen magnum an oval opening through which the spinal cord passes from the skull down into the spinal canal half way between the foramen and the top of the bone is the for the of the nuchæ which holds the head erect the inner side of the bone is deeply concave and is divided by a grooved ridge into four fossæ the pg being where the arms of the cross meet the lobes of the lie in the two upper fossæ and the of the in the two lower ones in the grooves upon the ridge are the sinuses which collect the blood from the brain the and frontal muscles united by a thin cover the whole upper cranium and are known as the muscle at the back this is to the bone while in front it with various face muscles it is a muscle and raises the brows the and draws the scalp forward long hair grows on the skin over it as a further against blows upon the skull and sudden in the to be so named because the hair over them is the first to turn with age—are at the sides and base of the skull and are in three the or the mastoid or and the petrous or stony portion the is the upper portion and has from its lower part the long arched process which with the malar bone of the face and from which arises the muscle one of the chief muscles of which has its in the ramus and angle of the lower jaw just above the process the muscle has its origin in part while below is the glenoid fossa for with the condyle of the lower jaw the portion of the fossa being by part of the parotid gland the rough mastoid portion of the bone is toward the back and affords to various muscles of which the most are the and the within it are the mastoid cells which with the inner ear and are lined with mucous with that of the they have to do with the hearing in they often become pg the seat of mastoid abscess in and the mastoid bone has to be cut to let out pus that has as the lateral sinus is behind the mastoid bone there is very great danger of going through into the sinus and causing a fatal fig —side view of the skull after sobotta the petrous portion which the organ of hearing is between and behind the other two at the lower edge of the bone wedged between the and the bones on its outer surface is the meatus and from below a long sharp spine called the styloid process to which several minor muscles are in the same angle between the petrous and lies the bony tube the or wedge bone so called because in the process of it serves as a wedge lies at the base of the cranium forming as it were the part of the floor of the pg cavity the brain it is a large bone and with all the cranial and many of the facial bones binding them all it has a body two large wings and two lesser wings and appears on the outside of the skull between the frontal and the bones behind the process in the adult the body of the is out into the sinuses in which pus forms the ethmoid bone—in front of and below the and forward to the frontal bone is the ethmoid the last of the cranial bones it of a or plate from either side of which depend lateral masses of ethmoid cells to the inner side of these masses are the thin curved bones and middle while between them is a plate that forms the bony septum of the nose rising from the upper surface of the plate is another plate the crista galli with the grooves on either side for the of the bulbs of the nerve passing down through the of the plate to the nose for the brain which fills almost the entire cavity of the cranium is by the and ethmoid bones as it is by the other cranial bones of of all the sutures occurs idiocy results while in there is a gap in the of the bones so that the or brain in rickets the is high and square and the face bones poorly so that the head looks larger than it really is in paget’s disease the bones enlarge and soften this affects the head but not the face and often the first thing noticed is that the hat is too small is of the bone in places the bone like and being easily bent it is caused by of the pillow or the nurse’s arm bones of the facial bones serve to form the various pg of the face which after all are merely organs of special sense many muscles control the facial which or the of their owner the most of the facial bones are the two bones because of the number of to which they are liable they meet in front forming the upper jaw and with the malar bone help form the lower part of the orbit of the eye they are cuboid in shape and are out into a cavity called the antrum of which opens by a small orifice into the middle nasal meatus and which becomes and has to be tapped the nasal process for with the frontal and nasal bones has at its lower edge a crest for the bone and close beside this on the inside down from the upper edge is a deep groove which with the and bones helps to form the canal for the nasal tear duct the bones give to many small muscles for the most part with the nose and mouth of which the is the only one the two malar or cheek bones are small bones which form the of the cheeks and help form the orbits of the eyes from each is a process for with the process of the bone while a process extends for with the here again the most muscle is the if the malar bone is crushed great results the bones are two small bones about the size and shape of a at the front of the inner wall of the orbit at the edge is a groove which lodges the sac above and forms part of the canal below the two palate bones are at the back of the nasal fossæ and help to form the floor of the nose the roof of the mouth and the orbit each pg has a and a plate and it is these last that by their form the hard palate in cases of harelip cleft palate also occurs the result of to remedy the opening in the roof of the mouth which makes is to though a plate is fitted over the opening by a dentist the nasal bones are two small oblong bones which with the frontal and bones and with each other they form the bridge of the nose the rest of the nose being wholly of except for the vomer a bone shaped like a which forms part of the nasal septum along its edge with the ethmoid and the the two bones lie along the outer walls of the nasal fossæ they are thin bones covered with mucous and serve to heat the air as it passes in when one has a cold the and the bone too swell up and close the nares loss of the sense of smell in a bad cold may be due to such and the of the of that would with the sense of taste part of the bone is removed to enlarge the passage enough being left to warm the air lastly there is the bone or lower jaw this has a body and two rami one at either end each ramus has a pointed process in front called the process into which is the muscle at the back and from the process by the sigmoid notch is the condyle which with the glenoid fossa on the bone the rami also give to the muscle at its point of in adult age the ramus is almost but in old age the portion of the jaw out into alveoli for the teeth becomes and pg the angle of the jaw becomes very obtuse on the inner side of the jaw near the middle on either side is the fossa for the gland while the gland lies in a fossa farther back on either side the lower jaw is and when once this has it is liable to occur again the pg chapter iv the organs of special sense the nose the organ of the sense of smell is of a of bones and the bridge being formed by the two nasal bones and the septum by the vomer and the it of two parts the nose and the or nasal fossæ which open to the face by the nares or and into the pharynx by the nares it is covered with skin with mucous the fossæ have the bones along their outer walls and are divided into three parts known as the the middle and the meatus the middle one with the antrum of while into the meatus the canal empties there are many small muscles of which little use is pg made in forced as in where every aid to is called into play even the alæ nasi or are made to exert what power they possess in order to supply more air fig —the nasal cavity after sobotta not only is most of the air in through the nose and warmed in its passage through but the nose is the organ of smell and by means of the of its nerves the lungs against gases and helps the taste the or first cranial nerves after from the brain lie on the under surface of the frontal lobe and rest on the ethmoid bone in what is known as the tract each nerve ends in a called an bulb which rests on the plate and sends little fibers down through to be to the nasal to the upper half of the septum of the nose the roof of the nose and the and middle bones for in the mucous of the upper nasal cavity are cells called cells which play an part in the of smell hence when one wishes to smell well he sniffs it up the of smell is caused by in the being into the nose where they affect the cells which the to the nerve and so to the brain whereas a certain amount of in the nasal cavity seems to be for of smell the of too much or too little with it the mucous has a certain power also of smells at the same time though this power varies greatly in people one smell often wholly all others the below the bridge of the nose is in and cancer and lupus often begins on the nose of the septum may occlude all air from one side of the nose an effect also by polypi of the pg bone either is easily though may be serious in adults the mouth is of great as an for fresh air to the lungs when the nasal are for any reason impeded and as the chamber from which the voice man’s chief means of with his fellows its chief value may be said however to reside in the fact that it is the of the canal it is an ovoid cavity lined with mucous and is bounded in front by the lips at the sides by the cheeks below by the floor and tongue and above by the hard palate and by the soft palate the uvula from the latter like a curtain between the mouth and the pharynx shape is given to the mouth by the bones of the upper and lower jaw and its size is altered by the and raising of the latter which is quite freely movable fig —the hyoid bone toldt at the back of the mouth at the to the pharynx are the and pillars of the fauces which contain tissue and between which on either side are thick masses of tissue the tonsils the floor of the mouth is formed largely by the tongue which fills the space within the pg lower teeth its base or root is and and is by muscles to the hyoid bone and the lower jaw the hyoid bone being a bone lying just below and as it were within the the base of the tongue is also to the and at the sides to the soft palate by the pillars except at its base and the part of its under surface the tongue is free but a fold of mucous the frenum holds it in front thus it great of motion and serves as an in and the in either jaw are the teeth for the first of the food for through tearing and the which are in front have wide sharp edges for cutting the food next come the canine teeth with a sharp point for tearing it while at the back are the molars with a broad flat top for there are two sets of teeth the or milk teeth twenty in two canines and four molars in each appear at from six months to two years and the teeth in two canines known as eye teeth in the upper jaw and as stomach teeth in the lower jaw four so called because they have two cusps where the molars have four or five and six molars in each come from the sixth to the years the first to appear are the two lower middle which come at the age of six months the last to appear are the wisdom teeth the back of the molars which come at the age of years or each tooth of a crown or body above the gum a neck and a fang or root within the gum the body is of dentine or ivory with a thin crust of enamel and the pulp a tissue many nerves at the neck and the fang is a layer of cement or true bonepg the sense of sense of taste lies chiefly in the taste buds as they are called which are filled with cells and are found in the papillæ of the tongue in the papillæ at the back of the tongue which are few in number and in a vshape there is also a certain power of taste in the tip and sides of the tongue but little in the upper surface or dorsum only five special tastes can be bitter sweet acid sour and salt but more than one can be at a time as bitter and sweet every one can between tastes but the power varies in people and with certain tastes seem to be better in certain places as sweet at the tip and bitter at the back of the tongue the sense of taste is very upon the sense of smell in the case of and savory which one really does not taste but smell if one held his nose and closed his eyes he would not know from the taste whether he was eating onion or apple this leads to the habit of the nose when taking to be tasted a must be in against the tongue lips or cheek the sense of taste a of ° favors taste while both great heat and great cold impair it there are at least two nerves of taste the lingual branch of the or fifth cranial and the branch of the along with the sense of taste there are other senses in the mouth which play an part such as and the sense of heat and cold and it is often hard to them from the pure of taste which indeed is always by them either side of the mouth are three glands for the of the saliva which serves to soften and the food and to digest by means of its pg ferment ptyalin the parotid gland is the largest and is below and in front of the ear opening by duct the gland is below the jaw toward the back on either side and its duct is duct the gland lies beneath the mucous of the floor of the mouth and opens by eight to twenty tiny ducts beside the frenum the ducts of rivinus the of the glands depends upon the blood supply; the more blood the greater their fig of the side of the face showing the glands a gland; b gland with its duct opening on the floor of the mouth beneath the tongue at d; c parotid gland and its duct which opens on the inner side of the cheek after yeo the tonsils vary in size and in swell and may even meet in the median line they are removed when they are one often gets a third tonsil or a growth at the back of the pharynx which causes by day and snoring by night a child with is starved for air and what air is in is not warmed the growth should be removed a short frenum which may be by cancer of the tongue is fairly common and a radical in mumps the parotid glands are and the ear—the special organ of hearing is the ear to which there are three parts the the middle and the ear the ear of the pinna or portion for the and of sound waves and the canal partly partly bone which is forward inward and and conveys sound to the middle ear fig —the small bones of the ear; view after gray the middle ear or is an cavity in the petrous portion of the bone its outer wall is formed by the tympani or drum an oval placed at the bottom of the canal the middle ear with the inner ear through the ovalis or oval window and the the malleus or hammer the incus or anvil and the stapes or stirrup which are in a movable chain from the drum to the oval window the malleus which is with the tympani by its head with the body of the incus while the stapes with the incus by its head and is by its base with the margin of the oval window is made between the middle ear and the pharynx and the of the air

some other reason they become stopped up and trouble results in the middle ear some of the mastoid cells also connect with the middle ear and may become causing mastoid disease fig view of left bony after removal of the and walls the and or canals; fovea fovea common opening of the and canals; opening of the of the opening of the of the the scala scala the lamina and from quain after the ear of various out in the petrous portion of the bone there is an osseous of a central cavity known as the three canals and the cochlea and within the osseous by is the of like form filled with the exists with the middle ear by the round and oval windows and with the canal through which passes the eighth cranial or nerve the special nerve of hearing which is to the inner ear only when the nerve enters the ear through this meatus it divides into two pg of which one goes to the and the other to the organ of corti a group of cells in the cochlea of the which is very in the to the brain the nerve also breaks up into very small and is the wall of the the of hearing is the result of to the nerve and so to the center in the brain it is caused by sound waves which travel through the air from their point of origin and enter the ear this and selects the waves of sound and helps one to a certain extent to the from which the sound comes as they pass through the meatus the sound waves are into a small area for to the middle ear where by means of the drum they set in the chain of through these the are in turn to the oval window being in the process here again they are taken up by the from which they pass through the wall of the to the the lining of the in such a way that the are to the nerve more in the from which the enter the cochlea they also affect the cells of the organ of corti in like manner as they pass from the to the the that covers the rotunda or round window relaxes and expands as the strike it thus serving to the shock of impact musical sounds are caused by or while give rise to noises in musical sounds is by the height or of the pitch by the length of the wave and quality by the number of so called partial tones a of sound cannot be by pg less than a second and the person cannot hear more than a second sounds can be when they follow each other as closely as by one of a second all sound does not come through the canal of the ear the bones of the head vibrate and carry sound so there are for the deaf which are put in the ear and others which are placed between the teeth the canals are not to hearing but have to do with a power of his injury to them may cause and loss of the eye—one more feature perhaps the most remains to be the eye the senses are all of the and the nerve of sight is no more to light than any other nerve it needs an end organ that is to the motions of the ether in order to give of light this organ is in the eye which is not only itself capable of being moved in every but is placed in the most movable part of the body the head which can be turned in almost a circle the eyeball is and lies in the cavity of the orbit upon a cushion of fat where it has a large range of sight but is from injury by its bony the sunken eyes illness are due to the using by the system of the fat on which the eyeball rests each orbital cavity is formed by the of some seven bones and with the cavity of the brain through the optic foramen and through the fissure above the orbits are arched of skin the from which several rows of short hairs grow and which serve to protect the eyes and to limit the amount of light to a certain extent as in still further is by the eyelids folds of skin the one above the other below which close like over the eye beneath the layer of skin in the lids is fatty tissue and then the muscle by means of which they are closed they are kept in shape by the tarsal plates or in whose ocular surface are the glands whose the free edges of the lids from along these edges grows a double or triple row of stiff hairs the which curve outward so as not to with each other and also to prevent the into the eye of foreign bodies lining the inner surface of the lids and thence over the surface of the coat of the eye is a mucous the which is thick opaque and on the lids but thin and on the eyeball the angles between the lids are known as the and the canthus fig —the ocular muscles pyle muscles and eyeball is held in by the ocular muscles the and the lids while it yet free is a thin sac the tunica oculi the and recti muscles at the upper and lower edges of the ball turn the eye up pg and down; the and recti at the inner and outer edges turn the eye inward and and the and oblique rotate the eye the nerves these muscles are the third or motor oculi the fourth and the sixth the gland which is about the size and shape of an almond is at the upper and outer part of the orbit it a fluid which keeps the surface of the eye bathed in and is drained away through the sac in the inner canthus whence it passes by the ducts into the nose when the amount is it the lower lid as tears fig of the pyle coats of eye—the or coats of the eye are three in number an outer or a middle or and an inner or the coat is a rather thick fibrous where it passes in front of the iris however it is thinner and and is known as the cornea the cornea and as it were a segment of a smaller sphere set into the rest of the the middle or coat known as the choroid carries for the retina or coat in its inner layer and has an outer layer of pigment cells that light and darkens the inner chamber of the eye the folds of the choroid at its pg margin contain the ciliary muscles and are known as the ciliary while the name iris is given to the little round muscle just in front of the lens the surface of the iris is covered with a thick layer of pigment cells to prevent the of light except through the central opening or pupil and its surface also has pigment cells that give it its color though the in the color of eyes is due rather to the amount of pigment present than to its color a small amount of pigment being present in blue eyes and a large amount in brown and black eyes in the size of the pupil are brought about by of the and fibers of the iris of the fibers making it smaller and those of the larger the pupil is for near objects and during sleep and is dilated for distant objects in a dull light also it dilates to let in more light and in a bright light it the of the pupil is often as a means of and in fig section through the eyeball and eyelids pyle lastly there is the coat or retina which has eight layers the outer one some pigment cells and the next pg the rods and cones in which the power of is to lie of the optic nerve being over it in all in fact the retina is formed by a of the optic or second cranial nerve the special nerve of sight which passes into the orbit through the optic foramen at the back and enters the eyeball close to the macula lutea or yellow spot the exact spot where the optic nerve enters the retina is not and is known as the blind spot in the center of the macula lutea however which is in the middle of the retina is a tiny pit the fovea in which all the layers of the retina except the rods and cones are absent and at this point vision is most perfect it is always turned toward the object looked at and when one wishes to see an object he must keep moving his eyes over it that the rays from each part may fall in turn upon the fovea behind the pupil is the lens a rather firm body in a capsule which is in life but opaque in death the lens is doubly convex and is held in place by the which arise from the ciliary in front of it is the chamber of the eye filled with a thin watery fluid called the aqueous humor while the larger space back of it about of the entire globe is filled with a known as the humor the chief artery of the eye is the light eye is a camera and its is to reflect images there are several and media for the cornea alone need be except for those rays which enter the eye to the cornea whose line of is called the optic axis all rays are when they enter the eye and the point at which they meet and cross each other behind the cornea is called the focus of the eye to focus all the rays from any one point pg on an object must meet again in a common point upon the retina their focus in the normal eye all the rays from an object are focused on the retina and form upon it an image of the object which as in the camera is because of the of the rays behind the cornea once focused on the retina the light the various layers to the layer of rods and cones where action takes place and affects the little of the optic nerve by which the message is carried to the brain fig showing the between a b myopic and c eyes of when the eye is at rest the pupil and lens are in their normal pg and at such times the eye sees only distant objects the ability of the eye to focus upon objects at is called and to it three things are change in the shape of the lens; of the axes of the eyes and of the pupils when the eye is toward distant objects the muscle fibers in the ciliary relax causing of the and of the surface of the lens an image would be formed in front of the retina; for the greater the of the lens the greater the angle of such is passive and so not to look at nearby objects on the the ciliary muscles drawing the choroid forward and the to relax so that the lens bulges in front this is an in order to both eyes must work and the axes of both eyes must be toward the object in looking at nearby objects the axes of the eyes drawn by the recti muscles in or cross eye where the axes of both eyes cannot be toward the object at the same time the rays fall upon one part of one eye and upon a part of the other eye and two images are seen finally there is of the pupil by of the fibers of the iris by which means various side rays that would come to a focus outside the retina are all the muscles of the ciliary muscles the recti and the pupillæ are under the control of the third nerve with this power of and on it are the two of or myopia and or the normal eye is and is almost but in pg the or myopic eye the ball instead of being round is from above down and so bulges in front owing to the greater from the lens to the retina images are formed in front of the retina only nearby objects can be seen clearly because the farther the object from the eye the farther in front of the retina the image is formed concave glasses are worn to enable people to see at a or eyes are from before and can see only objects at a clearly as those nearby form images behind the retina for such eyes convex glasses are worn as the person middle life he becomes able to see better at a than near to this as it is called which is is due to a partial loss of the power of in the lens the result of a general loss of in the parts another very common defect is a failure of the rays to focus upon a point owing to a in the surface of the cornea color is also an of the eye the waves of ether when of a certain rate of give the of heat and when their are more rapid they give the of light each of the primary colors of the gives off a pretty number of light rays which travel through the air and enter the eye the number of rays the color thrown upon the retina and the the of the color when light is passing through into the eye it is broken up as in a prism and the person gets a as of all sorts of colors total or partial absence of to color is called color it is in the form of to between red and green and is due to a defect in the a hair on the lid becomes and a sty is formed pink eye is or of the a duct may become stopped and cause bulging or there may be a sagging down or ptosis of the upper lid in certain as and more rodent ulcer often begins by the eye or on the cheek pg chapter v the nervous system the nervous system which all the vital of the body and and which is partly in the head and partly in the trunk may well form the link between the of the head and that of the trunk it has two the system and the system the former of the or brain proper the or little brain the pons varolii the medulla the spinal cord and the cranial and spinal nerves; the latter of a series of ganglia or of nerve centers the brain which the pons and medulla the cranium and the spinal cord is within the bony of the spinal column in the male the brain weighs about ounces and in the female while in an idiot it seldom weighs more than ounces the or brain proper has two parts or roughly oval in shape each of which has five lobes by the frontal and lobes and the central lobe or island of reil at the base of the brain the chief are the fissure the fissure of sylvius at the base of the brain and the fissure of rolando between the frontal and lobes there are also five serous called the two lateral and the third fourth and fifth of which the first two one in either are the most around these is the brain which is made up of two tissues the white and the gray the latter pg forming the outer part of the brain to the depth of perhaps half an inch and the white matter forming the rest the outer or gray part is called the cortex and is largely made up of nerve cells it might be called the active part of the brain the white part largely of nerve fibers which are given off from the nerve cells and are carried down into the spinal cord the surface of the brain is the ridges being by deep furrows or sulci by which means a great extent of gray matter is secured the furrows contain fluid from the spaces and vary in number and depth to while the are not uniform in all brains the ones are both the brain and the spinal cord are covered by three the dura mater the and the pia mater the dura mater is dense and fibrous and lines the of the skull being firmly to it at many points in fact it the of the cranial bones the is a serous with two layers to prevent which divides the space between the dura mater and the pia mater over the and the and spaces which are with and contain a serous the fluid this fluid forms an elastic water cushion on which the brain rests and the pia mater is and nerves and is closely to the surface of the brain dipping down into all the sulci at the base or under surface of the brain are some very the bulbs lie beneath the frontal lobe and back is the tract through which the nerves come from the brain back of the tract is the optic where the optic nerves coming from the brain cross each other and back of the again is the optic tract where the pg optic nerves emerge from the brain at

sinuses formed by the of the dura mater into two layers the is about the size of the and weighs about ounces it lies in the lower fossæ of the skull and is oblong in shape and divided into two lateral by a fissure it is made up of both white and gray matter of which the former the gray being as in the the cells are about the same as in the cortex and its surface is by queer furrows of its little is known but it plays a most part in the of the nervous and acts by which the of the body are carried on at the back of the and below the is the pons varolii which forms a link with the medulla or bulging part of the cord it is made up of white matter or nerve fibers though there is a small amount of gray matter in which are found the nuclei of some of the cranial nerves in the medulla which is about inch long and extends from the pons varolii to the upper border of the atlas or first the gray matter is not to the white but is found in patches in the white the gray matter here more or less to that of the spinal cord and the white matter is with that of the cord from the medulla arise the fifth to twelfth cranial nerves and the nerves the cardiac nerve has its center here and here too are the centers of pg and in the medulla the nerves that arise in the cross over from one side of the body to the other on the crossed tracts the of this of the nerve fibers is seen in when a is in

primary branch seen in a and d to be derived in part from the and in part from the root allen thomson if a of the cord is made it is found to have a pretty it is roughly and is divided by certain of which the most are the and median the latter being rather a line or septum by them it is divided into halves by a small band in the middle called the the white matter is to the gray and is divided by it into four columns which again are divided into tracts to certain groups of nerves that travel through them the most tract is the direct tract in the column the gray matter is in the form of a letter h of two lateral halves more or less in outline by a narrow band the gray each half is divided into two horns the toward the front of the cord and the toward the back the former being much thicker and heavier than the latter the of the gray and pg of the white matter is the same as in the brain but the varies in parts of the cord the white in the region and the gray being much better in the lumbar region where the nerve cells for control of the lower occur the gray is least well in the dorsal region through the center of the cord runs a small hole or canal filled with fluid the central canal of the cord fig areas of the cortex left a a stevens the brain is the seat of and will the center of all action change in some part of the is the of every of indeed the brain is never in a state of repose there being dreams even during sleep the brain is not to injury in the sense of pain it can be without much pain various centers exist in the brain of which the most perhaps is the motor center the visual center is in the lobe pg the center in the lobe the speech center in the third left frontal thus the of the senses have been located though the of many parts the so called silent areas are still in the motor center that is the center for motion of the muscles is about the fissure of rolando and is divided into three parts one for the legs one for the face and one for the arms the one for the legs being and the others below in the order fibers from these cells extend down through the brain and cord to the muscles the fibers being into bundles and the whole known as the motor tract there may be one long fiber from a cell in the brain down through most of the cord or there may be a of shorter fibers that are not but are in close contact with each other in the upper pons the fibers for the face cross to the side while the rest keep on down through the medulla and as they emerge from the medulla they too cross to the other side and keep on down in the crossed tract a few fibers do not cross but come down the direct tract which however part way down the crossed tract is the true motor tract and in it the fibers are sending to the cells in the gray matter where they connect with the horn the anatomy of the sensory tract is not so well by it are sent to the brain by the organs the surface of the body the sensory fibers connect with the sensory cells in the horn from which fibers are sent to the brain the reverse of motor action there are three chief sensory tracts which are to one pain one and the third of touch all these tracts of which the chief is the direct tract in passing up the cord pass to the side at levels and then go on to the cortex of the brainpg the action of the nerves is similar to reflex action only that an effort of will is needed to send an impulse from the brain it is by the help of the brain along this line that an of or habits is for which is needed in the but which are later done herein lie the of all the brain and spinal cord work the cord acting as a medium between the brain in which all the higher such as will thought etc and the the cord however has some action of the brain as is seen in reflex action this action is so that the cord is spoken of as the seat of action called reflex action all acts are reflex acts as when the hand is drawn away from a hot iron if an impulse is sent along one of the sensory fibers it enters the cord through the horn where its nerve cell is found then through some between the nerve cell of the sensory fiber and that of the motor fiber the impulse is to the motor cell and another impulse is sent out of the cord along the motor fiber of the nerve to the muscle one of the is the reflex action is because the are with delayed or in the time for a reflex act is very brief that for the being about three of a second the nerves of the head known as the cranial nerves arise from the brain while the rest of the body is by the spinal nerves which come off at from the spinal cord the cranial nerves consist of twelve pairs the or nerve of smell the optic or nerve of sight the motor oculi the which the eye the or a nerve of general motion and taste the a motor nerve the pg facial nerve of the face ear palate and tongue the or nerve of hearing the nerve of and taste the or vagus which is both motor and sensory and governs the heart and the stomach the spinal to the muscles of the soft palate and the the motor nerve to the tongue the spinal nerves also are in pairs eight pairs twelve dorsal or five lumbar five sacral and one these titles their point of origin near the of the same name each of these nerves arises by two roots an motor root from the horn of gray matter and a sensory root from the horn the latter having a upon it after from the cord the two roots unite to form the nerve that the nerve may contain both motor and sensory fibers the motor fibers are called because they carry from the cord while the sensory are called because they carry back to the cord after leaving the cord the nerves unite to form which again divide into various nerve trunks and are to the muscles the first nerves pass out of the spinal column above the first and the other nerves below that and the while the other spinal nerves emerge each below the as the first dorsal below the first dorsal etc after they break up into a large and a small the the spine and the dorsal muscles and skin the the rest of the trunk and the limbs the plexus is formed by the of the first four nerves the plexus by the last four and the first dorsal or nerves the lumbar plexus by the four upper lumbar and the sacral plexus by the last lumbar and the four upper sacral the only branch of any of the four upper nerves which in general supply the neck and is the phrenic

great sciatic the largest nerve in the body and the small sciatic which go to the and thigh the great sciatic runs down the back of the thigh and divides at the pg lower third of the thigh into the and nerves the former of which passes along the back of the thigh to the knee where it becomes the tibial which in turn divides at the ankle into the and plantar the pg along the outer side of the space and divides an inch below the head of the fibula into the tibial which the flexors and skin of the and the which sends to the skin of the lower leg and the dorsum of the foot the to the system by cords is the system this is made up of two series of ganglia one on either side of the spinal column by bands and from the base of the skull to the coccyx they do not form an nervous system each which seems to the motor cells of the spinal cord being by motor and sensory fibers with the system the nerves are mostly gray fibers and are to viscera glands and whose are and obtuse they form upon the heart and other viscera and send to the cranium to the organs of special sense there are three main the solar plexus behind the stomach which the the plexus in front of the of the sacrum whose nerves go to the pelvic organs; and the cardiac plexus behind the aortic arch for the viscera over these nerves one has no control a blow in the region between the costal and below the sternum is a solar plexus blow and is very the system serves to in all the of the system and one of its is to keep up between one part and another so that when any organ is the others will act and help out to the best of their ability pg chapter vi the back fig — the spinal column church and the trunk may be roughly divided into the back the chest or thorax the abdomen and the pelvis by the back is denoted the spinal column with its muscles etc and the spinal cord already the spine or column which serves the double purpose of holding the body erect and of the cord is usually about two feet two inches in length in its course there occur several curves which serve to give and and with the to the force of from blows and falls the curve is convex forward in the region convex in the dorsal forward in the lumbar and again in the sacral region there is most freedom of motion in the region as is the case with the other bones the are adapted in shape and size to the needs they are called upon to fill and with a minimum bulk a channel for the cord and for the nerves and are some of the which in they meet to an degree they are in all and are divided into groups to the region in which they occur seven in the neck twelve dorsal or five lumbar five sacral and four the of the groups differ more or less in size and shape in with the various demands of their they all have certain general each has a body two laminæ two two and one spinous process the extend back from the body on either side and support two broad plates of bone the laminæ whose at the back the spinal foramen for the passage of the cord at their is the spinous process which can be felt beneath the skin while the project from the of the laminæ with the all the are for the of muscles that move the spine the body is formed of bone with a compact layer outside it is oval while its upper and lower are flat except in the region where the upper surface is concave and the under convex and concave from before back between the bodies are disks of which motion and the spinous process or spine is short in the region long and in the dorsal region thick and almost out in the lumbar region the are notched above and below so that pg when the notches of two join to form the foramen for the outward passage of nerves and the inward passage of the mark of the is the foramen in each process through which the run to the skull they are also smaller than the dorsal and lumbar the dorsal are by having on the and on the body smooth called facets and for with the ribs the lumbar are the largest and and have the spine by the time the sacral region is reached however the have only a spinous process in adult age the sacral bones grow and form one bone the sacrum which has a broad base called the of the sacrum and a blunt apex it is concave in front and convex behind and has an surface for joining the pelvic bones in the case of the coccyx also the four bones all in and to be the of a tail grow to form one bone the sacrum and coccyx form the wall of the true pelvis fig —a type of leidy body; lamina; spinal spinous process fig —the sacrum from before drawn by d gunn pg some of the dorsal are in the of their facets and while among the are several whose should be more noted thus the first or atlas the head and has no body the place of the body being taken by a narrow arch of bone and an opening with the spinal foramen into which the process of the axis fits being held in place by at either side on top is a facet for with the bone there is almost no spine the second or axis has the body the process with a facet in front for with the atlas and one behind for the to move over the seventh or has a very long spinous name—to which is the nuchæ it can be felt very on the living running from the skull down through the spinal column into the sacral and formed by the joining of the spinal of the is an opening called the spinal canal which holds the cord the cord however stops at the first lumbar where it splits up into the cauda equina only the filum farther down the laminæ do not form and the of the cord may bulge out and form a tumor or the cord itself may come out also this occurs in the lumbar region where it is known as spina bifida if in case of of a there is of the parts below due simply to the of a of bone upon the cord it may be cured by removal of the if however the cord suffers injury the will remain or pott’s

ribs are in number twelve on each side of which the upper seven which with the sternum by are called true ribs the other five false ribs of the false ribs the upper three with the sternum through the seventh with which their unite while the other two have their free and are pg called ribs all the ribs slope down toward the front and are by nature more freely movable in women than in men most of the ribs have a head divided by a little ridge into two facets for with the dorsal a neck a at the base of the neck with a facet for with the process of the below an angle and a shaft which is convex and is grooved on its lower edge for the vessels and nerve the first and second and twelfth ribs however are the first two being shorter flatter and rather broader than the rest and the first having only one facet on the head while the last two have only one facet on the head and no neck or the costal serve to prolong the ribs and greatly the of the chest wall they grow longer down to the seventh

of the heart upon its axis during of the muscle it beats and a person does at a rate of about to the minute in the adult to the regular cardiac cycle as it is called there are two periods the systole and the the former the period of of the when the blood is sent to the lungs and over the body and the latter the period of rest the of the during which they are of the heart of the time of one beat and the pause there are really two one of the and one of the but they come so close that they are so far as sound is though they can be by sight during systole the and mitral valves close sharply to prevent pg into the while the valves open to let the blood out the cardiac cycle is as follows fig of the after kirke blood after it has given off its oxygen and carbon dioxide returns to the heart through two main the and venæ cavæ the former the blood from the upper part of the body the head neck and arms and the latter from the lower part below the the two vessels empty along with the sinus which is guarded by the valve into the right auricle at the same time that they empty into this auricle the four veins the only veins that carry or blood are the fresh blood pg from the lungs into the left auricle when both are full they and send the blood into the the systole as the blood comes through into the it comes around by the walls and closes the valves though just how the valves close is not certain when the two are full they in turn the systole and the blood is forced out that in the right passing to the lungs for its new supply of oxygen through the artery the only artery to carry venous blood and that from the left the aorta for general through the body the systole is a pause the while the heart fills again fig —the fetal in the fetus there is direct between the two through the foramen ovale which closes at birth though it remains open there is also between the artery and the arch of the aorta through the ductus the freshly blood comes to the fetus through the from which it is brought along the cord in the vein to the liver and thence to the vena cava where it mixes with the blood from the lower by the vena cava it is carried to the right auricle where the valve—a valve between the vena cava and the opening larger in the fetus than in later life where it serves no special it across the auricle and through the foramen ovale to the left auricle from this auricle with a small amount of blood from the lungs it goes to the left and is by the aorta almost pg to the head and upper hence their large size and perfect at birth from the upper by the vena cava the blood enters the right auricle again and passing over the valve this time to the right from which the greater part passes by the artery and the ductus to the aorta though a small amount keeps on through the artery to the lungs in the aorta it mixes with the blood from the left and part goes to supply the lower though the greater part is carried back to the through the two the fact that the greater part of the blood the liver for its large size at birth while the lower which receive for the most part blood that has already through the upper are of small size and birth the blood for the general leaves the heart by the aorta the main artery of the body through this and its it is carried the body in what with the return of the venous blood by the venæ cavæ and other smaller veins is known as the the aorta ascends from the left and arches to the left over the root of the left lung to descend along the spinal column at the left to the fourth lumbar about the where in size by the it has given off it divides into the two common iliacs for its parts are named to their the aorta the arch of the aorta and the aorta the last being into the and the aorta fig —the aortæ and their leidy

the mammary with to the chest walls and such as the and and the at the lower border of the first rib over which it passes the name is for while at the lower border of the axilla where it starts down the arm it is called the artery at the elbow the divides into the radial and ulnar pg the artery sends to the chest and and is more injured than any other artery except the may occur in it and is very likely to occur in the aorta from the aorta go to various of the chest while the aorta the viscera among the of the aorta are the celiac axis which has a gastric an hepatic and a splenic branch; the and to the the renal; the the or the and the lumbar the common iliacs divide at the upper edge of the sacrum into the and iliacs of which the latter with its the walls and viscera of the pelvis and the inner part of the thigh the iliac and its go to the thigh leg and foot the veins few need be by name the deep veins have the same names as the they though there are two veins where there is only one artery the and jugular veins on either side joining to form an vein and the two in turn forming the vena cava of the veins the and jugular to the common carotid and return the blood from the head and face the jugular vein is because it is the largest vein in the neck and is often cut in suicide the median vein is found at the bend of the elbow and is used in letting blood and in giving salt while the basilic is on the inner side and the median on the outer side of the upper arm often occurs in the or long and the or short in the leg the vena cava is formed by the of the two common iliac veins portal portal system of veins four pg large trunks which collect the blood from the viscera of the and veins from the the splenic vein from the spleen and the gastric from the stomach these join to form the portal vein the only vein that breaks up into this divides and through the liver whence it emerges as the hepatic veins the whole is known as the portal the and its vessels a few words might also be said the artery which carries the blood from the right to the lungs is only about two inches long and divides into a right and a left artery which pierce the and go to their lungs the right one is the larger and longer for it has farther to go and gives off a branch to supply the third lobe of the right lung the vessels finally divide and in the the venous then gather to form a main vein in each lobule these veins uniting into two trunks for each lung the veins which empty into the left auricle nerves of fibers of the heart have the power of nerve centers or ganglia are also found in the walls and the of the heart the thus in some of the lower animals the heart can be removed from the body and if placed in normal salt will go on beating for some time the heart is however by two nerves the vagus or and the of these the vagus is the it acts as a check and makes the heart’s action regular and if it is cut the action of the heart becomes very rapid and the is the when the vagus alone is it first slows then stops the heart for it weakens the systole and follows of the pg both the and the force of the beat being when a person faints from a blow in the abdomen it is because the is and the action of the heart the work of the heart is very upon its nervous and of the heart are wholly due to nervous heart the two heart sounds may be heard they are known as the first and second sounds the first is a soft rushing sound and louder than the other and is caused in part by the of the muscle itself when the blood is forced out and in part by the closure of the valves the second sound is shorter and sharper a snap and is caused by the closure of the valves when the of the ceases and they begin to refill in certain where the edges of the valves are they do not snap and the sound varies from the normal the heart rate of the heart beat is to the size of the person and in as the size if the ear is placed over the abdomen of a woman the heart of the fetus can be heard beating very rapidly in labor it may become more rapid or very faint and warn the doctor that should be done the usual rate of the pulse in the fetus is to times a minute though it varies with size and sex at birth it drops to to ; for the first year it is to ; for the second year to ; for the third year to ; from the seventh to the years to ; from the to the years to ; from to sixty to in old age it rises a little and is to the rate is higher in the average woman than in the average man and with with of and in high where the is less at each beat of the heart from four to six ounces of blood are pg into the artery and the aorta and in or beats all the blood in the body passes through the heart the power exerted by the heart every minute in thus driving the blood upon its course has been as to raise its own weight of a pound the height of the or meters; for the have to force the blood into vessels already full factors are three main factors in the the systole which gives the blood its first the in the which serves to hold it in check slowing the and doing away with its and the of the walls of the if a is tied about an artery there is a on the side toward the heart while in the case of a vein the is on the side away from the heart that is the is in either case on the side from which the blood comes when an artery is cut however the blood comes out in spurts though from a cut vein it oozes slowly and for the blood is pumped out by the heart and its beating against the walls of the artery is felt in the pulse which follows after the beat of the heart itself the pulse is due to the fact that the vessels into which the blood is forced are already full this causes a local at the of the artery which passes with force along its entire length the being due to the fact that more force is needed to drive the blood through the small and than to stretch the elastic walls of the aorta and the large it is this elastic of the that makes the blood flow for the blood would come in jets as it is pumped from the heart the elastic walls of the vessels however offer a certain to the pumping of the fluid through them and at the same time by between whiles allow a certain amount of fluid to be in them so that they full and the flow pg is more or less the outlet also helps to make the flow by the time the blood reaches the veins its has been done away with but though there are no elastic walls in the veins it still has force enough after the slowing in the to return to the heart in this it is aided to a certain extent by the valves and by the action of the muscles as they and expand in the arms and legs where the blood runs and there is a high column to be there are also more veins than each large artery having two large veins the venæ comites to help get the blood back to the heart and the veins freely thus if the blood cannot get back by one channel it does by another in parts like the brain where it is very that there should be no since any of would lead to serious results the vessels are in thick walls and in the liver through which all the blood passes and where is sure to cause trouble the veins are simply caverns carved out in the organ and have no walls they lie open when the organ is opened veins are the result of valves giving way through or disease so that others have an unduly large weight to support the pulse wave is by a quick rise and a slow fall though this cannot be by the finger in some slow fevers however the fall is very long and ripples can be felt this is known as the pulse with age the walls grow stiffer and more rigid and less adapted to their work in certain cases of heart disease the heart does not all the beats to the pulse and to get the true rate the heart must be to the rate at which the pulse wave travels varies with the size of the artery and the force of the heart beat but is about to feet a second the flow is most rapid in the because they are nearest pg the heart where the is and slowest in the where the area is the area of the known as the area because it is from the heart being larger than that of the large thus of flow varies with and with area blood are and exert on the walls of the tubes through which they pass the amount of depends upon the inflow and outflow with the inflow and with the outflow that is the smaller the outlet the greater the and vice versa the is also nearest to the inflow and with until at the point of outflow there is no so in the the blood is in the large vessels nearer the heart and as they branch into smaller and smaller vessels in passing through the owing to their small size and the blood meets with more the and this usually the in the the greater the as a rule the greater the the in the is very slight and in the veins there is no in fact in the large veins near the heart the is and the blood is almost sucked into the heart then is in the and least in the veins while the rate of flow is fastest in the to a slowest in the a a little faster again in the veins— a second blood is gauged by opening a vessel and a the being by the height to which the mercury is raised in man the in the is to pg it is during by the of the lungs on the heart and great vessels in the is true when the blood is high the pulse is small and travels fast because the wall of the artery is already highly such a pulse is hard and a large pulse occurs where the heart is strong and the is low owing to a pulse is soft and if the heart beat is weak a slow pulse is than a rapid one the nerve supply of the comes from the spinal cord through the nerves which are with the system and are to the smooth muscle fibers of the vessels they are of two classes the which the lumen of the vessels and the which the size of the vessels by these nerves the general tone of the is kept up they are chiefly to vessels in the skin and in the organs and the are the more when the are three occur flow through the vessel due to its size; general and flow through the other when the are the effect is the flow through the vessel is there is and there is flow through the other the palor of fright is due to the action of the nerves of the face and to the action of the heat the so that more blood goes to the skin begins and the body is cooled by cold the and the blood is kept within the body where it cannot cool if a part has too much blood an impulse passes by the to lessen the supply while if pg more blood is needed a message goes to the central nervous system and an impulse passes by the to flush the organ the more active a part is in the greater the number of except in the brain which has only large vessels the vessels of the contain much blood and are capable of all the blood in the body the blood itself which thus through the body to the tissues and waste is a complex fluid of a bright red color its amount has been to be about of the body weight of it is in the heart lungs and large and veins in the liver in the muscles and through the other organs if there is too little blood the vital cannot go on as they should while too great a supply causes rather than so the is to keep the amount and any blood added is of and any blood lost is in it is the last tissue to be used up for on it the life of the other tissues depends the blood is the same in all and the same but in passing through certain organs certain are added to or taken from it so that its changes more or less thus it varies in in parts of the body as in the liver and kidneys it has five main the of fuel from the tract to the tissues or force the of oxygen to the the of or tissue the of

stringy elastic and and certain salts of lime and upon whose its power of depends the of blood differs in people and is so little as to make the most for is that of the body extreme heat it and cold it that the blood does not clot in the body must be due to some between the blood and the walls of the and veins that it just as the walls of the stomach are not by the juices though pg does not take place in the body it does take place when a is injured or when the blood comes in contact with the air a wise of nature as the would be for to go on after injury the greater the surface with which the blood comes in contact the more quickly it clots injury to the vessel wall itself is the must be cracked under extreme injury the coat of the vessel and closes it hence a wound caused by tearing is less likely to bleed than one due to cutting the valves of the heart which are covered with are the seat of fibrin bits of the fibrin thus formed giving rise to in various kinds of heart trouble or

birth the lungs are in color but in later life they are marked with patches due to the deposit in the lung tissue of of dirt in they are light spongy and highly elastic and will float in water upon owing to the air in the tissue at birth also the lungs are solid so that the first air has to between the walls of the and air sacs but after they are thus in that they are of and open to the air above from within keeps them to the full extent of the chest which is air tight they never unless of the chest wall as in causes in which case the lung into a small ball the organic used by the body as food may give up their energy they must be broken up and for this oxygen is needed the supply of oxygen for the purpose is brought to the tissues by the blood which it in the lungs and the waste product of carbon dioxide is carried off in the same manner the lungs are adapted to take in large of air and to keep up a rapid of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood this process of oxygen to the tissues and of carbon dioxide and other waste is an act though it can be and is known as or there are two periods to or the drawing pg in of air and or the of air from the lungs the former process being a little shorter than the latter a pause follows each before there is another at birth the normal rate of is but it grows slower as the child grows older being at the age of five or six while in the adult it to times a minute it is slower during sleep and more rapid during the average amount of air taken in with every is cubic inches and the minimum air space per should be cubic feet per hour is of two kinds or and chest or rib the former usually being more in men than in women because of of tight on the part of the latter as a rule however both and ribs come into play; for in which is an active the thorax becomes from before and the ribs are raised by the chiefly though the aid and out upon the widen the chest as well as deepen it the which is when relaxed becomes in and so the size of the chest from above as the chest the lungs expand the air in them becomes and more air rushes in when the lungs are full they relax and the muscles relax after their so that is a passive due largely to the elastic of lungs and muscles the air being driven out by the of the lungs heart and lung where too little oxygen is carried to the tissues dyspnœa or results and may even advance to a in which no air is in or labored the muscles are used in and the scaleni which pass from the pg of the neck to the sternum develop and become the of the ribs may also assist and even the muscles of the neck and arms may help out while in forced the muscles are called into play the glottis opens and closes as the air enters and leaves the lungs and the add their mite in the for oxygen finally there may be a muscle in the body that is not to aid the and general may result by and death air—in the lungs are not used to their full and the air used is known as tidal air in forced the lungs are filled to their fullest extent and the air then taken in in excess of the tidal air is known as air in like manner the between the air out and that out in forced is known as air the sum of these three is the vital of the lungs while beyond this there is some air that is never the or air and exit of the air is by sounds or murmurs which vary to their in the trachea the bronchi or the and are in of the lungs and bronchi when they are often called râles changes in air in passing through the nose and the rest of the tract the air is warmed to body and with after its into the lungs various changes take place in it through the of the tidal with the air thus it gives up about or per cent of its oxygen and some per cent carbon dioxide while the amount of remains about the same by its giving up more oxygen than it carbon dioxide its volume is pg exhaled air also traces of ammonia and certain organic matters the results of which give a bad odor to the breath and are more in a close room than the mere lack of oxygen or the of carbon dioxide indeed the amount of oxygen may be very much being reduced even to or per cent instead of the normal per cent without being noticed or giving rise to any bad results yet the of is very evident effect on causes changes also in the blood the venous blood being purple and the bright red this in color is due to the absence or of oxygen which is not or by the blood but forms a rather with the of the blood as the oxygen is removed in the passage of the blood through the body there results in venous blood reduced which is of a color upon to the air however it absorbs oxygen once more and resumes its scarlet color if carbon gets into the blood as in cases of gas it drives off the oxygen and forms a more stable with the whence the in a person so nervous is in three ways by the phrenic nerve to the by some fibers of the vagus or and by the center in the bulbous portion of the spinal cord injury to the center means the ceasing of and death of the center seems to depend upon the of the blood if it is well the is slow and quiet; if there is a lack of oxygen dyspnœa results certain in the blood which are rapidly burned up by the oxygen but pg which in its absence serve to the center thus the effort to get oxygen to the need of it may be stopped by the mucous of the nose as with strong ammonia from the might be here a deep by a long is

layers with fibers with those of the fibers and oblique fibers; an areolar coat and a mucous coat which when the stomach is empty is thrown into folds or rugæ and whose surface is covered with glands the gastric glands for the of the fluids the come from the celiac axis and the nerves from the and the solar plexus ulcer and cancer of the stomach are both rather common in the former there is apt to be and in the latter but the rule does not always hold in cases of ulcer there may be and even such can be from from the lungs by its acid odor and by the frothy of from the lungs there is much at the pylorus and where there is there is liable to be cancer gastric the stomach the food is churned and mixed with the gastric juices and it is also to a that drives it on to the when it comes to the

effect upon its it is formed from the sugar in the portal blood and the process some work on the part of the liver cell itself there is always some sugar in the blood which as it is used up must be made good if there it not enough in the diet the liver the from its store of is found also in the muscles in the as food for the fetus in and to a slight extent in in fact it is the form in which is

kind of action in the walls of the ureters and it is from the body by the act of which is mostly though a certain amount of nervous it the seat of this nervous is in the lumbar of the spinal cord in some nervous where there is injury to the spinal cord there is the urine is a watery many waste urea it is amber in color varying in shade with with an odor when fresh it is acid in and has a gravity

left to allow for growth of the bone as it is liable to grow again the ulna—in the forearm there are two bones the ulna and the radius of which the former is the longer the ulna is on the inner side of the forearm and its upper end forms the greater part of the pg with the humerus as most of the at the wrist is formed by the radius and the the head of the ulna is at the lower of the bone and on the outer side with the radius and below with the from its inner side the styloid process the process forms the upper and an surface the greater sigmoid cavity for with the of the humerus where it

styloid process fig —bones of the right forearm in a of toldt in the living the process of the ulna is always felt at the elbow and the border of the ulna forms the ridge down the forearm leading to the styloid process the head of the radius is felt just below the condyle and often makes a dimple in the muscles of the forearm the rest of its upper half is with muscles but the lower half is easily felt as there are only tendons over it the styloid process is felt that pg of the radius is a little lower than that of the ulna so that in cases of their is of as showing the amount of the two forearm bones are more broken than and by direct the lower being usually drawn up by the action of the flexor and muscles and a on the palmar surface of the forearm usually causes of the radius only in both cases but in of both bones there is a for to get between the so the arm is put up in splints with the hand midway between and in order to the bones as far as care must be taken not to have the bandage too tight or of the fingers may result in most of the arm it is put up bent but in of the it is put up fully as the is sure to be by the pull of the triceps in fact the is by the force of the triceps though usually its which is is due to direct the ulna is also often in the middle by direct or the styloid process may be broken of the neck or shaft of the radius is very common the most arm being that of the lower end of the radius or colles’ this and the in the leg pott’s are two of the in of the wrist the normal of the two styloid remains but in colles’ the lower often on the back of the hand making a typical called the silver fork the bones of the wrist and hand had best be before the forearm muscles are taken up as the muscles of the forearm are largely to the fingers the wrist or carpus is made up of pg eight bones in two rows of four each in the first row are the and bones on the outer side with the radius the with the of the and the in the second row in are the os magnum

left the bone will grow again pg two affect the and the and both cause of the bones muscles of the chief groups of muscles on the forearm are the flexors and on the surface and the and on the surface in general the flexors and take their origin from on or around the condyle while the and arise on or around the condyle where not stated it will be that such is their origin in a general way they may by grouped as follows surface flexors of wrist flexor carpi flexor carpi ulnaris longus flexors of fingers flexor flexor flexor of thumb flexor longus of hand radii teres surface of forearm of wrist carpi longior carpi brevior carpi ulnaris of thumb ossis primi secundi of fingers of index finger indicis of little finger minimi digiti of hand longus brevis pg of the flexors of the wrist the flexor carpi is into the base of the index and usually of the third bone the flexor carpi ulnaris into the fifth the and the bones while the longus goes to the annular of the wrist and the palmar fascia of the hand the flexor is by four tendons into the second of the fingers while the flexor arises from the upper part of the ulna and is into the last of the fingers the flexor of the thumb arises from the middle of the radius and is into the last phalanx of the thumb which joint is flexed by a muscle depends upon the origin and of the muscle all those between being thus the flexor which has its origin in part at least from the condyle and is in the second of the fingers flexes the forearm wrist and all the but the last while the flexor arising from the ulna though it flexes the wrist and fingers has no power of flexing the forearm the radii teres besides arising from the ridge rises from the process of the ulna it is into the middle of the outer surface of the radius and serves to pronate the forearm the other the is a small muscle across the radius and ulna just above their carpal it rises from the surface of the ulna and is into the border of the radius on the back of the forearm the serves to extend the forearm only being into the upper part of the surface of the ulna the of the wrist are into the bases of the various bones and have some power to extend the forearm as well as the wrist the of the thumb as their names imply go one to the bone and one to each of the pg the longest one the whole thumb the others only a part they rise from the ulna and radius not the condyle the goes to all the of all the fingers the minimi digiti to those of the little finger only and the indicis to those of the index finger the last two arising short of the condyle of the the longer one is into the styloid process of the radius while the shorter one the brevis is into the upper part of the same bone both thus serving to turn the radius on the ulna where the tendons of the various muscles pass over the wrist both front and back they are covered with a sheath and are held down by a broad which some of them the annular the strong fibrous band of the annular arches over the carpal bones in front beneath it pass the median nerve and the tendons of the flexors of the fingers and thumb the annular is of less the deep palmar fascia forms a sheath for the muscles of the hand in there occurs of the palmar fascia which draws the fingers up as is not always it is quite a serious matter the muscles of the hand itself include various and short flexor muscles of the thumb and little finger there also extend between the bones the four small muscles that aid the deep flexor seven of which four are dorsal and three palmar the dorsal arise by two heads from the sides of the bones and are into the bases of the first thus the while the palmar arising from the palmar surface of the second fourth and fifth are into the pg three first and adduct the fingers toward an line drawn through the middle finger joints of the upper joints of the upper with the of the are the most freely movable of any in the body because the hand has the finest work to do and a greater number of motions are even the wrist has much greater freedom of motion than the joint in the lower the is rather a deep joint to allow of the varied motion and has a from the margin of the glenoid fossa above to the neck of the humerus below the elbow which is a hinge joint has an and a and two lateral as is the case in all such joints the wrist has several which taken are in nature blood supply of the upper blood supply of the upper comes through the artery which on the right springs from the artery and on the left from the aortic arch it remains one trunk as far as the elbow though names have

ulnar and radial in its upper part the artery lies to the humerus but below it is in front of the bone the radial runs in a line from the middle of the elbow to the inner side of the styloid process of the radius and is much exposed to injury in the lower third of its course as when the hand is thrust through glass on it at the wrist the pulse is counted it is much smaller than the ulnar and winds around the outer side of the thumb to the palm where with the deep branch from the ulnar it forms the deep palmar arch the pg ulnar artery passes inward to the middle of the forearm and thence along its ulnar border to the palm of the hand where it divides into the deep branch and the palmar arch which the four digital from the artery go to the chest wall and the most being the two to the

due to the in of the lower limbs there is one long bone in the upper part or thigh the femur and two in the lower part or leg the tibia and fibula while over the is the patella or kneecap the ankle has seven bones and the foot like the hand the femur is the longest bone in the body being about the height of the person it toward its fellow at the knee in order to bring the near the center of gravity in walking the amount of varying with the width of the hips and the height of the person on account of the greater width of hip the to is greater in women than in men the shaft of the femur is

one of the of the and which with the hollow of the in the os upward inward and forward from the shaft the neck varying much in length and angle it is more pg in women than in men and in rickets the great weight on the bone tends to press the head down causing the known as “coxa vera” in which the neck is almost upward outward and from the shaft at the base of the neck about of an inch lower than the head and about on a pg level with the and the spine of the os pubis is the greater this large and the smaller one of the lesser which is at the lower part of the base of the neck are for the of muscles and to assist in the bone the lower of the femur is larger than the upper and is flat from before between its two large the and is a smooth in front the surface for with the patella the condyle is more in front the the latter being the longer of the two by about half an inch the at the lower end of the femur is the only one in which has begun at birth if is found there the child is known to have arrived at full term fig —bones of the lower toldt so many large muscles are to the femur that the shaft cannot be in the living unless the person is very thin and poorly the outer surface of the greater however and the can be felt a string from the spine of the ilium to the of the ischium passes in the middle just over the upper edge of the greater the line thus drawn is known as line and is of in many of the hip thus if the hip is the will be thrown above line and in the pelvis sinks and the is again above the line thigh the thigh muscles only a few need be one large muscle is the psoas magnus which has its origin on the front of the last dorsal and all the lumbar passes pg down across the brim of the pelvis and under in size and in a tendon that is into the lesser it serves to flex the thigh on the pelvis and to rotate it outward the psoas parvus rises from the last dorsal and the first lumbar and does not go out of the pelvis the or tailor muscle is flat and and is the longest muscle in the body it rises from the spine of the ilium and is into the upper inner surface of the shaft of the tibia by it the legs are crossed it also forms the outer side of an whose base is formed by and the inner side by the magnus muscle which passes from the ramus of the os pubis and the of the ischium to the linea aspera the femoral artery bisects the and runs into its apex the bulk of the portion of the thigh is formed by the which is really made up of four muscles the rectus femoris whose origin is on the iliac spine and above the the vastus which comes from the greater and the upper linea aspera; and the vastus and crureus which rise from the neck of the femur and the linea aspera it is into the of the tibia by the patellæ in which the patella lies its action is to extend the leg at the back and forming the are the three glutei muscles the gluteus maximus medius and minimus all these rise from the outer side of the ilium and have their on
