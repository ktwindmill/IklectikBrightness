the present volume may be considered as one of the consequences that have resulted from the calculating engine the construction of which i have been so long superintending having been induced during the last ten years to visit a considerable number of workshops and factories both in england and on the continent for the purpose of endeavouring to make myself acquainted with the various resources of mechanical art i was insensibly led to apply to them those principles of generalization to which my other pursuits had naturally given rise the increased number of curious processes and interesting facts which thus came under my attention as well as of the reflections which they suggested induced me to believe that the publication of some of them might be of use to persons who propose to bestow their attention on those enquiries which i have only incidentally considered with this view it was my intention to have delivered the present work in the form of a course of lectures at cambridge; an intention which i was subsequently induced to alter the substance of a considerable portion of it has however appeared among the preliminary chapters of the mechanical part of the encyclopedia metropolitana i have not attempted to offer a complete enumeration of all the mechanical principles which regulate the application of machinery to arts and manufactures but i have endeavoured to present to the reader those which struck me as the most important either for understanding the actions of machines or for enabling the memory to classify and arrange the facts connected with their employment still less have i attempted to examine all the difficult questions of political economy which are intimately connected with such enquiries it was impossible not to trace or to imagine among the wide variety of facts presented to me some principles which seemed to pervade many establishments; and having formed such conjectures the desire to refute or to verify them gave an additional interest to the pursuit several of the principles which i have proposed appear to me to have been unnoticed before this was particularly the case with respect to the explanation i have given of the division of labour; but further enquiry satisfied me that i had been anticipated by m gioja and it is probable that additional research would enable me to trace most of the other principles which i had thought original to previous writers to whose merit i may perhaps be unjust from my want of acquaintance with the historical branch of the subject the truth however of the principles i have stated is of much more importance than their origin; and the utility of an enquiry into them and of establishing others more correct if these should be erroneous can scarcely admit of a doubt the difficulty of understanding the processes of manufactures has unfortunately been greatly overrated to examine them with the eye of a manufacturer so as to be able to direct others to repeat them does undoubtedly require much skill and previous acquaintance with the subject; but merely to apprehend their general principles and mutual relations is within the power of almost every person possessing a tolerable education those who possess rank in a manufacturing country can scarcely be excused if they are entirely ignorant of principles whose development has produced its greatness the possessors of wealth can scarcely be indifferent to processes which nearly or remotely have been the fertile source of their possessions those who enjoy leisure can scarcely find a more interesting and instructive pursuit than the examination of the workshops of their own country which contain within them a rich mine of knowledge too generally neglected by the wealthier classes it has been my endeavour as much as possible to avoid all technical terms and to describe in concise language the arts i have had occasion to discuss in touching on the more abstract principles of political economy after shortly stating the reasons on which they are founded i have endeavoured to support them by facts and anecdotes; so that whilst young persons might be amused and instructed by the illustrations those of more advanced judgement may find subject for meditation in the general conclusions to which they point i was anxious to support the principles which i have advocated by the observations of others and in this respect i found myself peculiarly fortunate the reports of committees of the house of commons upon various branches of commerce and manufactures and the evidence which they have at different periods published on those subjects teem with information of the most important kind rendered doubly valuable by the circumstances under which it has been collected from these sources i have freely taken and i have derived some additional confidence from the support they have afforded to my views * charles babbage dorset street manchester square june  *footnote i am happy to avail myself of this occasion of expressing my obligations to the right hon manners sutton the speaker of the house of commons to whom i am indebted for copies of a considerable collection of those reports  preface to the second edition  in two months from the publication of the first edition of this volume three thousand copies were in the hands of the public very little was spent in advertisements; the booksellers instead of aiding impeded its sale; * it formed no part of any popular series and yet the public in a few weeks purchased the whole edition some small part of this success perhaps was due to the popular exposition of those curious processes which are carried on in our workshops and to the endeavour to take a short view of the general principles which direct the manufactories of the country but the chief reason was the commanding attraction of the subject and the increasing desire to become acquainted with the pursuits and interests of that portion of the people which has recently acquired so large an accession of political influence  *footnote i had good evidence of this fact from various quarters; and being desirous of verifying it i myself applied for a copy at the shop of a bookseller of respectability who is probably not aware that he refused to procure one even for its author  a greater degree of attention than i had expected has been excited by what i have stated in the first edition respecting the 'booktrade' until i had commenced the chapter 'on the separate cost of each process of a manufacture' i had no intention of alluding to that subject but the reader will perceive that i have throughout this volume wherever i could employed as illustrations objects of easy access to the reader; and in accordance with that principle i selected the volume itself when i arrived at the chapter 'on combinations of masters against the public' i was induced for the same reason to expose a combination connected with literature which in my opinion is both morally and politically wrong i entered upon this enquiry without the slightest feeling of hostility to that trade nor have i any wish unfavourable to it; but i think a complete reform in its system would add to its usefulness and respectability as the subject of that chapter has been much discussed i have thought it right to take a view of the various arguments which have been advanced and to offer my own opinion respecting their validityand there i should have left the subject content to allow my general character to plead for me against insinuations respecting my motivesbut as the remarks of some of my critics affect the character of another person i think it but just to state circumstances which will clearly disprove them mr fellowes of ludgate street who had previously been the publisher of some other volumes for me had undertaken the publication of the first edition of the present work a short time previous to its completion i thought it right to call his attention to the chapter in which the booktrade is discussed; with the view both of making him acquainted with what i had stated and also of availing myself of his knowledge in correcting any accidental error as to the facts mr fellowes 'differing from me entirely respecting the conclusions i had arrived at' then declined the publication of the volume if i had then chosen to apply to some of those other booksellers whose names appear in the committee of 'the trade' it is probable that they also would have declined the office of publishing for me; and had my object been to make a case against the trade such a course would have assisted me but i had no such feeling; and having procured a complete copy of the whole work i called with it on mr knight of pall mall east whom until that day i had never seen and with whom i had never previously had the slightest communication i left the book in mr knight's hands with a request that when he had read it i might be informed whether he would undertake the publication of it; and this he consented to do mr knight therefore is so far from being responsible for a single opinion in the present volume that he saw it only for a short time a few days previous to its publication it has been objected to me that i have exposed too freely the secrets of trade the only real secrets of trade are industry integrity and knowledge to the possessors of these no exposure can be injurious; and they never fail to produce respect and wealth the alterations in the present edition are so frequent that i found it impossible to comprise them in a supplement but the three new chapters 'on money as a medium of exchange'; 'on a new system of manufacturing'; and 'on the effect of machinery in reducing the demand for labour'; will shortly be printed separately for the use of the purchasers of the first edition i am inclined to attach some importance to the new system of manufacturing; and venture to throw it out with the hope of its receiving a full discussion among those who are most interested in the subject i believe that some such system of conducting manufactories would greatly increase the productive powers of any country adopting it; and that our own possesses much greater facilities for its application than other countries in the greater intelligence and superior education of the working classes the system would naturally commence in some large town by the union of some of the most prudent and active workmen; and their example if successful would be followed by others the small capitalist would next join them and such factories would go on increasing until competition compelled the large capitalist to adopt the same system; and ultimately the whole faculties of every man engaged in manufacture would be concentrated upon one objectthe art of producing a good article at the lowest possible costwhilst the moral effect on that class of the population would be useful in the highest degree since it would render character of far greater value to the workman than it is at present to one criticism which has been made this volume is perfectly open i have dismissed the important subject of the patentlaws in a few lines the subject presents in my opinion great difficulties and i have been unwilling to write upon it because i do not see my way i will only here advert to one difficulty what constitutes an invention? few simple mechanical contrivances are new; and most combinations may be viewed as species and classed under genera of more or less generality; and may in consequence be pronounced old or new according to the mechanical knowledge of the person who gives his opinion some of my critics have amused their readers with the wildness of the schemes i have occasionally thrown out; and i myself have sometimes smiled along with them perhaps it were wiser for present reputation to offer nothing but profoundly meditated plans but i do not think knowledge will be most advanced by that course; such sparks may kindle the energies of other minds more favourably circumstanced for pursuing the enquiries thus i have now ventured to give some speculations on the mode of blowing furnaces for smelting iron; and even supposing them to be visionary it is of some importance thus to call the attention of a large population engaged in one of our most extensive manufactures to the singular fact that fourfifths of the steam power used to blow their furnaces actually cools them i have collected with some pains the criticisms* on the first edition of this work and have availed myself of much information which has been communicated to me by my friends for the improvement of the present volume if i have succeeded in expressing what i had to explain with perspicuity i am aware that much of this clearness is due to my friend dr fitton to whom both the present and the former edition are indebted for such an examination and correction as an author himself has very rarely the power to bestow  *footnote several of these have probably escaped me and i shall feel indebted to any one who will inform my publisher of any future remarks  november section i introduction the object of the present volume is to point out the effects and the advantages which arise from the use of tools and machines;to endeavour to classify their modes of action;and to trace both the causes and the consequences of applying machinery to supersede the skill and power of the human arm a view of the mechanical part of the subject will in the first instance occupy our attention and to this the first section of the work will be devoted the first chapter of the section will contain some remarks on the general sources from whence the advantages of machinery are derived and the succeeding nine chapters will contain a detailed examination of principles of a less general character the eleventh chapter contains numerous subdivisions and is important from the extensive classification it affords of the arts in which copying is so largely employed the twelfth chapter which completes the first section contains a few suggestions for the assistance of those who propose visiting manufactories the second section after an introductory chapter on the difference between making and manufacturing will contain in the succeeding chapters a discussion of many of the questions which relate to the political economy of the subject it was found that the domestic arrangement or interior economy of factories was so interwoven with the more general questions that it was deemed unadvisable to separate the two subjects the concluding chapter of this section and of the work itself relates to the future prospects of manufactures as arising from the application of science  chapter  sources of the advantages arising from machinery and manufactures  there exists perhaps no single circumstance which distinguishes our country more remarkably from all others than the vast extent and perfection to which we have carried the contrivance of tools and machines for forming those conveniences of which so large a quantity is consumed by almost every class of the community the amount of patient thought of repeated experiment of happy exertion of genius by which our manufactures have been created and carried to their present excellence is scarcely to be imagined if we look around the rooms we inhabit or through those storehouses of every convenience of every luxury that man can desire which deck the crowded streets of our larger cities we shall find in the history of each article of every fabric a series of failures which have gradually led the way to excellence; and we shall notice in the art of making even the most insignificant of them processes calculated to excite our admiration by their simplicity or to rivet our attention by their unlookedfor results  the accumulation of skill and science which has been directed to diminish the difficulty of producing manufactured goods has not been beneficial to that country alone in which it is concentrated; distant kingdoms have participated in its advantages the luxurious natives of the east* and the ruder inhabitants of the african desert are alike indebted to our looms the produce of our factories has preceded even our most enterprising travellers* the cotton of india is conveyed by british ships round half our planet to be woven by british skill in the factories of lancashire it is again set in motion by british capital; and transported to the very plains whereon it grew is repurchased by the lords of the soil which gave it birth at a cheaper price than that at which their coarser machinery enables them to manufacture it themselves*  the large proportion of the population of this country who are engaged in manufactures appears from the following table deduced from a statement in an essay on the distribution of wealth by the rev r jones for every hundred persons employed in agriculture there are     agriculturists nonagriculturists  in bengal     in italy     in france     in england     the fact that the proportion of nonagricultural to agricultural persons is continually increasing appears both from the report of the committee of the house of commons upon manufacturers' employment july and from the still later evidence of the last census; from which document the annexed table of the increase of population in our great manufacturing towns has been deduced increase of population per cent names of places      total manchester      glasgow       liverpool*      nottingham      birmingham      great britain     thus in three periods of ten years during each of which the general population of the country has increased about per cent or about per cent upon the whole period of thirty years the population of these towns has on the average increased per cent after this statement there requires no further argument to demonstrate the vast importance to the wellbeing of this country of making the interests of its manufacturers well understood and attended to  the advantages which are derived from machinery and manufactures seem to arise principally from three sources the addition which they make to human power the economy they produce of human time the conversion of substances apparently common and worthless into valuable products  of additions to human power with respect to the first of these causes the forces derived from wind from water and from steam present themselves to the mind of every one; these are in fact additions to human power and will be considered in a future page there are however other sources of its increase by which the animal force of the individual is itself made to act with far greater than its unassisted power; and to these we shall at present confine our observations the construction of palaces of temples and of tombs seems to have occupied the earliest attention of nations just entering on the career of civilization; and the enormous blocks of stone moved from their native repositories to minister to the grandeur or piety of the builders have remained to excite the astonishment of their posterity long after the purposes of many of these records as well as the names of their founders have been forgotten the different degrees of force necessary to move these ponderous masses will have varied according to the mechanical knowledge of the people employed in their transport; and that the extent of power required for this purpose is widely different under different circumstances will appear from the following experiment which is related by m rondelet sur l'art de batir a block of squared stone was taken for the subject of experiment  weight of stone lbs  in order to drag this stone along the floor of the quarry roughly chiselled it required a force equal to lbs  the same stone dragged over a floor of planks required lbs  the same stone placed on a platform of wood and dragged over a floor of planks required lbs  after soaping the two surfaces of wood which slid over each other it required lbs  the same stone was now placed upon rollers of three inches diameter when it required to put it in motion along the floor of the quarry lbs  to drag it by these rollers over a wooden floor lbs  when the stone was mounted on a wooden platform and the same rollers placed between that and a plank floor it required lbs  from this experiment it results that the force necessary to move a stone along        part of its weight the roughly chiselled floor of its quarry is nearly along a wooden floor       by wood upon wood      if the wooden surfaces are soaped    with rollers on the floor of the quarry   on rollers on wood      on rollers between wood      at each increase of knowledge as well as on the contrivance of every new tool human labour becomes abridged the man who contrived rollers invented a tool by which his power was quintupled the workman who first suggested the employment of soap or grease was immediately enabled to move without exerting a greater effort more than three times the weight he could before*  the economy of human time is the next advantage of machinery in manufactures so extensive and important is this effect that we might if we were inclined to generalize embrace almost all the advantages under this single head but the elucidation of principles of less extent will contribute more readily to a knowledge of the subject; and as numerous examples will be presented to the reader in the ensuing pages we shall restrict our illustrations upon this point as an example of the economy of time the use of gunpowder in blasting rocks may be noticed several pounds of powder may be purchased for a sum acquired by a few days' labour yet when this is employed for the purpose alluded to effects are frequently produced which could not even with the best tools be accomplished by other means in less than many months the dimensions of one of the blocks of limestone extracted from the quarries worked for the formation of the breakwater at plymouth were  ft long ft wide and ft deep this mass containing above cubic feet and weighing about tons was blasted three times two charges of lbs each were successively exploded in a hole feet deep the bore being inches at top and  inches at bottom lbs of powder were afterwards exploded in the rent formed by those operations each pound of gunpowder separated from the rock two tons of matter or nearly times its own weight the expense of the powder was l or nearly d per lb the boring occupied two men during a day and a half and cost about s; and the value of the produce was at that time about l  the simple contrivance of tin tubes for speaking through communicating between different apartments by which the directions of the superintendent are instantly conveyed to the remotest parts of an establishment produces a considerable economy of time it is employed in the shops and manufactories in london and might with advantage be used in domestic establishments particularly in large houses in conveying orders from the nursery to the kitchen or from the house to the stable its convenience arises not merely from saving the servant or workman useless journeys to receive directions but from relieving the master himself from that indisposition to give trouble which frequently induces him to forego a trifling want when he knows that his attendant must mount several flights of stairs to ascertain his wishes and after descending must mount again to supply them the distance to which such a mode of communication can be extended does not appear to have been ascertained and would be an interesting subject for enquiry admitting it to be possible between london and liverpool about seventeen minutes would elapse before the words spoken at one end would reach the other extremity of the pipe  the art of using the diamond for cutting glass has undergone within a few years a very important improvement a glazier's apprentice when using a diamond set in a conical ferrule as was always the practice about twenty years since found great difficulty in acquiring the art of using it with certainty; and at the end of a seven years' apprenticeship many were found but indifferently skilled in its employment this arose from the difficulty of finding the precise angle at which the diamond cuts and of guiding it along the glass at the proper inclination when that angle is found almost the whole of the time consumed and of the glass destroyed in acquiring the art of cutting glass may now be saved by the use of an improved tool the gem is set in a small piece of squared brass with its edges nearly parallel to one side of the square a person skilled in its use now files away the brass on one side until by trial he finds that the diamond will make a clean cut when guided by keeping this edge pressed against a ruler the diamond and its mounting are now attached to a stick like a pencil by means of a swivel allowing a small angular motion thus even the beginner at once applies the cutting edge at the proper angle by pressing the side of the brass against a ruler; and even though the part he holds in his hand should deviate a little from the required angle it communicates no irregularity to the position of the diamond which rarely fails to do its office when thus employed the relative hardness of the diamond in different directions is a singular fact an experienced workman on whose judgement i can rely informed me that he has seen a diamond ground with diamond powder on a castiron mill for three hours without its being at all worn but that on changing its direction with respect to the grinding surface the same edge was ground away  employment of materials of little value the skins used by the goldbeater are produced from the offal of animals the hoofs of horses and cattle and other horny refuse are employed in the production of the prussiate of potash that beautiful yellow crystallized salt which is exhibited in the shops of some of our chemists the wornout saucepans and tinware of our kitchens when beyond the reach of the tinker's art are not utterly worthless we sometimes meet carts loaded with old tin kettles and wornout iron coalskuttles traversing our streets these have not yet completed their useful course; the less corroded parts are cut into strips punched with small holes and varnished with a coarse black varnish for the use of the trunkmaker who protects the edges and angles of his boxes with them; the remainder are conveyed to the manufacturing chemists in the outskirts of the town who employ them in combination with pyroligneous acid in making a black die for the use of calico printers  of tools the difference between a tool and a machine is not capable of very precise distinction; nor is it necessary in a popular explanation of those terms to limit very strictly their acceptation a tool is usually more simple than a machine; it is generally used with the hand whilst a machine is frequently moved by animal or steam power the simpler machines are often merely one or more tools placed in a frame and acted on by a moving power in pointing out the advantages of tools we shall commence with some of the simplest  to arrange twenty thousand needles thrown promiscuously into a box mixed and entangled in every possible direction in such a form that they shall be all parallel to each other would at first sight appear a most tedious occupation; in fact if each needle were to be separated individually many hours must be consumed in the process yet this is an operation which must be performed many times in the manufacture of needles; and it is accomplished in a few minutes by a very simple tool; nothing more being requisite than a small flat tray of sheet iron slightly concave at the bottom in this the needles are placed and shaken in a peculiar manner by throwing them up a very little and giving at the same time a slight longitudinal motion to the tray the shape of the needles assists their arrangement; for if two needles cross each other unless which is exceedingly improbable they happen to be precisely balanced they will when they fall on the bottom of the tray tend to place themselves side by side and the hollow form of the tray assists this disposition as they have no projection in any part to impede this tendency or to entangle each other they are by continually shaking arranged lengthwise in three or four minutes the direction of the shake is now changed the needles are but little thrown up but the tray is shaken endways; the result of which is that in a minute or two the needles which were previously arranged endways become heaped up in a wall with their ends against the extremity of the tray they are then removed by hundreds at a time with a broad iron spatula on which they are retained by the forefinger of the left hand as this parallel arrangement of the needles must be repeated many times if a cheap and expeditious method had not been devised the expense of the manufacture would have been considerably enhanced  another process in the art of making needles furnishes an example of one of the simplest contrivances which can come under the denomination of a tool after the needles have been arranged in the manner just described it is necessary to separate them into two parcels in order that their points may be all in one direction this is usually done by women and children the needles are placed sideways in a heap on a table in front of each operator just as they are arranged by the process above described from five to ten are rolled towards this person with the forefinger of the left hand; this separates them a very small space from each other and each in its turn is pushed lengthwise to the right or to the left according to the direction of the point this is the usual process and in it every needle passes individually under the finger of the operator a small alteration expedites the process considerably the child puts on the forefinger of its right hand a small cloth cap or fingerstall and rolling out of the heap from six to twelve needles he keeps them down by the forefinger of the left hand whilst he presses the forefinger of the right hand gently against their ends those which have the points towards the right hand stick into the fingerstall; and the child removing the finger of the left hand slightly raises the needles sticking into the cloth and then pushes them towards the left side those needles which had their eyes on the right hand do not stick into the finger cover and are pushed to the heap on the right side before the repetition of this process by means of this simple contrivance each movement of the finger from one side to the other carries five or six needles to their proper heap; whereas in the former method frequently only one was moved and rarely more than two or three were transported at one movement to their place  various operations occur in the arts in which the assistance of an additional hand would be a great convenience to the workman and in these cases tools or machines of the simplest structure come to our aid vices of different forms in which the material to be wrought is firmly grasped by screws are of this kind and are used in almost every workshop; but a more striking example may be found in the trade of the nailmaker some kinds of nails such as those used for defending the soles of coarse shoes called hobnails require a particular form of the head which is made by the stroke of a die the workman holds one end of the rod of iron out of which he forms the nails in his left hand; with his right hand he hammers the redhot end of it into a point and cutting the proper length almost off bends it nearly at a right angle he puts this into a hole in a small stakeiron immediately under a hammer which is connected with a treadle and has a die sunk in its surface corresponding to the intended form of the head; and having given one part of the form to the head with the small hammer in his hand he moves the treadle with his foot disengages the other hammer and completes the figure of the head; the returning stroke produced by the movement of the treadle striking the finished nail out of the hole in which it was retained without this substitution of his foot for another hand the workman would probably be obliged to heat the nails twice over  another though fortunately a less general substitution of tools for human hands is used to assist the labour of those who are deprived by nature or by accident of some of their limbs those who have had an opportunity of examining the beautiful contrivances for the manufacture of shoes by machinery which we owe to the fertile invention of mr brunel must have noticed many instances in which the workmen were enabled to execute their task with precision although labouring under the disadvantages of the loss of an arm or leg a similar instance occurs at liverpool in the institution for the blind where a machine is used by those afflicted with blindness for weaving sashlines; it is said to have been the invention of a person suffering under that calamity other examples might be mentioned of contrivances for the use the amusement or the instruction of the wealthier classes who labour under the same natural disadvantages these triumphs of skill and ingenuity deserve a double portion of our admiration when applied to mitigate the severity of natural or accidental misfortune; when they supply the rich with occupation and knowledge; when they relieve the poor from the additional evils of poverty and want  division of the objects of machinery there exists a natural although in point of number a very unequal division amongst machines they may be classed as; first those which are employed to produce power and as secondly those which are intended merely to transmit force and execute work the first of these divisions is of great importance and is very limited in the variety of its species although some of those species consist of numerous individuals of that class of mechanical agents by which motion is transmittedthe lever the pulley the wedge and many others it has been demonstrated that no power is gained by their use however combined whatever force is applied at one point can only be exerted at some other diminished by friction and other incidental causes; and it has been further proved that whatever is gained in the rapidity of execution is compensated by the necessity of exerting additional force these two principles long since placed beyond the reach of doubt cannot be too constantly borne in mind but in limiting our attempts to things which are possible we are still as we hope to shew possessed of a field of inexhaustible research and of advantages derived from mechanical skill which have but just begun to exercise their influence on our arts and may be pursued without limit contributing to the improvement the wealth and the happiness of our race  of those machines by which we produce power it may be observed that although they are to us immense acquisitions yet in regard to two of the sources of this powerthe force of wind and of waterwe merely make use of bodies in a state of motion by nature; we change the directions of their movement in order to render them subservient to our purposes but we neither add to nor diminish the quantity of motion in existence when we expose the sails of a windmill obliquely to the gale we check the velocity of a small portion of the atmosphere and convert its own rectilinear motion into one of rotation in the sails; we thus change the direction of force but we create no power the same may be observed with regard to the sails of a vessel; the quantity of motion given by them is precisely the same as that which is destroyed in the atmosphere if we avail ourselves of a descending stream to turn a waterwheel we are appropriating a power which nature may appear at first sight to be uselessly and irrecoverably wasting but which upon due examination we shall find she is ever regaining by other processes the fluid which is falling from a higher to a lower level carries with it the velocity due to its revolution with the earth at a greater distance from its centre it will therefore accelerate although to an almost infinitesimal extent the earth's daily rotation the sum of all these increments of velocity arising from the descent of all the falling waters on the earth's surface would in time become perceptible did not nature by the process of evaporation convey the waters back to their sources; and thus again by removing matter to a greater distance from the centre destroy the velocity generated by its previous approach  the force of vapour is another fertile source of moving power; but even in this case it cannot be maintained that power is created water is converted into elastic vapour by the combustion of fuel the chemical changes which thus take place are constantly increasing the atmosphere by large quantities of carbonic acid and other gases noxious to animal life the means by which nature decomposes these elements or reconverts them into a solid form are not sufficiently known but if the end could be accomplished by mechanical force it is almost certain that the power necessary to produce it would at least equal that which was generated by the original combustion man therefore does not create power; but availing himself of his knowledge of nature's mysteries he applies his talents to diverting a small and limited portion of her energies to his own wants and whether he employs the regulated action of steam or the more rapid and tremendous effects of gunpowder he is only producing on a small scale compositions and decompositions which nature is incessantly at work in reversing for the restoration of that equilibrium which we cannot doubt is constantly maintained throughout even the remotest limits of our system the operations of man participate in the character of their author; they are diminutive but energetic during the short period of their existence whilst those of nature acting over vast spaces and unlimited by time are ever pursuing their silent and resistless career  in stating the broad principle that all combinations of mechanical art can only augment the force communicated to the machine at the expense of the time employed in producing the effect it might perhaps be imagined that the assistance derived from such contrivances is small this is however by no means the case since the almost unlimited variety they afford enables us to exert to the greatest advantage whatever force we employ there is it is true a limit beyond which it is impossible to reduce the power necessary to produce any given effect but it very seldom happens that the methods first employed at all approach that limit in dividing the knotted root of a tree for fuel how very different will be the time consumed according to the nature of the tool made use of! the hatchet or the adze will divide it into small parts but will consume a large portion of the workman's time the saw will answer the same purpose more quickly and more effectually this in its turn is superseded by the wedge which rends it in a still shorter time if the circumstances are favourable and the workman skilful the time and expense may be still further reduced by the use of a small quantity of gunpowder exploded in holes judiciously placed in the block  when a mass of matter is to be removed a certain force must be expended; and upon the proper economy of this force the price of transport will depend a country must however have reached a high degree of civilization before it will have approached the limit of this economy the cotton of java is conveyed in junks to the coast of china; but from the seed not being previously separated threequarters of the weight thus carried is not cotton this might perhaps be justified in java by the want of machinery to separate the seed or by the relative cost of the operation in the two countries but the cotton itself as packed by the chinese occupies three times the bulk of an equal quantity shipped by europeans for their own markets thus the freight of a given quantity of cotton costs the chinese nearly twelve times the price to which by a proper attention to mechanical methods it might be reduced * notes  'the bandana handkerchiefs manufactured at glasgow have long superseded the genuine ones

diminishing friction that the drivers of sledges in amsterdam on which heavy goods are transported carry in their hand a rope soaked in tallow which they throw down from time to time before the sledge in order that by passing over the rope it may become greased  chapter  accumulating power  whenever the work to be done requires more force for its execution than can be generated in the time necessary for its completion recourse must be had to some mechanical method of preserving and condensing a part of the power exerted previously to the commencement of the process this is most frequently accomplished by a flywheel which is in fact nothing more than a wheel having a very heavy rim so that the greater part of its weight is near the circumference it requires great power applied for some time to put this into rapid motion; but when moving with considerable velocity the effects are exceedingly powerful if its force be concentrated upon a small object in some of the iron works where the power of the steamengine is a little too small for the rollers which it drives it is usual to set the engine at work a short time before the redhot iron is ready to be removed from the furnace to the rollers and to allow it to work with great rapidity until the fly has acquired a velocity rather alarming to those unused to such establishments on passing the softened mass of iron through the first groove the engine receives a great and very perceptible check; and its speed is diminished at the next and at each succeeding passage until the iron bar is reduced to such a size that the ordinary power of the engine is sufficient to roll it  the powerful effect of a large flywheel when its force can be concentrated on a point was curiously illustrated at one of the largest of our manufactories the proprietor was shewing to a friend the method of punching holes in iron plates for the boilers of steamengines he held in his hand a piece of sheetiron threeeighths of an inch thick which he placed under the punch observing after several holes had been made that the punch made its perforations more and more slowly he called to the engineman to know what made the engine work so sluggishly when it was found that the flywheel and punching apparatus had been detached from the steamengine just at the commencement of his experiment  another mode of accumulating power arises from lifting a weight and then allowing it to fall a man even with a heavy hammer might strike repeated blows upon the head of a pile without producing any effect but if he raises a much heavier hammer to a much greater height its fall though far less frequently repeated will produce the desired effect when a small blow is given to a large mass of matter as to a pile the imperfect elasticity of the material causes a small loss of momentum in the transmission of the motion from each particle to the succeeding one; and therefore it may happen that the whole force communicated shall be destroyed before it reaches the opposite extremity  the power accumulated within a small space by gunpowder is well known; and though not strictly an illustration of the subject discussed in this chapter some of its effects under peculiar circumstances are so singular that an attempt to explain them may perhaps be excused if a gun is loaded with ball it will not kick so much as when loaded with small shot; and amongst different kinds of shot that which is the smallest causes the greatest recoil against the shoulder a gun loaded with a quantity of sand equal in weight to a charge of snipeshot kicks still more if in loading a space is left between the wadding and the charge the gun either recoils violently or bursts if the muzzle of a gun has accidentally been stuck into the ground so as to be stopped up with clay or even with snow or if it be fired with its muzzle plunged into water the almost certain result is that it bursts the ultimate cause of these apparently inconsistent effects is that every force requires time to produce its effect; and if the time requisite for the elastic vapour within to force out the sides of the barrel is less than that in which the condensation of the air near the wadding is conveyed in sufficient force to drive the impediment from the muzzle then the barrel must burst if sometimes happens that these two forces are so nearly balanced that the barrel only swells; the obstacle giving way before the gun is actually burst the correctness of this explanation will appear by tracing step by step the circumstances which arise on discharging a gun loaded with powder confined by a cylindrical piece of wadding and having its muzzle filled with clay or some other substance having a moderate degree of resistance in this case the first effect of the explosion is to produce an enormous pressure on everything confining it and to advance the wadding through a very small space here let us consider it as at rest for a moment and examine its condition the portion of air in immediate contact with the wadding is condensed; and if the wadding were to remain at rest the air throughout the tube would soon acquire a uniform density but this would require a small interval of time; for the condensation next the wadding would travel with the velocity of sound to the other end from whence being reflected back a series of waves would be generated which aided by the friction of the tube would ultimately destroy the motion but until the first wave reaches the impediment at the muzzle the air can exert no pressure against it now if the velocity communicated to the wadding is very much greater than that of sound the condensation of the air immediately in advance of it may be very great before the resistance transmitted to the muzzle is at all considerable; in which case the mutual repulsion of the particles of air so compressed will offer an absolute barrier to the advance of the wadding* if this explanation be correct the additional recoil when a gun is loaded with small shot or sand may arise in some measure from the condensation of the air contained between their particles; but chiefly from the velocity communicated by the explosion to those particles of the substances in immediate contact with the powder being greater than that with which a wave can be transmitted through them it also affords a reason for the success of a method of blasting rocks by filling the upper part of the hole above the powder with sand instead of clay rammed hard that the destruction of the gun barrel does not arise from the property possessed by fluids and in some measure also by sand and small shot of pressing equally in all directions and thus exerting a force against a large portion of the interior surface seems to be proved by a circumstance mentioned by le vaillant and other travellers that for the purpose of taking birds without injuring their plumage they filled the barrel of their fowling pieces with water instead of loading them with a charge of shot  the same reasoning explains a curious phenomenon which occurs in firing a still more powerfully explosive substance if we put a small quantity of fulminating silver upon the face of an anvil and strike it slightly with a hammer it explodes; but instead of breaking either the hammer or the anvil it is found that that part of the face of each in contact with the fulminating silver is damaged in this case the velocity communicated by the elastic matter disengaged may be greater than the velocity of a wave traversing steel; so that the particles at the surface are driven by the explosion so near to those next adjacent that when the compelling force is removed the repulsion of the particles within the mass drives back those nearer to the surface with such force that they pass beyond the limits of attraction and are separated in the shape of powder  i the success of the experiment of firing a tallow candle through a deal board would be explained in the same manner by supposing the velocity of a wave propagated through deal to be greater than that of a wave passing through tallow  ii the boiler of a steamengine sometimes bursts even during the escape of steam through the safetyvalve if the water in the boiler is thrown upon any part which happens to be red hot the steam formed in the immediate neighbourhood of that part expands with greater velocity than that with which a wave can be transmitted through the less heated steam; consequently one particle is urged against the next and an almost invincible obstacle is formed in the same manner as described in the case of the discharge of a gun if the safetyvalve is closed it may retain the pressure thus created for a short time and even when it is open the escape may not be sufficiently rapid to remove all impediment; there may therefore exist momentarily within the boiler pressures of various force varying from that which can just lift the safetyvalve up to that which is sufficient if exerted during an extremely small space of time to tear open the boiler itself  this reasoning ought however to be admitted with caution; and perhaps some inducement to examine it carefully may be presented by tracing it to extreme cases it would seem but this is not a necessary consequence that a gun might be made so long that it would burst although no obstacle filled up its muzzle it should also follow that if after the gun is charged the air were extracted from the barrel though the muzzle be then left closed the gun ought not to burst it would also seem to follow from the principle of the explanation that a body might be projected in air or other elastic resisting medium with such force that after advancing a very short space it should return in the same direction in which it was projected notes  see poisson's remarks ecole polytec cahier xxi p chapter  regulating power  uniformity and steadiness in the rate at which machinery works are essential both for its effect and its duration the first illustration which presents itself is that beautiful contrivance the governor of the steamengine which must immediately occur to all who are familiar with that admirable engine wherever the increased speed of the engine would lead to injurious or dangerous consequences this is applied; and it is equally the regulator of the waterwheel which drives a spinningjenny or of the windmills which drain our fens in the dockyard at chatham the descending motion of a large platform on which timber is raised is regulated by a governor; but as the weight is very considerable the velocity of this governor is still further checked by causing its motion to take place in water  another very beautiful contrivance for regulating the number of strokes made by a steamengine is used in cornwall it is called the cataract and depends on the time required to fill a vessel plunged in water the opening of the valve through which the fluid is admitted being adjustable at the will of the engineman  the regularity of the supply of fuel to the fire under the boilers of steamengines is another mode of contributing to the uniformity of their rate and also economizes the consumption of coal several patents have been taken out for methods of regulating this supply the general principle being to make the engine supply the fire with small quantities of fuel at regular intervals by means of a hopper and to make it diminish this supply when the engine works too quickly one of the incidental advantages of this plan is that by throwing on a very small quantity of coal at a time the smoke is almost entirely consumed the dampers of ashpits and chimneys are also in some cases connected with machines in order to regulate their speed  another contrivance for regulating the effect of machinery consists in a vane or fly of little weight but presenting a large surface this revolves rapidly and soon acquires a uniform rate which it cannot greatly exceed because any addition to its velocity produces a much greater addition to the resistance it meets with from the air the interval between the strokes on the bell of a clock is regulated in this way and the fly is so contrived that the interval may be altered by presenting the arms of it more or less obliquely to the direction in which they move this kind of fly or vane is generally used in the smaller kinds of mechanism and unlike the heavy fly it is a destroyer instead of a preserver of force it is the regulator used in musical boxes and in almost all mechanical toys  the action of a fly or vane suggests the principle of an instrument for measuring the altitude of mountains which perhaps deserves a trial since if it succeed only tolerably it will form a much more portable instrument than the barometer it is well known that the barometer indicates the weight of a column of the atmosphere above it whose base is equal to the bore of the tube it is also known that the density of the air adjacent to the instrument will depend both on the weight of air above it and on the heat of the air at that place if therefore we can measure the density of the air and its temperature the height of a column of mercury which it would support in the barometer can be found by calculation now the thermometer gives information respecting the temperature of the air immediately; and its density might be ascertained by means of a watch and a small instrument in which the number of turns made by a vane moved by a constant force should be registered the less dense the air in which the vane revolves the greater will be the number of its revolutions in a given time and tables could be formed from experiments in partially exhausted vessels aided by calculation from which if the temperature of the air and the number of revolutions of the vane are given the corresponding height of the barometer might be found* notes  to persons who may be inclined to experiment upon this or any other instrument i would beg to suggest the perusal of the section 'on the art of observing' observations on the decline of science in england p fellowes chapter  increase and diminution of velocity  the fatigue produced on the muscles of the human frame does not altogether depend on the actual force employed in each effort but partly on the frequency with which it is exerted the exertion necessary to accomplish every operation consists of two parts one of these is the expenditure of force which is necessary to drive the tool or instrument; and the other is the effort required for the motion of some limb of the animal producing the action in driving a nail into a piece of wood one of these is lifting the hammer and propelling its head against the nail; the other is raising the arm itself and moving it in order to use the hammer if the weight of the hammer is considerable the former part will cause the greatest portion of the exertion if the hammer is light the exertion of raising the arm will produce the greatest part of the fatigue it does therefore happen that operations requiring very trifling force if frequently repeated will tire more effectually than more laborious work there is also a degree of rapidity beyond which the action of the muscles cannot be pressed  the most advantageous load for a porter who carries wood up stairs on his shoulders has been investigated by m coulomb; but he found from experiment that a man walking up stairs without any load and raising his burden by means of his own weight in descending could do as much work in one day as four men employed in the ordinary way with the most favourable load  the proportion between the velocity with which men or animals move and the weights they carry is a matter of considerable importance particularly in military affairs it is also of great importance for the economy of labour to adjust the weight of that part of the animal's body which is moved the weight of the tool it urges and the frequency of repetition of these efforts so as to produce the greatest effect an instance of the saving of time by making the same motion of the arm execute two operations instead of one occurs in the simple art of making the tags of bootlaces these tags are formed out of very thin tinned sheetiron and were formerly cut out of long strips of that material into pieces of such a breadth that when bent round they just enclosed the lace two pieces of steel have recently been fixed to the side of the shears by which each piece of tinnediron as soon as it is cut is bent into a semicylindrical form the additional power required for this operation is almost imperceptible and it is executed by the same motion of the arm which produces the cut the work is usually performed by women and children; and with the improved tool more than three times the quantity of tags is produced in a given time*  whenever the work is itself light it becomes necessary in order to economize time to increase the velocity twisting the fibres of wool by the fingers would be a most tedious operation in the common spinningwheel the velocity of the foot is moderate but by a very simple contrivance that of the thread is most rapid a piece of catgut passing round a large wheel and then round a small spindle effects this change this contrivance is common to a multitude of machines some of them very simple in large shops for the retail of ribands it is necessary at short intervals to 'take stock' that is to measure and rewind every piece of riband an operation which even with this mode of shortening it is sufficiently tiresome but without it would be almost impossible from its expense the small balls of sewing cotton so cheap and so beautifully wound are formed by a machine on the same principle and but a few steps more complicated  in turning from the smaller instruments in frequent use to the larger and more important machines the economy arising from the increase of velocity becomes more striking in converting cast into wroughtiron a mass of metal of about a hundredweight is heated almost to white heat and placed under a heavy hammer moved by water or steam power this is raised by a projection on a revolving axis; and if the hammer derived its momentum only from the space through which it fell it would require a considerably greater time to give a blow but as it is important that the softened mass of redhot iron should receive as many blows as possible before it cools the form of the cam or projection on the axis is such that the hammer instead of being lifted to a small height is thrown up with a jerk and almost the instant after it strikes against a large beam which acts as a powerful spring and drives it down on the iron with such velocity that by these means about double the number of strokes can be made in a given time in the smaller tilthammers this is carried still further by striking the tail of the tilthammer forcibly against a small steel anvil it rebounds with such velocity that from three to five hundred strokes are made in a minute in the manufacture of anchors an art in which a similar contrivance is of still greater importance it has only been recently applied  in the manufacture of scythes the length of the blade renders it necessary that the workman should move readily so as to bring every part of it on the anvil in quick succession this is effected by placing him in a seat suspended by ropes from the ceiling so that he is enabled with little bodily exertion to vary his distance by pressing his feet against the block which supports the anvil or against the floor  an increase of velocity is sometimes necessary to render operations possible thus a person may skate with great rapidity over ice which would not support his weight if he moved over it more slowly this arises from the fact that time is requisite for producing the fracture of the ice as soon as the weight of the skater begins to act on any point the ice supported by the water bends slowly under him; but if the skater's velocity is considerable he has passed off from the spot which was loaded before the bending has reached the point which would cause the ice to break  an effect not very different from this might take place if very great velocity were communicated to boats let us suppose a flatbottomed boat whose bow forms an inclined plane with the bottom at rest in still water if we imagine some very great force suddenly to propel this boat the inclination of the plane at the forepart would cause it to rise in the water; and if the force were excessive it might even rise out of the water and advance by a series of leaps like a piece of slate or an oyster shell thrown as a 'duck and drake' if the force were not sufficient to pull the boat out of the water but were just enough to bring its bottom to the surface it would be carried along with a kind of gliding motion with great rapidity; for at every point of its course it would require a certain time before it could sink to its usual draft of water; but before that time had elapsed it would have advanced to another point and consequently have been raised by the reaction of the water on the inclined plane at its forepart  the same fact that bodies moving with great velocity have not time to exert the full effect of their weight seems to explain a circumstance which appears to be very unaccountable it sometimes happens that when footpassengers are knocked down by carriages the wheels pass over them with scarcely any injury though if the weight of the carriage had rested on their body even for a few seconds it would have crushed them to death if the view above taken is correct the injury in such circumstances will chiefly happen to that part of the body which is struck by the advancing wheel  an operation in which rapidity is of essential importance is in bringing the produce of mines up to the surface the shafts through which the produce is raised are sunk at a very great expense and it is of course desirable to sink as few of them as possible the matter to be extracted is therefore raised by steamengines with considerable velocity and without this many of our mines could not be worked with profit  the effect of great velocity in modifying the form of a cohesive substance is beautifully shown in the process for making window glass termed flashing which is one of the most striking operations in our domestic arts a workman having dipped his iron tube into the glass pot and loaded it with several pounds of the melted metal blows out a large globe which is connected with his rod by a short thick hollow neck another workman now fixes to the globe immediately opposite to its neck an iron rod the extremity of which has been dipped in the melted glass; and when this is firmly attached a few drops of water separate the neck of the globe from the iron tube the rod with the globe attached to it is now held at the mouth of a glowing furnace and by turning the rod the globe is made to revolve slowly so as to be uniformly exposed to the heat the first effect of this softening is to make the glass contract upon itself and to enlarge the opening of the neck as the softening proceeds the globe is turned more quickly on its axis and when very soft and almost incandescent it is removed from the fire and the velocity of rotation being still continually increased the opening enlarges from the effect of the centrifugal force at first gradually until at last the mouth suddenly expands or flashes out into one large circular sheet of red hot glass the neck of the original globe which is to become the outer part of the sheet is left thick to admit of this expansion and forms the edge of the circular plate of glass which is called a table the centre presents the appearance of a thick boss or prominence called the bull'seye at the part by which it was attached to the iron rod  the most frequent reason for employing contrivances for diminishing velocity arises from the necessity of overcoming great resistances with small power systems of pulleys the crane and many other illustrations might also be adduced here as examples; but they belong more appropriately to some of the other causes which we have assigned for the advantages of machinery the common smokejack is an instrument in which the velocity communicated is too great for the purpose required and it is transmitted through wheels which reduce it to a more moderate rate  telegraphs are machines for conveying information over extensive lines with great rapidity they have generally been established for the purposes of transmitting information during war but the increasing wants of man will probably soon render them subservient to more peaceful objects a few years since the telegraph conveyed to paris information of the discovery of a comet by m gambart at marseilles the message arrived during a sitting of the french board of longitude and was sent in a note from the minister of the interior to laplace the president who received it whilst the writer of these lines was sitting by his side the object in this instance was to give the earliest publicity to the fact and to assure to m gambart the title of its first discoverer at liverpool a system of signals is established for the purposes of commerce so that each merchant can communicate with his own vessel long before she arrives in the port notes  see transactions of the society of arts chapter  extending the time of action of forces  this is one of the most common and most useful of the employments of machinery the half minute which we daily devote to the windingup of our watches is an exertion of labour almost insensible; yet by the aid of a few wheels its effect is spread over the whole twentyfour hours in our clocks this extension of the time of action of the original force impressed is carried still further; the better kind usually require winding up once in eight days and some are occasionally made to continue in action during a month or even a year another familiar illustration may be noticed in our domestic furniture the common jack by which our meat is roasted is a contrivance to enable the cook in a few minutes to exert a force which the machine retails out during the succeeding hour in turning the loaded spit; thus enabling her to bestow her undivided attention on the other important duties of her vocation a great number of automatons and mechanical toys moved by springs may be classed under this division  a small moving power in the shape of a jack or a spring with a train of wheels is often of great convenience to the experimental philosopher and has been used with advantage in magnetic and electric experiments where the rotation of a disk of metal or other body is necessary thus allowing to the enquirer the unimpeded use of both his hands a vane connected by a train of wheels and set in motion by a heavy weight has also on some occasions been employed in chemical processes to keep a solution in a state of agitation another object to which a similar apparatus may be applied is the polishing of small specimens of minerals for optical experiments  chapter  saving time in natural operations  the process of tanning will furnish us with a striking illustration of the power of machinery in accelerating certain processes in which natural operations have a principal effect the object of this art is to combine a certain principle called tanning with every particle of the skin to be tanned this in the ordinary process is accomplished by allowing the skins to soak in pits containing a solution of tanning matter they remain in the pits six twelve or eighteen months; and in some instances if the hides are very thick they are exposed to the operation for two years or even during a longer period this length of time is apparently required in order to allow the tanning matter to penetrate into the interior of a thick hide the improved process consists in placing the hides with the solution of tan in close vessels and then exhausting the air the effect is to withdraw any air which may be contained in the pores of the hides and to aid capillary attraction by the pressure of the atmosphere in forcing the tan into the interior of the skins the effect of the additional force thus brought into action can be equal only to one atmosphere but a further improvement has been made the vessel containing the hides is after exhaustion filled up with a solution of tan; a small additional quantity is then injected with a forcingpump by these means any degree of pressure may be given which the containing vessel is capable of supporting; and it has been found that by employing such a method the thickest hides may be tanned in six weeks or two months  the same process of injection might be applied to impregnate timber with tar or any other substance capable of preserving it from decay and if it were not too expensive the deal floors of houses might thus be impregnated with alumine or other substances which would render them much less liable to be accidentally set on fire in some cases it might be useful to impregnate woods with resins varnish or oil; and wood saturated with oil might in some instances be usefully employed in machinery for giving a constant but very minute supply of that fluid to iron or steel against which it is worked some idea of the quantity of matter which can be injected into wood by great pressure may be formed from considering the fact stated by mr scoresby respecting an accident which occurred to a boat of one of our whalingships the harpoon having been struck into the fish the whale in this instance dived directly down and carried the boat along with him on returning to the surface the animal was killed but the boat instead of rising was found suspended beneath the whale by the rope of the harpoon; and on drawing it up every part of the wood was found to be so completely saturated with water as to sink immediately to the bottom  the operation of bleaching linen in the open air is one for which considerable time is necessary; and although it does not require much labour yet from the risk of damage and of robbery from long exposure a mode of shortening the process was highly desirable the method now practised although not mechanical is such a remarkable instance of the application of science to the practical purposes of manufactures that in mentioning the advantages derived from shortening natural operations it would have been scarcely pardonable to have omitted all allusion to the beautiful application of chlorine in combination with lime to the art of bleaching  another instance more strictly mechanical occurs in some countries where fuel is expensive and the heat of the sun is not sufficient to evaporate the water from brine springs the water is first pumped up to a reservoir and then allowed to fall in small streams through faggots thus it becomes divided; and presenting a large surface evaporation is facilitated and the brine which is collected in the vessels below the faggots is stronger than that which was pumped up after thus getting rid of a large part of the water the remaining portion is driven off by boiling the success of this process depends on the condition of the atmosphere with respect to moisture if the air at the time the brine falls through the faggots holds in solution as much moisture as it can contain in an invisible state no more can be absorbed from the salt water and the labour expended in pumping is entirely wasted the state of the air as to dryness is therefore an important consideration in fixing the time when this operation is to be performed; and an attentive examination of its state by means of the hygrometer might be productive of some economy of labour  in some countries where wood is scarce the evaporation of salt water is carried on by a large collection of ropes which are stretched perpendicularly in passing down the ropes the water deposits the sulphate of lime which it held in solution and gradually incrusts them so that in the course of twenty years when they are nearly rotten they are still sustained by the surrounding incrustation thus presenting the appearance of a vast collection of small columns  amongst natural operations perpetually altering the surface of our globe there are some which it would be advantageous to accelerate the wearing down of the rocks which impede the rapids of navigable rivers is one of this class a very beautiful process for accomplishing this object has been employed in america a boat is placed at the bottom of the rapid and kept in its position by a long rope which is firmly fixed on the bank of the river near the top an axis having a wheel similar to the paddlewheel of a steamboat fixed at each end of it is placed across the boat; so that the two wheels and their connecting axis shall revolve rapidly being driven by the force of the passing current let us now imagine several beams of wood shod with pointed iron fixed at the ends of strong levers projecting beyond the bow of the boat as in the annexed representation if these levers are at liberty to move up and down and if one or more projecting pieces called cams are fixed on the axis opposite to the end of each lever the action of the stream upon the wheels will keep up a perpetual succession of blows the sharppointed shoe striking upon the rock at the bottom will continually detach small pieces which the stream will immediately carry off thus by the mere action of the river itself a constant and most effectual system of pounding the rock at its bottom is established a single workman may by the aid of a rudder direct the boat to any required part of the stream; and when it is necessary to move up the rapid as the channel is cut he can easily cause the boat to advance by means of a capstan  when the object of the machinery just described has been accomplished and the channel is sufficiently deep a slight alteration converts the apparatus to another purpose almost equally advantageous the stampers and the projecting pieces on the axis are removed and a barrel of wood or metal surrounding part of the axis and capable at pleasure of being connected with or disconnected from the axis itself is substituted the rope which hitherto fastened the boat is now fixed to this barrel; and if the barrel is loose upon the axis the paddlewheel makes the axis only revolve and the boat remains in its place but the moment the axis is attached to its surrounding barrel this begins to turn and winding up the rope the boat is gradually drawn up against the stream; and may be employed as a kind of tugboat for vessels which have occasion to ascend the rapid when the tugboat reaches the summit the barrel is released from the axis and friction being applied to moderate its velocity the boat is allowed to descend  clocks occupy a very high place amongst instruments by means of which human time is economized and their multiplication in conspicuous places in large towns is attended with many advantages their position nevertheless in london is often very ill chosen; and the usual place halfway up on a high steeple in the midst of narrow streets in a crowded city is very unfavourable unless the church happen to stand out from the houses which form the street the most eligible situation for a clock is that it should project considerably into the street at some elevation with a dialplate on each side like that which belonged to the old church of st dunstan in fleet street so that passengers in both directions would have their attention directed to the hour  a similar remark applies with much greater force to the present defective mode of informing the public of the position of the receiving houses for the twopenny and general post in the lowest corner of the window of some attractive shop is found a small slit with a brass plate indicating its important office so obscurely that it seems to be an object rather to prevent its being conspicuous no striking sign assists the anxious enquirer who as the moments rapidly pass which precede the hour of closing torments the passenger with his enquiries for the nearest postoffice he reaches it perhaps just as it is closed; and must then either hasten to a distant part of the town in order to procure the admission of his letters or give up the idea of forwarding them by that post; and thus if they are foreign letters he may lose perhaps a week or a fortnight by waiting for the next packet the inconvenience in this and in some other cases is of perpetual and everyday occurrence; and though in the greater part of the individual cases it may be of trifling moment the sum of all these produces an amount which it is always worthy of the government of a large and active population to attend to the remedy is simple and obvious it would only be necessary at each letterbox to have a light frame of iron projecting from the house over the pavement and carrying the letters g p or t p or any other distinctive sign all private signs are at present very properly prohibited from projecting into the street the passenger therefore would at once know where to direct his attention in order to discover a postoffice; and those letterboxes which occurred in the great thoroughfares could not fail to be generally known  chapter  exerting forces too great for human power and executing operations too delicate for human touch  it requires some skill and a considerable apparatus to enable many men to exert their whole force at a given point; and when this number amounts to hundreds or to thousands additional difficulties present themselves if ten thousand men were hired to act simultaneously it would be exceedingly difficult to discover whether each exerted his whole force and consequently to be assured that each man did the duty for which he was paid and if still larger bodies of men or animals were necessary not only would the difficulty of directing them become greater but the expense would increase from the necessity of transporting food for their subsistence the difficulty of enabling a large number of men to exert their force at the same instant of time has been almost obviated by the use of sound the whistle of the boatswain performs this service on board ships; and in removing by manual force the vast mass of granite weighing above tons on which the equestrian figure of peter the great is placed at st petersburgh a drummer was always stationed on its summit to give the signal for the united efforts of the workmen an ancient egyptian drawing was discovered a few years since by champollion in which a multitude of men appeared harnessed to a huge block of stone on the top of which stood a single individual with his hands raised above his head apparently in the act of clapping them for the purpose of insuring the exertion of their combined force at the same moment of time  in mines it is sometimes necessary to raise or lower great weights by capstans requiring the force of more than one hundred men these work upon the surface; but the directions must be communicated from below perhaps from the depth of two hundred fathoms this communication however is accomplished with ease and certainty by signals the usual apparatus is a kind of clapper placed on the surface close to the capstan so that every man may hear and put in motion from below by a rope passing up the shaft at wheal friendship mine in cornwall a different contrivance is employed there is in that mine an inclined plane passing underground about twothirds of a mile in length signals are communicated by a continuous rod of metal which being struck below the blow is distinctly heard on the surface  in all our larger manufactories numerous instances occur of the application of the power of steam to overcome resistances which it would require far greater expense to surmount by means of animal labour the twisting of the largest cables the rolling hammering and cutting large masses of iron the draining of our mines all require enormous exertions of physical force continued for considerable periods of time other means are had recourse to when the force required is great and the space through which it is to act is small the hydraulic press of bramah can by the exertion of one man produce a pressure of atmospheres; and with such an instrument a hollow cylinder of wrought iron three inches thick has been burst in rivetting together the iron plates out of which steamengine boilers are made it is necessary to produce as close a joint as possible this is accomplished by using the rivets redhot while they are in that state the two plates of iron are rivetted together and the contraction which the rivet undergoes in cooling draws them together with a force which is only limited by the tenacity of the metal of which the rivet itself is made  it is not alone in the greater operations of the engineer or the manufacturer that those vast powers which man has called into action in availing himself of the agency of steam are fully developed wherever the individual operation demanding little force for its own performance is to be multiplied in almost endless repetition commensurate power is required it is the same 'giant arm' which twists 'the largest cable' that spins from the cotton plant an 'almost gossamer thread' obedient to the hand which called into action its resistless powers it contends with the ocean and the storm and rides triumphant through dangers and difficulties unattempted by the older modes of navigation it is the same engine that in its more regulated action weaves the canvas it may one day supersede or with almost fairy fingers entwines the meshes of the most delicate fabric that adorns the female form*  the fifth report of the select committee of the house of commons on the holyhead roads furnishes ample proof of the great superiority of steam vessels the following extracts are taken from the evidence of captain rogers the commander of one of the packets question are you not perfectly satisfied from the experience you have had that the steam vessel you command is capable of performing what no sailing vessel can do? answer yes question during your passage from gravesend to the downs could any squarerigged vessel from a firstrate down to a sloop of war have performed the voyage you did in the time

question at the time you performed that voyage with the weather you have described from the downs to milford if that weather had continued twelve months would any squarerigged vessel have performed it? answer they would have been a long time about it probably would have been weeks instead of days a sailing vessel would not have beat up to milford as we did in twelve months  the process of printing on the silver paper which is necessary for banknotes is attended with some inconvenience from the necessity of damping the paper previously to taking the impression it was difficult to do this uniformly and in the old process of dipping a parcel of several sheets together into a vessel of water the outside sheets becoming much more wet than the others were very apt to be torn a method has been adopted at the bank of ireland which obviates this inconvenience the whole quantity of paper to be damped is placed in a close vessel from which the air is exhausted; water is then admitted and every leaf is completely wetted; the paper is then removed to a press and all the superfluous moisture is squeezed out  the operation of pulverizing solid substances and of separating the powders of various degrees of fineness is common in the arts and as the best graduated sifting fails in effecting this separation with sufficient delicacy recourse is had to suspension in a fluid medium the substance when reduced by grinding to the finest powder is agitated in water which is then drawn off the coarsest portion of the suspended matter first subsides and that which requires the longest time to fall down is the finest in this manner even emery powder a substance of great density is separated into the various degrees of fineness which are required flints after being burned and ground are suspended in water in order to mix them intimately with clay which is also suspended in the same fluid for the formation of porcelain the water is then in part evaporated by heat and the plastic compound out of which our most beautiful porcelain is formed remains it is a curious fact and one which requires further examination than it has yet received that if this mixture be suffered to remain long at rest before it is worked up it becomes useless; for it is then found that the silex which at first was uniformly mixed becomes aggregated together in small lumps this parallel to the formation of flints in the chalk strata deserves attention*  the slowness with which powders subside depends partly on the specific gravity of the substance and partly on the magnitude of the particles themselves bodies in falling through a resisting medium after a certain time acquire a uniform velocity which is called their terminal velocity with which they continue to descend when the particles are very small and the medium dense as water this terminal velocity is soon arrived at some of the finer powders even of emery require several hours to subside through a few feet of water and the mud pumped up into our cisterns by some of the water companies is suspended during a still longer time these facts furnish us with some idea of the great extent over which deposits of river mud may be spread; for if the mud of any river whose waters enter the gulf stream sink through one foot in an hour it might be carried by that stream miles before it had sunk to the depth of or feet  a number of small filaments of cotton project from even the best spun thread and when this thread is woven into muslin they injure its appearance to cut these off separately is quite impossible but they are easily removed by passing the muslin rapidly over a cylinder of iron kept at a dull red heat the time during which each portion of the muslin is in contact with the redhot iron is too short to heat it to the burning point; but the filaments being much finer and being pressed close to the hot metal are burnt the removal of these filaments from patent net is still more necessary for its perfection the net is passed at a moderate velocity through a flame of gas issuing from a very long and narrow slit immediately above the flame a long funnel is fixed which is connected with a large airpump worked by a steamengine the flame is thus drawn forcibly through the net and all the filaments on both sides of it are burned off at one operation previously to this application of the airpump the net acting in the same way although not to the same extent as the wiregauze in davy's safety lamp cooled down the flame so as to prevent the combustion of the filaments on the upper side the airpump by quickening the current of ignited gas removes this inconvenience notes  the importance and diversified applications of the steam engine were most ably enforced in the speeches made at a public meeting held june for the purpose of proposing the erection of a monument to the memory of james watt; these were subsequently printed  some observations on the subject by dr fitton occur in the appendix to captain king's survey of the coast of australia vol ii p london chapter  registering operations  one great advantage which we may derive from machinery is from the check which it affords against the inattention the idleness or the dishonesty of human agents few occupations are more wearisome than counting a series of repetitions of the same fact; the number of paces we walk affords a tolerably good measure of distance passed over but the value of this is much enhanced by possessing an instrument the pedometer which will count for us the number of steps we have made a piece of mechanism of this kind is sometimes applied to count the number of turns made by the wheel of a carriage and thus to indicate the distance travelled an instrument similar in its object but differing in its construction has been used for counting the number of strokes made by a steamengine and the number of coins struck in a press one of the simplest instruments for counting any series of operations was contrived by mr donkin*  another instrument for registering is used in some establishments for calendering and embossing many hundred thousand yards of calicoes and stuffs undergo these operations weekly; and as the price paid for the process is small the value of the time spent in measuring them would bear a considerable proportion to the profit a machine has therefore been contrived for measuring and registering the length of the goods as they pass rapidly through the hands of the operator by which all chance of erroneous counting is avoided  perhaps the most useful contrivance of this kind is one for ascertaining the vigilance of a watchman it is a piece of mechanism connected with a clock placed in an apartment to which the watchman has not access; but he is ordered to pull a string situated in a certain part of his round once in every hour the instrument aptly called a telltale informs the owner whether the man has missed any and what hours during the night  it is often of great importance both for regulations of excise as well as for the interest of the proprietor to know the quantity of spirits or of other liquors which have been drawn off by those persons who are allowed to have access to the vessels during the absence of the inspectors or principals this may be accomplished by a peculiar kind of stopcockwhich will at each opening discharge only a certain measure of fluid the number of times the cock has been turned being registered by a counting apparatus accessible only to the master  the time and labour consumed in gauging the contents of casks partly filled has led to an improvement which by the simplest means obviates a considerable inconvenience and enables any person to read off on a scale the number of gallons contained in any vessel as readily as he does the degree of heat indicated by his thermometer a small stopcock connects the bottom of the cask with a glass tube of narrow bore fixed to a scale on the side of the cask and rising a little above its top the plug of the cock may be turned into three positions in the first it cuts off all communication with the cask in the second it opens a communication between the cask and the glass tube and in the third it cuts off the connection between the cask and the tube and opens a communication between the tube and any vessel held beneath the cock to receive its contents the scale of the tube is graduated by pouring into the cask successive quantities of water while the communication between the cask and the tube is open lines are then drawn on the scale opposite the places in the tube to which the water rises at each addition and the scale being thus formed by actual measurement* the contents of each cask are known by inspection and the tedious process of gauging is altogether dispensed with other advantages accrue from this simple contrivance in the great economy of time which it introduces in making mixtures of different spirits in taking stock and in receiving spirit from the distiller  the gasmeter by which the quantity of gas used by each consumer is ascertained is another instrument of this kind they are of various forms but all of them intended to register the number of cubic feet of gas which has been delivered it is very desirable that these meters should be obtainable at a moderate price and that every consumer should employ them; because by making each purchaser pay only for what he consumes and by preventing that extravagant waste of gas which we frequently observe the manufacturer of gas will be enabled to make an equal profit at a diminished price to the consumer  the sale of water by the different companies in london might also with advantage be regulated by a meter if such a system were adopted much water which is now allowed to run to waste would be saved and an unjust inequality between the rates charged on different houses by the same company be avoided  another most important object to which a meter might be applied would be to register the quantity of water passing into the boilers of steamengines without this our knowledge of the quantity evaporated by different boilers and with fireplaces of different constructions as well as our estimation of the duty of steamengines must evidently be imperfect  another purpose to which machinery for registering operations is applied with much advantage is the determination of the average effect of natural or artificial agents the mean height of the barometer for example is ascertained by noting its height at a certain number of intervals during the twentyfour hours the more these intervals are contracted the more correctly will the mean be ascertained; but the true mean ought to be influenced by each momentary change which has occurred clocks have been proposed and made with this object by which a sheet of paper is moved slowly and uniformly before a pencil fixed to a float upon the surface of the mercury in the cup of the barometer sir david brewster proposed several years ago to suspend a barometer and swing it as a pendulum the variations in the atmosphere would thus alter the centre of oscillation and the comparison of such an instrument with a good clock would enable us to ascertain the mean altitude of the barometer during any interval of the observer's absence* an instrument for measuring and registering the quantity of rain was invented by mr john taylor and described by him in the philosophical magazine it consists of an apparatus in which a vessel that receives the rain falling into the reservoir tilts over as soon as it is full and then presents another similar vessel to be filled which in like manner when full tilts the former one back again the number of times these vessels are emptied is registered by a train of wheels; and thus without the presence of the observer the quantity of rain falling during a whole year may be measured and recorded instruments might also be contrived to determine the average force of traction of horsesof the windof a stream or of any irregular and fluctuating effort of animal or other natural force  clocks and watches may be considered as instruments for registering the number of vibrations performed by a pendulum or a balance the mechanism by which these numbers are counted is technically called a scapement it is not easy to describe but the various contrivances which have been adopted for this purpose are amongst the most interesting and most ingenious to which mechanical science has given birth working models on an enlarged scale are almost necessary to make their action understood by the unlearned reader; and unfortunately these are not often to be met with a very fine collection of such models exists amongst the collection of instruments at the university of prague instruments of this kind have been made to extend their action over considerable periods of time and to register not merely the hour of the day but the days of the week of the month of the year and also to indicate the occurrence of several astronomical phenomena repeating clocks and watches may be considered as instruments for registering time which communicate their information only when the owner requires it by pulling a string or by some similar application an apparatus has recently been applied to watches by which the hand which indicates seconds leaves a small dot of ink on the dialplate whenever a certain stop or detent is pushed in thus whilst the eye is attentively fixed on the phenomenon to be observed the finger registers on the face of the watchdial the commencement and the end of its appearance  several instruments have been contrived for awakening the attention of the observer at times previously fixed upon the various kinds of alarums connected with clocks and watches are of this kind in some instances it is desirable to be able to set them so as to give notice at many successive and distant points of time such as those of the arrival of given stars on the meridian a clock of this kind is used at the royal observatory at greenwich  an earthquake is a phenomenon of such frequent occurrence and so interesting both from its fearful devastations as well as from its connection with geological theories that it becomes important to possess an instrument which shall if possible indicate the direction of the shock as well as its intensity an observation made a few years since at odessa after an earthquake which happened during the night suggests a simple instrument by which the direction of the shock may be determined a glass vase partly filled with water stood on the table of a room in a house at odessa; and from the coldness of the glass the inner part of the vessel above the water was coated with dew several very perceptible shocks of an earthquake happened between three and four o'clock in the morning; and when the observer got up he remarked that the dew was brushed off at two opposite sides of the glass by a wave which the earthquake had caused in the water the line joining the two highest points of this wave was of course that in which the shock travelled this circumstance which was accidentally noticed by an engineer at odessa* suggests the plan of keeping in countries subject to earthquakes glass vessels partly filled with treacle or some unctuous fluid so that when any lateral motion is communicated to them from the earth the adhesion of the liquid to the glass shall enable the observer after some interval of time to determine the direction of the shock in order to obtain some measure of the vertical oscillation of the earth a weight might be attached to a spiral spring or a pendulum might be sustained in a horizontal position and a sliding index be moved by either of them so that the extreme deviations should be indicated by it this however would not give even the comparative measure accurately because a difference in the velocity of the rising or falling of the earth's surface would affect the instrument notes  transactions of the society of arts p  the contrivance is due to mr hencky of high holborn in whose establishment it is in constant use  about seven or eight years since without being aware of sir david brewster's proposal i adapted a barometer as a pendulum to the works of a common eight day clock it remained in my library for several months but i have mislaid the observations which were made  memoires de l'academie des sciences de petersburgh e serie tom i p chapter  economy of the materials employed  the precision with which all operations by machinery are executed and the exact similarity of the articles thus made produce a degree of economy in the consumption of the raw material which is in some cases of great importance the earliest mode of cutting the trunk of a tree into planks was by the use of the hatchet or the adze it might perhaps be first split into three or four portions and then each portion was reduced to a uniform surface by those instruments with such means the quantity of plank produced would probably not equal the quantity of the raw material wasted by the process and if the planks were thin would certainly fall far short of it an improved tool completely reverses the case in converting a tree into thick planks the saw causes a waste of a very small fractional part; and even in reducing it to planks of only an inch in thickness does not waste more than an eighth part of the raw material when the thickness of the plank is still further reduced as is the case in cutting wood for veneering the quantity of material destroyed again begins to bear a considerable proportion to that which is used; and hence circular saws having a very thin blade have been employed for such purposes in order to economize still further the more valuable woods mr brunel contrived a machine which by a system of blades cut off the veneer in a continuous shaving thus rendering the whole of the piece of timber available  the rapid improvements which have taken place in the printing press during the last twenty years afford another instance of saving in the materials consumed which has been well ascertained by measurement and is interesting from its connection with literature in the old method of inking type by large hemispherical balls stuffed and covered with leather the printer after taking a small portion of ink from the inkblock was continually rolling the balls in various directions against each other in order that a thin layer of ink might be uniformly spread over their surface this he again transferred to the type by a kind of rolling action in such a process even admitting considerable skill in the operator it could not fail to happen that a large quantity of ink should get near the edges of the balls which not being transferred to the type became hard and useless and was taken off in the form of a thick black crust another inconvenience also arosethe quantity of ink spread on the block not being regulated by measure and the number and direction of the transits of the inkingballs over each other depending on the will of the operator and being consequently irregular it was impossible to place on the type a uniform layer of ink of the quantity exactly sufficient for the impression the introduction of cylindrical rollers of an elastic substance formed by the mixture of glue and treacle superseded the inkingballs and produced considerable saving in the consumption of ink but the most perfect economy was only to be produced by mechanism when printingpresses moved by the power of steam were introduced the action of these rollers was found to be well adapted to their performance; and a reservoir of ink was formed from which a roller regularly abstracted a small quantity at each impression from three to five other rollers spread this portion uniformly over a slab by most ingenious contrivances varied in almost each kind of press and another travelling roller having fed itself on the slab passed and repassed over the type just before it gave the impression to the paper in order to shew that this plan of inking puts the proper quantity of ink upon the type we must prove firstthat the quantity is not too little this would soon have been discovered from the complaints of the public and the booksellers; and secondly that it is not too great this latter point was satisfactorily established by an experiment a few hours after one side of a sheet of paper has been printed upon the ink is sufficiently dry to allow it to receive the impression upon the other; and as considerable pressure is made use of the tympan on which the side first printed is laid is guarded from soiling it by a sheet of paper called the setoff sheet this paper receives in succession every sheet of the work to be printed acquiring from them more or less of the ink according to their dryness or the quantity upon them it was necessary in the former process after about one hundred impressions to change this setoff sheet which then became too much soiled for further use in the new method of printing by machinery no such sheet is used but a blanket is employed as its substitute; this does not require changing above once in five thousand impressions and instances have occurred of its remaining sufficiently clean for twenty thousand here then is a proof that the quantity of superfluous ink put upon the paper in machineprinting is so small that if multiplied by five thousand and in some instances even by twenty thousand it is only sufficient to render useless a single piece of clean cloth* the following were the results of an accurate experiment upon the effect of the process just described made at one of the largest printing establishments in the metropolis* two hundred reams of paper were printed off the old method of inking with balls being employed; two hundred reams of the same paper and for the same book were then printed off in the presses which inked their own type the consumption of ink by the machine was to that by the balls as four to nine or rather less than onehalf notes  in the very best kind of printing it is necessary in the old method to change the setoff sheet once in twelve times in printing the same kind of work by machinery the blanket is changed once in  this experiment was made at the establishment of mr clowes in stamford street  chapter  of the identity of the work when it is of the same kind and its accuracy when of different kinds  nothing is more remarkable and yet less unexpected than the perfect identity of things manufactured by the same tool if the top of a circular box is to be made to fit over the lower part it may be done in the lathe by gradually advancing the tool of the slidingrest; the proper degree of tightness between the box and its lid being found by trial after this adjustment if a thousand boxes are made no additional care is required; the tool is always carried up to the stop and each box will be equally adapted to every lid the same identity pervades all the arts of printing; the impressions from the same block or the same copperplate have a similarity which no labour could produce by hand the minutest traces are transferred to all the impressions and no omission can arise from the inattention or unskilfulness of the operator the steel punch with which the cardwadding for a fowlingpiece is cut if it once perform its office with accuracy constantly reproduces the same exact circle  the accuracy with which machinery executes its work is perhaps one of its most important advantages it may however be contended that a considerable portion of this advantage may be resolved into saving of time; for it generally happens that any improvement in tools increases the quantity of work done in a given time without tools that is by the mere efforts of the human hand there are undoubtedly multitudes of things which it would be impossible to make add to the human hand the rudest cutting instrument and its powers are enlarged the fabrication of many things then becomes easy and that of others possible with great labour add the saw to the knife or the hatchet and other works become possible and a new course of difficult operations is brought into view whilst many of the former are rendered easy this observation is applicable even to the most perfect tools or machines it would be possible for a very skilful workman with files and polishing substances to form a cylinder out of a piece of steel; but the time which this would require would be so considerable and the number of failures would probably be so great that for all practical purposes such a mode of producing a steel cylinder might be said to be impossible the same process by the aid of the lathe and the slidingrest is the everyday employment of hundreds of workmen  of all the operations of mechanical art that of turning is the most perfect if two surfaces are worked against each other whatever may have been their figure at the commencement there exists a tendency in them both to become portions of spheres either of them may become convex and the other concave with various degrees of curvature a plane surface is the line of separation between convexity and concavity and is most difficult to hit; it is more easy to make a good circle than to produce a straight line a similar difficulty takes place in figuring specula for telescopes; the parabola is the surface which separates the hyperbolic from the elliptic figure and is the most difficult to form if a spindle not cylindrical at its end be pressed into a hole not circular and kept constantly turning there is a tendency in these two bodies so situated to become conical or to have circular sections if a triangularpointed piece of iron be worked round in a circular hole the edges will gradually wear and it will become conical these facts if they do not explain at least illustrate the principles on which the excellence of work formed in the lathe depends  chapter  of copying  the two lastmentioned sources of excellence in the work produced by machinery depend on a principle which pervades a very large portion of all manufactures and is one upon which the cheapness of the articles produced seems greatly to depend the principle alluded to is that of copying taken in its most extensive sense almost unlimited pains are in some instances bestowed on the original from which a series of copies is to be produced; and the larger the number of these copies the more care and pains can the manufacturer afford to lavish upon the original it may thus happen that the instrument or tool actually producing the work shall cost five or even ten thousand times the price of each individual specimen of its power as the system of copying is of so much importance and of such extensive use in the arts it will be convenient to classify a considerable number of those processes in which it is employed the following enumeration however is not offered as a complete list; and the explanations are restricted to the shortest possible detail which is consistent with a due regard to making the subject intelligible operations of copying are effected under the following circumstances by printing from cavities   by stamping by printing from surface  by punching by casting     with elongation by moulding    with altered dimensions  of printing from cavities  the art of printing in all its numerous departments is essentially an art of copying under its two great divisions printing from hollow lines as in copperplate and printing from surface as in block printing are comprised numerous arts  copperplate printing in this instance the copies are made by transferring to paper by means of pressure a thick ink from the hollows and lines cut in the copper an artist will sometimes exhaust the labour of one or two years upon engraving a plate which will not in some cases furnish above five hundred copies in a state of perfection  engravings on steel this art is like that of engraving on copper except that the number of copies is far less limited a banknote engraved as a copperplate will not give above three thousand impressions without a sensible deterioration two impressions of a banknote engraved on steel were examined by one of our most eminent artists* who found it difficult to pronounce with any confidence which was the earliest impression one of these was a proof from amongst the first thousand the other was taken after between seventy and eighty thousand had been printed off  music printing music is usually printed from pewter plates on which the characters have been impressed by steel punches the metal being much softer than copper is liable to scratches which detain a small portion of the ink this is the reason of the dirty appearance of printed music a new process has recently been invented by mr cowper by which this inconvenience will be avoided the improved method which give sharpness to the characters is still an art of copying; but it is effected by surface printing nearly in the same manner as calicoprinting from blocks to be described hereafter the method of printing music from pewter plates although by far the most frequently made use of is not the only one employed for music is occasionally printed from stone sometimes also it is printed with moveable type; and occasionally the musical characters are printed on the paper and the lines printed afterwards specimens of both these latter modes of musicprinting may be seen in the splendid collection of impressions from the types of the press of bodoni at parma but notwithstanding the great care bestowed on the execution of that work the perpetual interruption of continuity in the lines arising from the use of moveable types when the characters and lines are printed at the same time is apparent  calico printing from cylinders many of the patterns on printed calicos are copies by printing from copper cylinders about four or five inches in diameter on which the desired pattern has been previously engraved one portion of the cylinders is exposed to the ink whilst an elastic scraper of very thin steel by being pressed forcibly against another part removes all superfluous ink from the surface previously to its reaching the cloth a piece of calico twentyeight yards in length rolls through this press and is printed in four or five minutes  printing from perforated sheets of metal or stencilling very thin brass is sometimes perforated in the form of letters usually those of a name; this is placed on any substance which it is required to mark and a brush dipped in some paint is passed over the brass those parts which are cut away admit the paint and thus a copy of the name appears on the substance below this method which affords rather a coarse copy is sometimes used for paper with which rooms are covered and more especially for the borders if a portion be required to match an old pattern this is perhaps the most economical way of producing it  coloured impressions of leaves upon paper may be made by a kind of surface printing such leaves are chosen as have considerable inequalities the elevated parts of these are covered by means of an inking ball with a mixture of some pigment ground up in linseed oil; the leaf is then placed between two sheets of paper and being gently pressed the impression from the elevated parts on each side appear on the corresponding sheets of paper  the beautiful red cotton handkerchiefs dyed at glasgow have their pattern given to them by a process similar to stencilling except that instead of printing from a pattern the reverse operation that of discharging a part of the colour from a cloth already dyedis performed a number of handkerchiefs are pressed with very great force between two plates of metal which are similarly perforated with round or lozengeshaped holes according to the intended pattern the upper plate of metal is surrounded by a rim and a fluid which has the property of discharging the red dye is poured upon that plate this liquid passes through the holes in the metal and also through the calico; but owing to the great pressure opposite all the parts of the plates not cut away it does not spread itself beyond the pattern after this the handkerchiefs are washed and the pattern of each is a copy of the perforations in the metalplate used in the process another mode by which a pattern is formed by discharging colour from a previously dyed cloth is to print on it a pattern with paste; then passing it into the dyingvat it comes out dyed of one uniform colour but the paste has protected the fibres of the cotton from the action of the dye or mordant; and when the cloth so dyed is well washed the paste is dissolved and leaves uncoloured all those parts of the cloth to which it was applied  printing from surface  this second department of printing is of more frequent application in the arts than that which has just been considered  printing from wooden blocks a block of box wood is in this instance the substance out of which the pattern is formed the design being sketched upon it the workman cuts away with sharp tools every part except the lines to be represented in the impression this is exactly the reverse of the process of engraving on copper in which every line to be represented is cut away the ink instead of filling the cavities cut in the wood is spread upon the surface which remains and is thence transferred to the paper  printing from moveable types this is the most important in its influence of all the arts of copying it possesses a singular peculiarity in the immense subdivision of the parts that form the pattern after that pattern has furnished thousands of copies the same individual elements may be arranged again and again in other forms and thus supply multitudes of originals from each of which thousands of their copied impressions may flow it also possesses this advantage that woodcuts may be used along with the letterpress and impressions taken from both at the same operation  printing from stereotype this mode of producing copies is very similar to the preceding there are two modes by which stereotype plates are produced in that most generally adopted a mould is taken in plaster from the moveable types and in this the stereotype plate is cast another method has been employed in france instead of composing the work in moveable type it was set up in moveable copper matrices; each matrix being in fact a piece of copper of the same size as the type and having the impression of the letter sunk into its surface instead of projecting in relief a stereotype plate may it is evident be obtained at once from this arrangement of matrices the objection to the plan is the great expense of keeping so large a collection of matrices as the original composition does not readily admit of change stereotype plates can only be applied with advantage to cases where an extraordinary number of copies are demanded or where the work consists of figures and it is of great importance to ensure accuracy trifling alterations may however be made in it from time to time; and thus mathematical tables may by the gradual extirpation of error at last become perfect this mode of producing copies possesses in common with that by moveable types the advantage of admitting the use of woodcuts the copy of the woodcut in the stereotype plate being equally perfect with that of the moveable type this union is of considerable importance and cannot be accomplished with engravings on copper  lettering books the gilt letters on the backs of books are formed by placing a piece of gold leaf upon the leather and pressing upon it brass letters previously heated these cause the gold immediately under them to adhere to the leather whilst the rest of the metal is easily brushed away when a great number of copies of the same volume are to be lettered it is found to be cheaper to have a brass pattern cut with the whole of the proper title this is placed in a press and being kept hot the covers each having a small bit of leafgold placed in the proper position are successively brought under the brass and stamped the lettering at the back of the volume in the reader's hand was executed in this manner  calico printing from blocks this is a mode of copying by surface printing from the ends of small pieces of copper wire of various forms fixed into a block of wood they are all of one uniform height about the eighth part of an inch above the surface of the wood and are arranged by the maker into any required pattern if the block be placed upon a piece of fine woollen cloth on which ink of any colour has been uniformly spread the projecting copper wires receive a portion which they give up when applied to the calico to be printed by the former method of printing on calico only one colour could be used; but by this plan after the flower of a rose for example has been printed with one set of blocks the leaves may be printed of another colour by a different set  printing oilcloth after the canvas which forms the basis of oilcloth has been covered with paint of one uniform tint the remainder of the processes which it passes through are a series of copyings by surface printing from patterns formed upon wooden blocks very similar to those employed by the calico printer each colour requiring a distinct set of blocks those oilcloths with the greatest variety of colours are most expensive there are several other varieties of printing which we shall briefly notice as arts of copying; which although not strictly surface printing yet are more allied to it than that from copperplates  letter copying in one of the modes of performing this process a sheet of very thin paper is damped and placed upon the writing to be copied the two papers are then passed through a rolling press and a portion of the ink from one paper is transferred to the other the writing is of course reversed by this process; but the paper to which it is transferred being thin the characters are seen through it on the other side in their proper position another common mode of copying letters is by placing a sheet of paper covered on both sides with a substance prepared from lampblack between a sheet of thin paper and the paper on which the letter to be despatched is to be written if the upper or thin sheet be written upon with any hard pointed substance the word written with this style will be impressed from the black paper upon both those adjoining it the translucency of the upper sheet which is retained by the writer is in this instance necessary to render legible the writing which is on the back of the paper both these arts are very limited in their extent the former affording two or three the latter from two to perhaps ten or fifteen copies at the same time  printing on china this is an art of copying which is carried to a very great extent as the surfaces to which the impression is to be conveyed are often curved and sometimes even fluted the ink or paint is first transferred from the copper to some flexible substance such as paper or an elastic compound of glue and treacle it is almost immediately conveyed from this to the unbaked biscuit to which it more readily adheres  lithographic printing this is another mode of producing copies in almost unlimited number the original which supplies the copies is a drawing made on a stone of a slightly porous nature the ink employed for tracing it is made of such greasy materials that when water is poured over the stone it shall not wet the lines of the drawing when a roller covered with printing ink which is of an oily nature is passed over the stone previously wetted the water prevents this ink from adhering to the uncovered portions; whilst the ink used in the drawing is of such a nature that the printing ink adheres to it in this state if a sheet of paper be placed upon the stone and then passed under a press the printing ink will be transferred to the paper leaving the ink used in the drawing still adhering to the stone  there is one application of lithographic printing which does not appear to have received sufficient attention and perhaps further experiments are necessary to bring it to perfection it is the reprinting of works which have just arrived from other countries a few years ago one of the paris newspapers was reprinted at brussels as soon as it arrived by means of lithography whilst the ink is yet fresh this may easily be accomplished it is only necessary to place one copy of the newspaper on a lithographic stone; and by means of great pressure applied to it in a rolling press a sufficient quantity of the printing ink will be transferred to the stone by similar means the other side of the newspaper may be copied on another stone and these stones will then furnish impressions in the usual way if printing from stone could be reduced to the same price per thousand as that from moveable types this process might be adopted with great advantage for the supply of works for the use of distant countries possessing the same language for a single copy might be printed off with transfer ink and thus an english work for example might be published in america from stone whilst the original printed from moveable types made its appearance on the same day in england  it is much to be wished that such a method were applicable to the reprinting of facsimiles of old and scarce books this however would require the sacrifice of two copies since a leaf must be destroyed for each page such a method of reproducing a small impression of an old work is peculiarly applicable to mathematical tables the setting up of which in type is always expensive and liable to error but how long ink will continue to be transferable to stone from paper on which it has been printed must be determined by experiment the destruction of the greasy or oily portion of the ink in the character of old books seems to present the greatest impediment; if one constituent only of the ink were removed by time it might perhaps be hoped that chemical means would ultimately be discovered for restoring it but if this be unsuccessful an attempt might be made to discover some substance having a strong affinity for the carbon of the ink which remains on the paper and very little for the paper itself*  lithographic prints have occasionally been executed in colours in such instances a separate stone seems to have been required for each colour and considerable care or very good mechanism must have been employed to adjust the paper to each stone if any two kinds of ink should be discovered mutually inadhesive one stone might be employed for two inks; or if the inkingroller for the second and subsequent colours had portions cut away corresponding to those parts of the stone inked by the previous ones then several colours might be printed from the same stone but these principles do not appear to promise much except for coarse subjects  register printing it is sometimes thought necessary to print from a wooden block or stereotype plate the same pattern reversed upon the opposite side of the paper the effect of this which is technically called register printing is to make it appear as if the ink had penetrated through the paper and rendered the pattern visible on the other side if the subject chosen contains many fine lines it seems at first sight extremely difficult to effect so exact a super position of the two patterns on opposite sides of the same piece of paper that it shall be impossible to detect the slightest deviation; yet the process is extremely simple the block which gives the impression is always accurately brought down to the same place by means of a hinge; this spot is covered by a piece of thin leather stretched over it; the block is now inked and being brought down to its place gives an impression of the pattern to the leather it is then turned back; and being inked a second time the paper intended to be printed is placed upon the leather when the block again descending the upper surface of the paper is printed from the block and its undersurface takes up the impression from the leather it is evident that the perfection of this mode of printing depends in a great measure on finding some soft substance like leather which will take as much ink as it ought from the block and which will give it up most completely to paper impressions thus obtained are usually fainter on the lower side; and in order in some measure to remedy this defect rather more ink is put on the block at the first than at the second impression  of copying by casting  the art of casting by pouring substances in a fluid state into a mould which retains them until they become solid is essentially an art of copying; the form of the thing produced depending entirely upon that of the pattern from which it was formed  of casting iron and other metalspatterns of wood or metal made from drawings are the originals from which the moulds for casting are made so that in fact the casting itself is a copy of the mould; and the mould is a copy of the pattern in castings of iron and metals for the coarser purposes and if they are afterwards to be worked even for the finer machines the exact resemblance amongst the things produced which takes place in many of the arts to which we have alluded is not effected in the first instance nor is this necessary as the metals shrink in cooling the pattern is made larger than the intended copy; and in extricating it from the sand in which it is moulded some little difference will occur in the size of the cavity which it leaves in smaller works where accuracy is more requisite and where few or no after operations are to be performed a mould of metal is employed which has been formed with considerable care thus in casting bullets which ought to be perfectly spherical and smooth an iron instrument is used in which a cavity has been cut and carefully ground; and in order to obviate the contraction in cooling a jet is left which may supply the deficiency of metal arising from that cause and which is afterwards cut off the leaden toys for children are cast in brass moulds which open and in which have been graved or chiselled the figures intended to be produced  a very beautiful mode of representing small branches of the most delicate vegetable productions in bronze has been employed by mr chantrey a small strip of a firtree a branch of holly a curled leaf of broccoli or any other vegetable production is suspended by one end in a small cylinder of paper which is placed for support within a similarly formed tin case the finest river silt carefully separated from all the coarser particles and mixed with water so as to have the consistency of cream is poured into the paper cylinder by small portions at a time carefully shaking the plant a little after each addition in order that its leaves may be covered and that no bubbles of air may be left the plant and its mould are now allowed to dry and the yielding nature of the paper allows the loamy coating to shrink from the outside when this is dry it is surrounded by a coarser substance; and finally we have the twig with all its leaves embedded in a perfect mould this mould is carefully dried and then gradually heated to a red heat at the ends of some of the leaves or shoots wires have been left to afford airholes by their removal and in this state of strong ignition a stream of air is directed into the hole formed by the end of the branch the consequence is that the wood and leaves which had been turned into charcoal by the fire are now converted into carbonic acid by the current of air; and after some time the whole of the solid matter of which the plant consisted is completely removed leaving a hollow mould bearing on its interior all the minutest traces of its late vegetable occupant when this process is completed the mould being still kept at nearly a red heat receives the fluid metal which by its weight either drives the very small quantity of air which at that high temperature remains behind out through the airholes or compresses it into the pores of very porous substance of which the mould is formed  when the form of the object intended to be cast is such that the pattern cannot be extricated from its mould of sand or plaster it becomes necessary to make the pattern with wax or some other easily fusible substance the sand or plaster is moulded round this pattern and by the application of heat the wax is extricated through an opening left purposely for its escape  it is often desirable to ascertain the form of the internal cavities inhabited by molluscous animals such as those of spiral shells and of the various corals this may be accomplished by filling them with fusible metal and dissolving the substance of the shell by muriatic acid; thus a metallic solid will remain which exactly filled all the cavities if such forms are required in silver or any other difficulty fusible metal the shells may be filled with wax or resin then dissolved away; and the remaining waxen form may serve as the pattern from which a plaster mould may be made for casting the metal some nicety will be required in these operations; and perhaps the minuter cavities can only be filled under an exhausted receiver  casting in plaster this is a mode of copying applied to a variety of purposes to produce accurate representations of the human formof statuesor of rare fossilsto which latter purpose it has lately been applied with great advantage in all casting the first process is to make the mould; and plaster is the substance which is almost always employed for the purpose the property which it possesses of remaining for a short time in a state of fluidity renders it admirably adapted to this object and adhesion even to an original of plaster is effectually prevented by oiling the surface on which it is poured the mould formed round the subject which is copied removed in separate pieces and then reunited is that in which the copy is cast this process gives additional utility and value to the finest works of art the students of the academy at venice are thus enabled to admire the sculptured figures of egina preserved in the gallery at munich; as well as the marbles of the parthenon the pride of our own museum casts in plaster of the elgin marbles adorn many of the academies of the continent; and the liberal employment of such presents affords us an inexpensive and permanent source of popularity  casting in wax this mode of copying aided by proper colouring offers the most successful imitations of many objects of natural history and gives an air of reality to them which might deceive even the most instructed numerous figures of remarkable persons having the face and hands formed in wax have been exhibited at various times; and the resemblances have in some instances been most striking but whoever would see the art of copying in wax carried to the highest perfection should examine the beautiful collection of fruit at the house of the horticultural society; the model of the magnificent flower of the new genus rafflesiathe waxen models of the internal parts of the human body which adorn the anatomical gallery of the jardin des plantes at paris and the museum at florenceor the collection of morbid anatomy at the university of bologna the art of imitation by wax does not usually afford the multitude of copies which flow from many similar operations this number is checked by the subsequent stages of the process which ceasing to have the character of copying by a tool or pattern become consequently more expensive in each individual production form alone is given by casting; the colouring must be the work of the pencil guided by the skill of the artist  of copying by moulding  this method of producing multitudes of individuals having an exact resemblance to each other in external shape is adopted very widely in the arts the substances employed are either naturally or by artificial preparation in a soft or plastic state; they are then compressed by mechanical force sometimes assisted by heat into a mould of the required form  of bricks and tiles an oblong box of wood fitting upon a bottom fixed to the brickmaker's bench is the mould from which every brick is formed a portion of the plastic mixture of which the bricks consist is made ready by less skilful hands the workman first sprinkles a little sand into the mould and then throws the clay into it with some force; at the same time rapidly working it with his fingers so as to make it completely close up to the corners he next scrapes off with a wetted stick the superfluous clay and shakes the newformed brick dexterously out of its mould upon a piece of board on which it is removed by another workman to the place appointed for drying it a very skilful moulder has occasionally in a long summer's day delivered from ten to eleven thousand bricks; but a fair average day's work is from five to six thousand tiles of various kinds and forms are made of finer materials but by the same system of moulding among the ruins of the city of gour the ancient capital of bengal bricks are found having projecting ornaments in high relief these appear to have been formed in a mould and subsequently glazed with a coloured glaze in germany also brickwork has been executed with various ornaments the cornice of the church of st stephano at berlin is made of large blocks of brick moulded into the form required by the architect at the establishment of messrs cubitt in gray's inn lane vases cornices and highly ornamented capitals of columns are thus formed which rival stone itself in elasticity hardness and durability  of embossed china many of the forms given to those beautiful specimens of earthenware which constitute the equipage of our breakfast and our dinnertables cannot be executed in the lathe of the potter the embossed ornaments on the edges of the plates their polygonal shape the fluted surface of many of the vases would all be difficult and costly of execution by the hand; but they become easy and comparatively cheap when made by pressing the soft material out of which they are formed into a hard mould the care and skill bestowed on the preparation of that mould are repaid by the multitude it produces in many of the works of the china manufactory one part only of the article is moulded; the upper surface of the plate for example whilst the under side is figured by the lathe in some instances the handle or only a few ornaments are moulded and the body of the work is turned  glass seals the process of engraving upon gems requires considerable time and skill the seals thus produced can therefore never become common imitations however have been made of various degrees of resemblance the colour which is given to glass is perhaps the most successful part of the imitation a small cylindrical rod of coloured glass is heated in the flame of a blowpipe until the extremity becomes soft the operator then pinches it between the ends of a pair of nippers which are formed of brass and on one side of which the device intended for the seal has been carved in relief when the mould has been well finished and care is taken in heating the glass properly the seals thus produced are not bad imitations; and by this system of copying they are so multiplied that the more ordinary kinds are sold at birmingham for three pence a dozen  square glass bottles the round forms which are usually given to vessels of glass are readily produced by the expansion of the air with which they are blown it is however necessary in many cases to make bottles of a square form and each capable of holding exactly the same quantity of fluid it is also frequently desirable to have imprinted on them the name of the maker of the medicine or other liquid they are destined to contain a mould of iron or of copper is provided of the intended size on the inside of which are engraved the names required this mould which is used in a hot state opens into two parts to allow the insertion of the round unfinished bottle which is placed in it in a very soft state before it is removed from the end of the iron tube with which it was blown the mould is now closed and the glass is forced against its sides by blowing strongly into the bottle  wooden snuff boxes snuff boxes ornamented with devices in imitation of carved work or of rose engine turning are sold at a price which proves that they are only imitations the wood or horn out of which they are formed is softened by long boiling in water and whilst in this state it is forced into moulds of iron or steel on which are cut the requisite patterns where it remains exposed to great pressure until it is dry  horn knife handles and umbrella handles the property which horn possesses of becoming soft by the action of water and of heat fits it for many useful purposes it is pressed into moulds and becomes embossed with figures in relief adapted to the objects to which it is to be applied if curved it may be straightened; or if straight it may be bent into any forms which ornament or utility may require; and by the use of the mould these forms may be multiplied in endless variety the commoner sorts of knives the crooked handles for umbrellas and a multitude of other articles to which horn is applied attest the cheapness which the art of copying gives to the things formed of this material  moulding tortoiseshell the same principle is applied to things formed out of the shell of the turtle or the land tortoise from the greatly superior price of the raw material this principle of copying is however more rarely employed upon it; and the few carvings which are demanded are usually performed by hand  tobaccopipe making this simple art is almost entirely one of copying the moulds are formed of iron in two parts each embracing one half of the stem; the line of junction of these parts may generally be observed running lengthwise from one end of the pipe to the other the hole passing to the bowl is formed by thrusting a long wire through the clay before it is enclosed in the mould some of the moulds have figures or names sunk in the inside which give a corresponding figure in relief upon the finished pipe  embossing upon calico calicoes of one colour but embossed all over with raised patterns though not much worn in this country are in great demand in several foreign markets this appearance is produced by passing them between rollers on one of which is figured in intaglio the pattern to be transferred to the calico the substance of the cloth is pressed very forcibly into the cavities thus formed and retains its pattern after considerable use the watered appearance in the cover of the volume in the reader's hands is produced in a similar manner a cylinder of gunmetal on which the design of the watering is previously cut is pressed by screws against another cylinder formed out of pieces of brown paper which have been strongly compressed together and accurately turned the two cylinders are made to revolve rapidly the paper one being slightly damped and after a few minutes it takes an impression from the upper or metal one the glazed calico is now passed between the rollers its glossy surface being in contact with the metal cylinder which is kept hot by a heated iron enclosed within it calicoes are sometimes watered by placing two pieces on each other in such a position that the longitudinal threads of the one are at right angles to those of the other and compressing them in this state between flat rollers the threads of the one piece produce indentations in those of the other but they are not so deep as when produced by the former method  embossing upon leather this art of copying from patterns previously engraved on steel rollers is in most respects similar to the preceding the leather is forced into the cavities and the parts which are not opposite to any cavity are powerfully condensed between the rollers  swaging this is an art of copying practised by the smith in order to fashion his iron and steel into the various forms demanded by his customers he has small blocks of steel into which are sunk cavities of different shapes; these are called swages and are generally in pairs thus if he wants a round bolt terminating in a cylindrical head of larger diameter and having one or more projecting rims he uses a corresponding swaging tool; and having heated the end of his iron rod and thickened it by striking the end in the direction of the axis which is technically called upsetting he places its head upon one part of the lage; and whilst an assistant holds the other part on the top of the hot iron he strikes it several times with his hammer occasionally turning the head one quarter round the heated iron is thus forced by the blows to assume the form of the mould into which it is impressed  engraving by pressure this is one of the most beautiful examples of the art of copying carried to an almost unlimited extent; and the delicacy with which it can be executed and the precision with which the finest traces of the graving tool can be transferred from steel to copper or even from hard steel to soft steel is most unexpected we are indebted to mr perkins for most of the contrivances which have brought this art at once almost to perfection an engraving is first made upon soft steel which is hardened by a peculiar process without in the least injuring its delicacy a cylinder of soft steel pressed with great force against the hardened steel engraving is now made to roll very slowly backward and forward over it thus receiving the design but in relief the cylinder is in its turn hardened without injury and if it be slowly rolled to and fro with strong pressure on successive plates of copper it will imprint on a thousand of them a perfect facsimile of the original steel engraving from which it was made thus the number of copies producible from the same design may be multiplied a thousandfold but even this is very far short of the limits to which the process may be extended the hardened steel roller bearing the design upon it in relief may be employed to make a few of its first impressions upon plates of soft steel and these being hardened become the representatives of the original engraving and may in their turn be made the parents of other rollers each generating copperplates like their prototype the possible extent to which facsimiles of one original engraving may thus be multiplied almost confounds the imagination and appears to be for all practical purposes unlimited this beautiful art was first proposed by mr perkins for the purpose of rendering the forgery of bank notes a matter of great difficulty; and there are two principles which peculiarly adapt it to that object first the perfect identity of all the impressions so that any variation in the minutest line would at once cause detection; secondly that the original plates may be formed by the united labours of several artists most eminent in their respective departments; for as only one original of each design is necessary the expense even of the most elaborate engraving will be trifling compared with the multitude of copies produced from it  it must however be admitted that the principle of copying itself furnishes an expedient for imitating any engraving or printed pattern however complicated; and thus presents a difficulty which none of the schemes devised for the prevention of forgery appear to have yet effectually obviated in attempting to imitate the most perfect banknote the first process would be to place it with the printed side downwards upon a stone or other substance on which by passing it through a rollingpress it might be firmly fixed the next object would be to discover some solvent which should dissolve the paper but neither affect the printingink nor injure the stone or substance to which it is attached water does not seem to do this effectually and perhaps weak alkaline or acid solutions would be tried if however this could be fully accomplished and if the stone or other substance used to retain the impression had those properties which enable us to print from it innumerable facsimiles of the note might obviously be made and the imitation would be complete porcelain biscuit which has recently been used with a black lead pencil for memorandum books seems in some measure adapted for such trials since its porosity may be diminished to any required extent by regulating the dilution of the glazing  gold and silver moulding many of the mouldings used by jewellers consist of thin slips of metal which have received their form by passing between steel rollers on which the pattern is embossed or engraved; thus taking a succession of copies of the devices intended  ornamental papers sheets of paper coloured or covered with gold or silver leaf and embossed with various patterns are used for covering books and for many ornamental purposes the figures upon these are produced by the same process that of passing the sheets of paper between engraved rollers  of copying by stamping  this mode of copying is extensively employed in the arts it is generally executed by means of large presses worked with a screw and heavy flywheel the materials on which the copies are impressed are most frequently metals and the process is sometimes executed when they are hot and in one case when the metal is in a state between solidity and fluidity  coins and medals the whole of the coins which circulate as money are produced by this mode of copying the screw presses are either worked by manual labour by water or by steam power the mint which was sent a few years since to calcutta was capable of coining pieces a day medals which usually have their figures in higher relief than coins are produced by similar means; but a single blow is rarely sufficient to bring them to perfection and the compression of the metal which arises from the first blow renders it too hard to receive many subsequent blows without injury to the die it is therefore after being struck removed to a furnace in which it is carefully heated redhot and annealed after which operation it is again placed between the dies and receives additional blows for medals on which the figures are very prominent these processes must be repeated many times one of the largest medals hitherto struck underwent them nearly a hundred times before it was completed  ornaments for military accoutrements and furniture these are usually of brass and are stamped up out of solid or sheet brass by placing it between dies and allowing a heavy weight to drop upon the upper die from a height of from five to fifteen feet  buttons and nail heads buttons embossed with crests or other devices are produced by the same means; and some of those which are plain receive their hemispherical form from the dies in which they are struck the heads of several kinds of nails which are portions of spheres or polyhedrons are also formed by these means  of a process for copying called in france clichee this curious method of copying by stamping is applied to medals and in some cases to forming stereotype plates there exists a range of temperature previous to the melting point of several of the alloys of lead tin and antimony in which the compound is neither solid nor yet fluid in this kind of pasty state it is placed in a box under a die which descends upon it with considerable force the blow drives the metal into the finest lines of the die and the coldness of the latter immediately solidifies the whole mass a quantity of the halfmelted metal is scattered in all directions by the blow and is retained by the sides of the box in which the process is carried on the work thus produced is admirable for its sharpness but has not the finished form of a piece just leaving the coiningpress the sides are ragged and it must be trimmed and its thickness equalized in the lathe  of copying by punching  this mode of copying consists in driving a steel punch through the substance to be cut either by a blow or by pressure in some cases the object is to copy the aperture and the substance separated from the plate is rejected; in other cases the small pieces cut out are the objects of the workman's labour  punching iron plate for boilers the steel punch used for this purpose is from threeeighths to threequarters of an inch in diameter and drives out a circular disk from a plate of iron from onequarter to five eighths of an inch thick  punching tinned iron the ornamental patterns of open work which decorate the tinned and japanned wares in general use are rarely punched by the workman who makes them in london the art of punching out these patterns in screwpresses is carried on as a separate trade; and large quantities of sheet tin are thus perforated for cullenders winestrainers borders of waiters and other similar purposes the perfection and the precision to which the art has been carried are remarkable sheets of copper too are punched with small holes about the hundredth of an inch in diameter in such multitudes that more of the sheet metal is removed than remains behind; and plates of tin have been perforated with above three thousand holes in each square inch  the inlaid plates of brass and rosewood called buhl work which ornament our furniture are in some instances formed by punching; but in this case both the parts cut out and those which remain are in many cases employed in the remaining illustrations of the art of copying by punching the part made use of is that which is punched out  cards for guns the substitution of a circular disk of thin card instead of paper for retaining in its place the charge of a fowlingpiece is attended with considerable advantage it would however be of little avail unless an easy method was contrived of producing an unlimited number of cards each exactly fitting the bore of the barrel the small steel tool used for this purpose cuts out innumerable circles similar to its cutting end each of which precisely fills the barrel for which it was designed  ornaments of gilt paper the golden stars leaves and other devices sold in shops for the purpose of ornamenting articles made of paper and pasteboard and other fancy works are cut by punches of various forms out of sheets of gilt paper  steel chains the chain used in connecting the mainspring and fusee in watches and clocks is composed of small pieces of sheet steel and it is of great importance that each of these pieces should be of exactly the same size the links are of two sorts; one of them consisting of a single oblong piece of steel with two holes in it and the other formed by connecting two of the same pieces of steel placed parallel to each other and at a small distance apart by two rivets the two kinds of links occur alternately in the chain each end of the single pieces being placed between the ends of two others and connected with them by a rivet passing through all three if the rivet holes in the pieces for the double links are not precisely at equal distances the chain will not be straight and will consequently be unfit for its purpose  copying with elongation  in this species of copying there exists but little resemblance between the copy and the original it is the crosssection only of the thing produced which is similar to the tool through which it passes when the substances to be operated upon are hard they must frequently pass in succession through several holes and it is in some cases necessary to anneal them at intervals  wire drawing the metal to be converted into wire is made of a cylindrical form and drawn forcibly through circular holes in plates of steel at each passage it becomes smaller and when finished its section at any point is a precise copy of the last hole through which it passed upon the larger kinds of wire fine lines may sometimes be traced running longitudinally these arise from slight imperfections in the holes of the drawplates for many purposes of the arts wire the section of which is square or half round is required the same method of making it is pursued except that the holes through which it is drawn are in such cases themselves square or halfround or of whatever other form the wire is required to be a species of wire is made the section of which resembles a star with from six to twelve rays; this is called pinion wire and is used by the clockmakers they file away all the rays from a short piece except from about half an inch near one end this becomes a pinion for a clock; and the leaves or teeth are already burnished and finished from having passed through the drawplate  tube drawing the art of forming tubes of uniform diameter is nearly similar in its mode of execution to wire drawing the sheet brass is bent round and soldered so as to form a hollow cylinder; and if the diameter outside is that which is required to be uniform it is drawn through a succession of holes as in wire drawing if the inside diameter is to be uniform a succession of steel cylinders called triblets are drawn through the brass tube in making tubes for telescopes it is necessary that both the inside and outside should be uniform a steel triblet therefore is first passed into the tube which is then drawn through a succession of holes until the outside diameter is reduced to the required size the metal of which the tube is formed is condensed between these holes and the steel cylinder within; and when the latter is withdrawn the internal surface appears polished the brass tube is considerably extended by this process sometimes even to double its first length  leaden pipes leaden pipes for the conveyance of water were formerly made by casting; but it has been found that they can be made both cheaper and better by drawing them through holes in the manner last described a cylinder of lead of five or six inches in diameter and about two feet long is cast with a small hole through its axis and an iron triblet of about fifteen feet in length is forced into the hole it is then drawn through a series of holes until the lead is extended upon the triblet from one end to the other and is of the proper thickness in proportion to the size of the pipe  iron rolling when cylinders of iron of greater thickness than wire are required they are formed by passing wrought iron between rollers each of which has sunk in it a semicylindrical groove; and as such rollers rarely touch accurately a longitudinal line will usually be observed in the cylinders so manufactured bar iron is thus shaped into all the various forms of round square halfround oval etc in which it occurs in commerce a particular species of moulding is thus made which resembles in its section that part of the frame of a window which separates two adjacent panes of glass being much stronger than wood it can be considerably reduced in thickness and consequently offers less obstruction to the light; it is much used for skylights  it is sometimes required that the iron thus produced should not be of uniform thickness throughout this is the case in bars for railroads where greater depth is required towards the middle of the rail which is at the greatest distance from the supports this form is produced by cutting the groove in the rollers deeper at those parts where additional strength is required so that the hollow which surrounds the roller would if it could be unwound be a mould of the shape the iron is intended to fit  vermicelli the various forms into which this paste is made are given by forcing it through holes in tin plate it passes through them and appears on the other side in long strings the cook makes use of the same method in preparing butter and ornamental pastry for the table and the confectioner in forming cylindrical lozenges of various composition  of copying with altered dimensions  of the pentagraph this mode of copying is chiefly used for drawings or maps the instrument is simple; and although usually employed in reducing is capable of enlarging the size of the copy an automaton figure exhibited in london a short time since which drew profiles of its visitors was regulated by a mechanism on this principle a small aperture in the wall opposite the seat in which the person is placed whose profile is taken conceals a camera lucida which is placed in an adjoining apartment and an assistant by moving a point connected by a pentagraph with the hand of the automaton over the outline of the head causes the figure to trace a corresponding profile  by turning the art of turning might perhaps itself be classed amongst the arts of copying a steel axis called a mandril having a pulley attached to the middle of it is supported at one end either by a conical point or by a cylindrical collar and at the other end by another collar through which it passes the extremity which projects beyond this last collar is formed into a screw by which various instruments called chucks can be attached to it these chucks are intended to hold the various materials to be submitted to the operation of turning and have a great variety of forms the mandril with the chuck is made to revolve by a strap which passes over the pulley that is attached to it and likewise over a larger wheel moved either by the foot or by its connection with steam or water power all work which is executed on a mandril partakes in some measure of the irregularities in the form of that mandril; and the perfect circularity of section which ought to exist in every part of the work can only be ensured by an equal accuracy in the mandril and its collar  rose engine turning this elegant art depends in a great measure on copying circular plates of metal called rosettes having various indentations on the surfaces and edges are fixed on the mandril which admits of a movement either endwise or laterally a fixed obstacle called the 'touch' against which the rosettes are pressed by a spring obliges the mandril to follow their indentations and thus causes the cutting tool to trace out the same pattern on the work the distance of the cutting tool from the centre being usually less than the radius of the rosette causes the copy to be much diminished  copying dies a lathe has been long known in france and recently been used at the english mint for copying dies a blunt point is carried by a very slow spiral movement successively over every part of the die to be copied and is pressed by a weight into all the cavities; while a cutting point connected with it by the machine traverses the face of a piece of soft steel in which it cuts the device of the original die on the same or on a diminished scale the degree of excellence of the copy increases in proportion as it is smaller than the original the die of a crownpiece will furnish by copy a very tolerable die for a sixpence but the chief use to be expected from this lathe is to prepare all the coarser parts and leave only the finer and more expressive lines for the skill and genius of the artist  shoelast making engine an instrument not very unlike in principle was proposed for the purpose of making shoe lasts a pattern last of a shoe for the right foot was placed in one part of the apparatus and when the machine was moved two pieces of wood placed in another part which had been previously adjusted by screws were cut into lasts greater or less than the original as was desired; and although the pattern was for the right foot one of the lasts was for the left an effect which was produced by merely interposing a wheel which reversed the motion between the two pieces of wood to be cut into lasts  engine for copying busts many years since the late mr watt amused himself with constructing an engine to produce copies of busts or statues either of the same size as the original or in a diminished proportion the substances on which he operated were various and some of the results were shewn to his friends but the mechanism by which they were made has never been described more recently mr hawkins who nearly at the same time had also contrived a similar machine has placed it in the hands of an artist who has made copies in ivory from a variety of busts the art of multiplying in different sizes the figures of the sculptor aided by that of rendering their acquisition cheap through the art of casting promises to give additional value to his productions and to diffuse more widely the pleasure arising from their possession  screw cutting when this operation is performed in the lathe by means of a screw upon the mandril it is essentially an art of copying but it is only the number of threads in a given length which is copied; the form of the thread and length as well as the diameter of the screw to be cut are entirely independent of those from which the copy is made there is another method of cutting screws in a lathe by means of one pattern screw which being connected by wheels with the mandril guides the cutting point in this process unless the time of revolution of the mandril is the same as that of the screw which guides the cutting point the number of threads in a given length will be different if the mandril move quicker than the cutting point the screw which is produced will be finer than the original; if it move slower the copy will be more coarse than the original the screw thus generated may be finer or coarser it may be larger or smaller in diameterit may have the same or a greater number of threads than that from which it is copied; yet all the defects which exist in the original will be accurately transmitted under the modified circumstances to every individual generated from it  printing from copper plates with altered dimensions some very singular specimens of an art of copying not yet made public were brought from paris a few years since a watchmaker in that city of the name of gonord had contrived a method by which he could take from the same copperplate impressions of different sizes either larger or smaller than the original design having procured four impressions of a parrot surrounded by a circle executed in this manner i shewed them to the late mr lowry an engraver equally distinguished for his skill and for the many mechanical contrivances with which he enriched his art the relative dimensions of the several impressions were so that the largest was nearly three times the linear size of the smallest; and mr lowry assured me that he was unable to detect any lines in one which had not corresponding lines in the others there appeared to be a difference in the quantity of ink but none in the traces of the engraving; and from the general appearance it was conjectured that the largest but one was the original impression from the copperplate the means by which this singular operation was executed have not been published; but two conjectures were formed at the time which merit notice it was supposed that the artist was in possession of some method of transferring the ink from the lines of a copperplate to the surface of some fluid and of retransferring the impression from the fluid to paper if this could be accomplished the print would in the first instance be of exactly the same size as the copper from which it was derived; but if the fluid were contained in a vessel having the form of an inverted cone with a small aperture at the bottom the liquid might be lowered or raised in the vessel by gradual abstraction or addition through the apex of the cone; in this case the surface to which the printingink adhered would diminish or enlarge and in this altered state the impression might be retransferred to paper it must be admitted that this conjectural explanation is liable to very considerable difficulties; for although the converse operation of taking an impression from a liquid surface has a parallel in the art of marbling paper the possibility of transferring the ink from the copper to the fluid requires to be proved another and more plausible explanation is founded on the elastic nature of the compound of glue and treacle a substance already in use in transferring engravings to earthenware it is conjectured that an impression from the copperplate is taken upon a large sheet of this composition; that this sheet is then stretched in both directions and that the ink thus expanded is transferred to paper if the copy is required to be smaller than the original the elastic substance must first be stretched and then receive the impression from the copperplate on removing the tension it will contract and thus reduce the size of the design it is possible that one transfer may not in all cases suffice; as the extensibility of the composition of glue and treacle although considerable is still limited perhaps sheets of india rubber of uniform texture and thickness may be found to answer better than this composition; or possibly the ink might be transferred from the copper plate to the surface of a bottle of this gum which bottle might after being expanded by forcing air into it give up the enlarged impression to paper as it would require considerable time to produce impressions in this manner and there might arise some difficulty in making them all of precisely the same size the process might be rendered more certain and expeditious by performing that part of the operation which depends on the enlargement or diminution of the design only once; and instead of printing from the soft substance transferring the design from it to stone thus a considerable portion of the work would be reduced to an art already well known that of lithography this idea receives some confirmation from the fact that in another set of specimens consisting of a map of st petersburgh of several sizes a very short line evidently an accidental defect occurs in all the impressions of one particular size but not in any of a different size  machine to produce engraving from medals an instrument was contrived a long time ago and is described in the manuel de tourneur by which copperplate engravings are produced from medals and other objects in relief the medal and the copper are fixed on two sliding plates at right angles to each other so connected that when the plate on which the medal is fixed is raised vertically by a screw the slide holding the copperplate is advanced by an equal quantity in the horizontal direction the medal is fixed on the vertical slide with its face towards the copperplate and a little above it a bar terminating at one end in a tracing point and at the other in a short arm at right angles to the bar and holding a diamond point is placed horizontally above the copper; so that the tracing point shall touch the medal to which the bar is perpendicular and the diamond point shall touch the copperplate to which the arm is perpendicular under this arrangement the bar being supposed to move parallel to itself and consequently to the copper if the tracing point pass over a flat part of the medal the diamond point will draw a straight line of equal length upon the copper; but if the tracing point pass over any projecting part of the medal the deviation from the straight line by the diamond point will be exactly equal to the elevation of the corresponding point of the medal above the rest of the surface thus by the transit of this tracing point over any line upon the medal the diamond will draw upon the copper a section of the medal through that line a screw is attached to the apparatus so that if the medal be raised a very small quantity by the screw the copperplate will be advanced by the same quantity and thus a new line of section may be drawn and by continuing this process the series of sectional lines on the copper produces the representation of the medal on a plane the outline and the form of the figure arising from the sinuosities of the lines and from their greater or less proximity the effect of this kind of engraving is very striking; and in some specimens gives a high degree of apparent relief it has been practised on plate glass and is then additionally curious from the circumstance of the fine lines traced by the diamond being invisible except in certain lights from this description it will have been seen that the engraving on copper must be distorted; that is to say that the projection on the copper cannot be the same as that which arises from a perpendicular projection of each point of the medal upon a plane parallel to itself the position of the prominent parts will be more altered than that of the less elevated; and the greater the relief of the medal the more distorted will be its engraved representation mr john bate son of mr bate of the poultry has contrived an improved machine for which he has taken a patent in which this source of distortion is remedied the head in the title page of the present volume is copied from a medal of roger bacon which forms one of a series of medals of eminent men struck at the royal mint at munich and is the first of the published productions of this new art* the inconvenience which arises from too high a relief in the medal or in the bust might be remedied by some mechanical contrivance by which the deviation of the diamond point from the right line which it would describe when the tracing point traverses a plane would be made proportional not to the elevation of the corresponding point above the plane of the medal but to its elevation above some other parallel plane removed to a fit distance behind it thus busts and statues might be reduced to any required degree of relief  the machine just described naturally suggests other views which seem to deserve some consideration and perhaps some experiment if a medal were placed under the tracing point of a pentagraph an engraving tool substituted for the pencil and a copperplate in the place of the paper; and if by some mechanism the tracing point which slides in a vertical plane could as it is carried over the different elevations of the medal increase or diminish the depth of the engraved line proportionally to the actual height of the corresponding point on the medal then an engraving would be produced free at least from any distortion although it might be liable to objections of a different kind if by any similar contrivance instead of lines we could make on each point of the copper a dot varying in size or depth with the altitude of the corresponding point of the medal above its plane than a new species of engraving would be produced and the variety of these might again be increased by causing the graving point to describe very small circles of diameters varying with the height of the point on the medal above a given plane; or by making the graving tool consist of three equidistant points whose distance increased or diminished according to some determinate law dependent on the elevation of the point represented above the plane of the medal it would perhaps be difficult to imagine the effects of some of these kinds of engraving; but they would all possess in common the property of being projections by parallel lines of the objects represented and the intensity of the shade of the ink would either vary according to some function of the distance of the point represented from some given plane or it would be a little modified by the distances from the same plane of a few of the immediately contiguous points  the system of shading maps by means of lines of equal altitude above the sea bears some analogy to this mode of representing medals and if applied to them would produce a different species of engraved resemblance the projections on the plane of the medal of the section of an imaginary plane placed at successive distances above it with the medal itself would produce a likeness of the figure on the medal in which all the inclined parts of it would be dark in proportion to their inclination other species of engraving might be conceived by substituting instead of the imaginary plane an imaginary sphere or other solid intersecting the figure in the medal  lace made by caterpillars a most extraordinary species of manufacture which is in a slight degree connected with copying has been contrived by an officer of engineers residing at munich it consists of lace and veils with open patterns in them made entirely by caterpillars the following is the mode of proceeding adopted he makes a paste of the leaves of the plant which is the usual food of the species of caterpillar* he employs and spreads it thinly over a stone or other flat substance he then with a camelhair pencil dipped in olive oil draws upon the coating of paste the pattern he wishes the insects to leave open this stone is then placed in an inclined position and a number of the caterpillars are placed at the bottom a peculiar species is chosen which spins a strong web; and the animals commencing at the bottom eat and spin their way up to the top carefully avoiding every part touched by the oil but devouring all the rest of the paste the extreme lightness of these veils combined with some strength is truly surprising one of them measuring twentysix and a half inches by seventeen inches weighed only grains; a degree of lightness which will appear more strongly by contrast with other fabrics one square yard of the substance of which these veils are made weighs  grains whilst one square yard of silk gauze weighs grains and one square yard of the finest patent net weighs  grains the ladies' coloured muslin dresses mentioned in the table subjoined cost ten shillings per dress and each weigh six ounces; the cotton from which they are made weighing nearly six and twoninth ounces avoirdupois weight weight of one square yard of each of the following articles*          weight of       weight cotton used     value  finished of

copying is the foundation may be terminated with an example which has long been under the eye of the reader; although few perhaps are aware of the number of repeated copyings of which these very pages are the subject  they are copies by printing from stereotype plates  these stereotype plates are copied by the art of casting from moulds formed of plaster of paris  these moulds are themselves copied by casting the plaster in a liquid state upon the moveable types set up by the compositor it is here that the union of the intellectual and the mechanical departments takes place the mysteries however of an author's copying form no part of our enquiry although it may be fairly remarked that in numerous instances the mental far eclipses the mechanical copyist  these moveable types the obedient messengers of the most opposite thoughts the most conflicting theories are themselves copies by casting from moulds of copper called matrices  the lower part of those matrices bearing the impressions of the letters or characters are copies by punching from steel punches on which the same characters exist in relief  these steel punches are not themselves entirely exempted from the great principle of art many of the cavities which exist in them such as those in the middle of the punches for the letters a b d e g etc are produced from other steel punches in which these parts are in relief we have thus traced through six successive stages of copying the mechanical art of printing from stereotype plates the principle of copying contributing in this as in every other department of manufacture to the uniformity and the cheapness of the work produced notes  the late mr lowry  i posses a lithographic reprint of a page of a table which appears from the from of the type to have been several years old  the construction of the engraving becomes evident on examining it with a lens of sufficient power to show the continuity of the lines  the phalaena pardilla which feeds on the prunus padus  some of these weights and measures are calculated from a statement in the report of the committee of the house of commons on printed cotton goods; and the widths of the pieces there given are presumed to be the real widths not those by which they are called in the retail shops  chapter  on the method of observing manufactories  having now reviewed the mechanical principles which regulate the successful application of mechanical science to great establishments for the production of manufactured goods it remains for us to suggest a few enquiries and to offer a few observations to those whom an enlightened curiosity may lead to examine the factories of this or of other countries the remarkthat it is important to commit to writing all information as soon as possible after it is received especially when numbers are concernedapplies to almost all enquiries it is frequently impossible to do this at the time of visiting an establishment although not the slightest jealousy may exist; the mere act of writing information as it is communicated orally is a great interruption to the examination of machinery in such cases therefore it is advisable to have prepared beforehand the questions to be asked and to leave blanks for the answers which may be quickly inserted as in a multitude of cases they are merely numbers those who have not tried this plan will be surprised at the quantity of information which may through its means be acquired even by a short examination each manufacture requires its own list of questions which will be better drawn up after the first visit the following outline which is very generally applicable may suffice for an illustration; and to save time it may be convenient to have it printed; and to bind up in the form of a pocketbook a hundred copies of the skeleton forms for processes with about twenty of the general enquiries  general enquiries  outlines of a description of any of the mechanical arts ought to contain information on the following points brief sketch of its history particularly the date of its invention and of its introduction into england short reference to the previous states through which the material employed has passed the places whence it is procured the price of a given quantity the various processes must now be described successively according to the plan which will be given in ; after which the following information should be given are various kinds of the same article made in one establishment or at different ones and are there differences in the processes? to what defects are the goods liable? what substitutes or adulterations are used? what waste is allowed by the master? what tests are there of the goodness of the manufactured articles? the weight of a given quantity or number and a comparison with that of the raw material? the wholesale price at the manufactory? l s d per the usual retail price? l s d who provide tools? master or men? who repair tools? master or men? what is the expense of the machinery? what is the annual wear and tear and what its duration? is there any particular trade for making it? where? is it made and repaired at the manufactory? in any manufactory visited state the number  of processes; and of the persons employed in each process; and the quantity of manufactured produce what quantity is made annually in great britain? is the capital invested in manufactories large or small? mention the principal seats of this manufacture in england; and if it flourishes abroad the places where it is established the duty excise or bounty if any should be stated and any alterations in past years; and also the amount exported or imported for a series of years whether the same article but of superior equal or inferior make is imported? does the manufacturer export or sell to a middleman who supplies the merchant? to what countries is it chiefly sent? and in what goods are the returns made?  each process requires a separate skeleton and the following outline will be sufficient for many different manufactories  process  manufacture  place  name  date  the mode of executing it with sketches of the tools or machine if necessary the number of persons necessary to attend the machine are the operatives men  women  or children?  if mixed what are the proportions? what is the pay of each? s d s d s d per  what number  of hours do they work per day? is it usual or necessary to work night and day without stopping? is the labour performed by pieceor by daywork? who provide tools? master or men? who repair tools? master or men? what degree of skill is required and how many years'  apprenticeship? the number of times  the operation is repeated per day or per hour? the number of failures  in a thousand? whether the workmen or the master loses by the broken or damaged articles? what is done with them? if the same process is repeated several times state the diminution or increase of measure and the loss if any at each repetition  in this skeleton the answers to the questions are in some cases printed as who repair the tools?masters men; in order that the proper answer may be underlined with a pencil in filling up the answers which require numbers some care should be taken for instance if the observer stands with his watch in his hand before a person heading a pin the workman will almost certainly increase his speed and the estimate will be too large a much better average will result from enquiring what quantity is considered a fair day's work when this cannot be ascertained the number of operations performed in a given time may frequently be counted when the workman is quite unconscious that any person is observing him thus the sound made by the motion of a loom may enable the observer to count the number of strokes per minute even though he is outside the building in which it is contained m coulomb who had great experience in making such observations cautions those who may repeat his experiments against being deceived by such circumstances 'je prie' says he 'ceux qui voudront les repeter s'ils n'ont pas le temps de mesurer les resultats apres plusiers jours d'un travail continu d'observer les ouvriers a differentes reprises dans la journee sans qu'ils sachent qu'ils sont observes l'on ne peut trop avertir combien l'on risque de se tromper en calculant soit la vitesse soit le temps effectif du travail d'apres une observation de quelques minutes' memoires de l'institut vol ii p it frequently happens that in a series of answers to such questions there are some which although given directly may also be deduced by a short calculation from others that are given or known; and advantage should always be taken of these verifications in order to confirm the accuracy of the statements; or in case they are discordant to correct the apparent anomalies in putting lists of questions into the hands of a person undertaking to give information upon any subject it is in some cases desirable to have an estimate of the soundness of his judgement the questions can frequently be so shaped that some of them may indirectly depend on others; and one or two may be inserted whose answers can be obtained by other methods nor is this process without its advantages in enabling us to determine the value of our own judgement the habit of forming an estimate of the magnitude of any object or the frequency of any occurrence immediately previous to our applying to it measure or number tends materially to fix the attention and to improve the judgement section ii on the domestic and political economy of manufactures  chapter  distinction between making and manufacturing  the economical principles which regulate the application of machinery and which govern the interior of all our great factories are quite as essential to the prosperity of a great commercial country as are those mechanical principles the operation of which has been illustrated in the preceding section the first object of every person who attempts to make any article of consumption is or ought to be to produce it in a perfect form; but in order to secure to himself the greatest and most permanent profit he must endeavour by every means in his power to render the new luxury or want which he has created cheap to those who consume it the larger number of purchasers thus obtained will in some measure secure him from the caprices of fashion whilst it furnishes a far greater amount of profit although the contribution of each individual is diminished the importance of collecting data for the purpose of enabling the manufacturer to ascertain how many additional customers he will acquire by a given reduction in the price of the article he makes cannot be too strongly pressed upon the attention of those who employ themselves in statistical enquiries in some ranks of society no diminution of price can bring forward a great additional number of customers; whilst amongst other classes a very small reduction will so enlarge the sale as to yield a considerable increase of profit materials calculated to assist in forming a table of the numbers of persons who possess incomes of different amount occur in the th report of the commissioners of revenue inquiry which includes a statement of the amount of personal property proved at the legacy office during one year; the number of the various classes of testators; and an account of the number of persons receiving dividends from funded property distributed into classes such a table formed even approximately and exhibited in the form of a curve might be of service  a considerable difference exists between the terms making and manufacturing the former refers to the production of a small the latter to that of a very large number of individuals; and the difference is well illustrated in the evidence given before the committee of the house of commons on the export of tools and machinery on that occasion mr maudslay stated that he had been applied to by the navy board to make iron tanks for ships and that he was rather unwilling to do so as he considered it to be out of his line of business; however he undertook to make one as a trial the holes for the rivets were punched by handpunching with presses and the holes which each tank required cost seven shillings the navy board who required a large number proposed that he should supply forty tanks a week for many months the magnitude of the order made it worth his while to commence manufacture and to make tools for the express business mr maudslay therefore offered if the board would give him an order for two thousand tanks to supply them at the rate of eighty per week the order was given he made tools by which the expense of punching the rivetholes of each tank was reduced from seven shillings to ninepence; he supplied ninetyeight tanks a week for six months and the price charged for each was reduced from seventeen pounds to fifteen  if therefore the maker of an article wish to become a manufacturer in the more extended sense of the term he must attend to other principles besides those mechanical ones on which the successful execution of his work depends; and he must carefully arrange the whole system of his factory in such a manner that the article he sells to the public may be produced at as small a cost as possible should he not be actuated at first by motives so remote he will in every highly civilized country be compelled by the powerful stimulus of competition to attend to the principles of the domestic economy of manufactures at every reduction in price of the commodity he makes he will be driven to seek compensation in a saving of expense in some of the processes; and his ingenuity will be sharpened in this enquiry by the hope of being able in his turn to undersell his rivals the benefit of the improvements thus engendered is for a short time confined to those from whose ingenuity they derive their origin; but when a sufficient experience has proved their value they become generally adopted until in their turn they are superseded by other more economical methods  chapter  of money as a medium of exchange  in the earlier stages of societies the interchange of the few commodities required was conducted by barter but as soon as their wants became more varied and extensive the necessity of having some common measure of the value of all commodities itself capable of subdivisionbecame apparent thus money was introduced in some countries shells have been employed for this purpose; but civilized nations have by common consent adopted the precious metals* the sovereign power has in most countries assumed the right of coining; or in other words the right of stamping with distinguishing marks pieces of metal having certain forms and weights and a certain degree of fineness the marks becoming a guarantee to the people amongst whom the money circulates that each piece is of the required weight and quality the expense of manufacturing gold into coin and that of the loss arising from wear as well as of interest on the capital invested in it must either be defrayed by the state or be compensated by a small reduction in its weight and is a far less cost to the nation than the loss of time and inconvenience which would arise from a system of exchange or barter  these coins are liable to two inconveniences they may be manufactured privately by individuals of the same quality and similarly stamped; or imitations may be made of inferior metal or of diminished weight the first of these inconveniences would be easily remedied by making the current value of the coin nearly equal to that of the same weight of the metal; and the second would be obviated by the caution of individuals in examining the external characters of each coin and partly by the punishment inflicted by the state on the perpetrators of such frauds  the subdivisions of money vary in different countries and much time may be lost by an inconvenient system of division the effect is felt in keeping extensive accounts and particularly in calculating the interest on loans or the discount upon bills of exchange the decimal system is the best adapted to facilitate all such calculations; and it becomes an interesting question to consider whether our own currency might not be converted into one decimally divided the great step that of abolishing the guinea has already been taken without any inconvenience and but little is now required to render the change complete  if whenever it becomes necessary to call in the halfcrowns a new coin of the value of two shillings were issued which should be called by some name implying a unit a prince for instance we should have the tenth part of a sovereign a few years after when the public were familiar with this coin it might be divided into one hundred instead of ninetysix farthings; and it would then consist of twentyfive pence each of which would be four per cent less in value than the former penny the shillings and sixpences being then withdrawn from circulation their place might be supplied with silver coins each worth five of the new pence and by others of tenpence and of twopence halfpenny; the latter coin having a distinct name would be the tenth part of a prince  the various manufactured commodities and the various property possessed by the inhabitants of a country all become measured by the standard thus introduced but it must be observed that the value of gold is itself variable; and that like all other commodities its price depends on the extent of the demand compared with that of the supply  as transactions multiply and the sums to be paid become large the actual transfer of the precious metals from one individual to another is attended with inconvenience and difficulty and it is found more convenient to substitute written promises to pay on demand specified quantities of gold these promises are called banknotes; and when the person or body issuing them is known to be able to fulfil the pledge the note will circulate for a long time before it gets into the hands of any person who may wish to make use of the gold it represents these paper representatives supply the place of a certain quantity of gold; and being much cheaper a large portion of the expense of a metallic circulation is saved by their employment  as commercial transactions increase the transfer of banknotes is to a considerable extent superseded by shorter processes banks are established into which all monies are paid and out of which all payments are made through written orders called checks drawn by those who keep accounts with them in a large capital each bank receives through its numerous customers checks payable by every other; and if clerks were sent round to receive the amount in banknotes due from each it would occupy much time and be attended with some risk and inconvenience  clearing house in london this is avoided by making all checks paid in to bankers pass through what is technically called the clearing house in a large room in lombard street about thirty clerks from the several london bankers take their stations in alphabetical order at desks placed round the room; each having a small open box by his side and the name of the firm to which he belongs in large characters on the wall above his head from time to time other clerks from every house enter the room and passing along drop into the box the checks due by that firm to the house from which this distributor is sent the clerk at the table enters the amount of the several checks in a book previously prepared under the name of the bank to which they are respectively due four o'clock in the afternoon is the latest hour to which the boxes are open to receive checks; and at a few minutes before that time some signs of increased activity begin to appear in this previously quiet and businesslike scene numerous clerks then arrive anxious to distribute up to the latest possible moment the checks which have been paid into the houses of their employers at four o'clock all the boxes are removed and each clerk adds up the amount of the checks put into his box and payable by his own to other houses he also receives another book from his own house containing the amounts of the checks which their distributing clerk has put into the box of every other banker having compared these he writes out the balances due to or from his own house opposite the name of each of the other banks; and having verified this statement by a comparison with the similar list made by the clerks of those houses he sends to his own bank the general balance resulting from this sheet the amount of which if it is due from that to other houses is sent back in banknotes at five o'clock the inspector takes his seat; when each clerk who has upon the result of all the transactions a balance to pay to various other houses pays it to the inspector who gives a ticket for the amount the clerks of those houses to whom money is due then receive the several sums from the inspector who takes from them a ticket for the amount thus the whole of these payments are made by a double system of balance a very small amount of banknotes passing from hand to hand and scarcely any coin  it is difficult to form a satisfactory estimate of the sums which daily pass through this operation they fluctuate from two millions to perhaps fifteen about two millions and a half may possibly be considered as something like an average requiring for its adjustment perhaps l in bank notes and l in specie by an agreement between the different bankers all checks which have the name of any firm written across them must pass through the clearing house consequently if any such check should be lost the firm on which it is drawn would refuse to pay it at the counter; a circumstance which adds greatly to the convenience of commerce the advantage of this system is such that two meetings a day have been recently establishedone at twelve the other at three o'clock; but the payment of balances takes place once only at five o'clock if all the private banks kept accounts with the bank of england it would be possible to carry on the whole of these transactions with a still smaller quantity of circulating medium  in reflecting on the facility with which these vast transactions are accomplishedsupposing for the sake of argument that they form only the fourth part of the daily transactions of the whole communityit is impossible not to be struck with the importance of interfering as little as possible with their natural adjustment each payment indicates a transfer of property made for the benefit of both parties; and if it were possible which it is not to place by legal or other means some impediment in the way which only amounted to oneeighth per cent such a species of friction would produce a useless expenditure of nearly four millions annually a circumstance which is deserving the attention of those who doubt the good policy of the expense incurred by using the precious metals for one portion of the currency of the country  one of the most obvious differences between a metallic and a paper circulation is that the coin can never by any panic or national danger be reduced below the value of bullion in other civilized countries; whilst a paper currency may from the action of such causes totally lose its value both metallic and paper money it is true may be depreciated but with very different effects  depreciation of coin the state may issue coin of the same nominal value but containing only half the original quantity of gold mixed with some cheap alloy; but every piece so issued bears about with it internal evidence of the amount of the depreciation it is not necessary that every successive proprietor should analyse the new coin; but a few having done so its intrinsic worth becomes publicly known of course the coin previously in circulation is now more valuable as bullion and quickly disappears all future purchases adjust themselves to the new standard and prices are quickly doubled; but all past contracts also are vitiated and all persons to whom money is owing if compelled to receive payment in the new coin are robbed of onehalf of their debt which is confiscated for the benefit of the debtor  depreciation of paper the depreciation of paper money follows a different course if by any act of the government paper is ordained to be a legal tender for debts and at the same time ceases to be exchangeable for coin those who have occasion to purchase of foreigners who are not compelled to take the notes will make some of their payments in gold; and if the issue of paper unchecked by the power of demanding the gold it represents be continued the whole of the coin will soon disappear but the public who are obliged to take the notes are unable by any internal evidence to detect the extent of their depreciation; it varies with the amount in circulation and may go on till the notes shall be worth little more than the paper on which they are printed during the whole of this time every creditor is suffering to an extent which he cannot measure; and every bargain is rendered uncertain in its advantage by the continually changing value of the medium through which it is conducted this calamitous course has actually been run in several countries in france it reached nearly its extreme limit during the existence of assignats we have ourselves experienced some portion of the misery it creates; but by a return to sounder principles have happily escaped the destruction and ruin which always attends the completion of that career  every person in a civilized country requires according to his station in life the use of a certain quantity of money to make the ordinary purchases of the articles which he consumes the same individual pieces of coin it is true circulate again and again in the same district the identical piece of silver received by the workman on saturday night passing through the hands of the butcher the baker and the small tradesman is perhaps given by the latter to the manufacturer in exchange for his check and is again paid into the hands of the workman at the end of the succeeding week any deficiency in this supply of money is attended with considerable inconvenience to all parties if it be only in the smaller coins the first effect is a difficulty in procuring small change; then a disposition in the shopkeepers to refuse change unless a purchase to a certain amount be made; and finally a premium in money will be given for changing the larger denominations of coin thus money itself varies in price when measured by other money in larger masses and this effect takes place whether the circulating medium is metallic or of paper these effects have constantly occurred and particularly during the late war; and in order to relieve it silver tokens for various sums were issued by the bank of england the inconvenience and loss arising from a deficiency of small money fall with greatest weight on the classes whose means are least; for the wealthier buyers can readily procure credit for their small purchases until their bill amounts to one of the larger coins  as money when kept in a drawer produces nothing few people in any situation of life will keep either in coin or in notes more than is immediately necessary for their use; when therefore there are no profitable modes of employing money a superabundance of paper will return to the source from whence it issued and an excess of coin will be converted into bullion and exported  since the worth of all property is measured by money it is obviously conducive to the general welfare of the community that fluctuations in its value should be rendered as small and as gradual as possible the evils which result from sudden changes in the value of money will perhaps become more sensible if we trace their effects in particular instances assuming as we are quite at liberty to do an extreme case let us suppose three persons each possessing a hundred pounds one of these a widow advanced in years and who by the advice of her friends purchases with that sum an annuity of twenty pounds a year during her life and let the two others be workmen who by industry and economy have each saved a hundred pounds out of their wages; both these latter persons proposing to procure machines for calendering and to commence that business one of these invests his money in a savings' bank; intending to make his own calendering machine and calculating that he shall expend twenty pounds in materials and the remaining eighty in supporting himself and in paying the workmen who assist him in constructing it the other workman meeting with a machine which he can buy for two hundred pounds agrees to pay for it a hundred pounds immediately and the remainder at the end of a twelvemonth let us now imagine some alteration to take place in the currency by which it is depreciated onehalf prices soon adjust themselves to the new circumstances and the annuity of the widow though nominally of the same amount will in reality purchase only half the quantity of the necessaries of life which it did before the workman who had placed his money in the savings' bank having perhaps purchased ten pounds' worth of materials and expended ten pounds in labour applied to them now finds himself by this alteration in the currency possessed nominally of eighty pounds but in reality of a sum which will purchase only half the labour and materials required to finish his machine; and he can neither complete it from want of capital nor dispose of what he has already done in its unfinished state for the price it has cost him in the meantime the other workman who had incurred a debt of a hundred pounds in order to complete the purchase of his calendering machine finds that the payments he receives for calendering have like all other prices doubled in consequence of the depreciation of the currency; and he has therefore in fact obtained his machine for one hundred and fifty pounds thus without any fault or imprudence and owing to circumstances over which they have no control the widow is reduced almost to starve; one workman is obliged to renounce for several years his hope of becoming a master; and another without any superior industry or skill but in fact from having made with reference to his circumstances rather an imprudent bargain finds himself unexpectedly relieved from half his debt and the possessor of a valuable source of profit; whilst the former owner of the machine if he also has invested the money arising from its sale in the savings' bank finds his property suddenly reduced onehalf  these evils to a greater or less extent attend every change in the value of the currency; and the importance of preserving it as far as possible unaltered in value cannot be too strongly impressed upon all classes of the community notes  in russia platinum has been employed for coin; and it possesses a peculiarity which deserves notice platinum cannot be melted in our furnaces and is chiefly valuable in commerce when in the shape of ingots from which it may be forged into useful forms but when a piece of platinum is cut into two parts it cannot easily be reunited except by means of a chemical process in which both parts are dissolved in an acid hence when platinum coin is too abundant it cannot like gold be reduced into masses by melting but must pass through an expensive process to render it useful  chapter  on the influence of verification on price  the money price of an article at any given period is usually stated to depend upon the proportion between the supply and the demand the average price of the same article during a long period is said to depend ultimately on the power of producing and selling it with the ordinary profits of capital but these principles although true in their general sense are yet so often modified by the influence of others that it becomes necessary to examine a little into the disturbing forces  with respect to the first of these propositions it may be observed that the cost of any article to the purchaser includes besides the ratio of the supply to the demand another element which though often of little importance is in many cases of great consequence the cost to the purchaser is the price he pays for any article added to the cost of verifying the fact of its having that degree of goodness for which he contracts in some cases the goodness of the article is evident on mere inspection and in those cases there is not much difference of price at different shops the goodness of loaf sugar for instance can be discerned almost at a glance; and the consequence is that the price is so uniform and the profit upon it so small that no grocer is at all anxious to sell it; whilst on the other hand tea of which it is exceedingly difficult to judge and which can be adulterated by mixture so as to deceive the skill even of a practised eye has a great variety of different prices and is that article which every grocer is most anxious to sell to his customers the difficulty and expense of verification are in some instances so great as to justify the deviation from wellestablished principles thus it is a general maxim that government can purchase any article at a cheaper rate than that at which they can manufacture it themselves but it has nevertheless been considered more economical to build extensive flourmills such are those at deptford and to grind their own corn than to verify each sack of purchased flour and to employ persons in devising methods of detecting the new modes of adulteration which might be continually resorted to  some years since a mode of preparing old clover and trefoil seeds by a process called doctoring became so prevalent as to excite the attention of the house of commons it appeared in evidence before a committee that the old seed of the white clover was doctored by first wetting it slightly and then drying it with the fumes of burning sulphur and that the red clover seed had its colour improved by shaking it in a sack with a small quantity of indigo; but this being detected after a time the doctors then used a preparation of logwood fined by a little copperas and sometimes by verdigris; thus at once improving the appearance of the old seed and diminishing if not destroying its vegetative power already enfeebled by age supposing no injury had resulted to good seed so prepared it was proved that from the improved appearance the market price would be enhanced by this process from five to twentyfive shillings a hundred weight but the greatest evil arose from the circumstance of these processes rendering old and worthless seed equal in appearance to the best one witness had tried some doctored seed and found that not above one grain in a hundred grew and that those which did vegetate died away afterwards; whilst about eighty or ninety per cent of good seed usually grows the seed so treated was sold to retail dealers in the country who of course endeavoured to purchase at the cheapest rate and from them it got into the hands of the farmers; neither of these classes being capable of distinguishing the fraudulent from the genuine seed many cultivators in consequence diminished their consumption of the article; and others were obliged to pay a higher price to those who had skill to distinguish the mixed seed and who had integrity and character to prevent them from dealing in it  in the irish flax trade a similar example of the high price paid for verification occurs it is stated in the report of the committee that the natural excellent quality of irish flax as contrasted with foreign or british has been admitted yet from the evidence before that committee it appears that irish flax sells in the market from d to d per pound less than other flax of equal or inferior quality part of this difference of price arises from negligence in its preparation but a part also from the expense of ascertaining that each parcel is free from useless matter to add to its weight this appears from the evidence of mr j corry who was during twentyseven years secretary to the irish linenboard the owners of the flax who are almost always people in the lower classes of life believe that they can best advance their own interests by imposing on the buyers flax being sold by weight various expedients are used to increase it; and every expedient is injurious particularly the damping of it; a very common practice which makes the flax afterwards heat the inside of every bundle and the bundles all vary in bulk is often full of pebbles or dirt of various kinds to increase the weight in this state it is purchased and exported to great britain the natural quality of irish flax is admitted to be not inferior to that produced by any foreign country; and yet the flax of every foreign country imported into great britain obtains a preference amongst the purchasers because the foreign flax is brought to the british market in a cleaner and more regular state the extent and value of the sales of foreign flax in great britain can be seen by reference to the public accounts; and i am induced to believe that ireland by an adequate extension of her flax tillage and having her flax markets brought under good regulations could without encroaching in the least degree upon the quantity necessary for her home consumption supply the whole of the demand of the british market to the exclusion of the foreigners  the lace trade affords other examples; and in enquiring into the complaints made to the house of commons by the framework knitters the committee observe that it is singular that the grievance most complained of one hundred and fifty years ago should in the present improved state of the trade be the same grievance which is now most complained of for it appears by the evidence given before your committee that all the witnesses attribute the decay of the trade more to the making of fraudulent and bad articles than to the war or to any other cause and it is shewn by the evidence that a kind of lace called singlepress was manufactured which although good to the eye became nearly spoiled in washing by the slipping of the threads; that not one person in a thousand could distinguish the difference between singlepress and doublepress lace; and that even workmen and manufacturers were obliged to employ a magnifying glass for that purpose; and that in another similar article called warp lace such aid was essential it was also stated by one witness that the trade had not yet ceased excepting in those places where the fraud had been discovered; and from those places no orders are now sent for any sort of nottingham lace the credit being totally ruined  in the stocking trade similar frauds have been practised it appeared in evidence that stockings were made of uniform width from the knee down to the ankle and being wetted and stretched on frames at the calf they retained their shape when dry but that the purchaser could not discover the fraud until after the first washing the stockings hung like bags about his ankles  in the watch trade the practice of deceit in forging the marks and names of respectable makers has been carried to a great extent both by natives and foreigners; and the effect upon our export trade has been most injurious as the following extract from the evidence before a committee of the house of commons will prove question how long have you been in the trade? answer nearly thirty years question the trade is at present much depressed? answer yes sadly question what is your opinion of the cause of that distress? answer i think it is owing to a number of watches that have been made so exceedingly bad that they will hardly look at them in the foreign markets; all with a handsome outside show and the works hardly fit for anything question do you mean to say that all the watches made in this country are of that description? answer no; only a number which are made up by some of the jews and other low manufacturers i recollect something of the sort years ago of a falloff of the east india work owing to there being a number of handsomelooking watches sent out for instance with hands on and figures as if they shewed seconds and had not any work regular to shew the seconds the hand went round but it was not regular question they had no perfect movements? answer no they had not; that was a long time since and we had not any east india work for a long time afterwards in the home market inferior but showy watches are made at a cheap rate which are not warranted by the maker to go above half an hour; about the time occupied by the jew pedlar in deluding his country customer  the practice in retail linendrapers' shops of calling certain articles yard wide when the real width is perhaps only seveneighths or threequarters arose at first from fraud which being detected custom was pleaded in its defence but the result is that the vender is constantly obliged to measure the width of his goods in the customer's presence in all these instances the object of the seller is to get a higher price than his goods would really produce if their quality were known; and the purchaser if not himself a skilful judge which rarely happens to be the case must pay some person in the shape of an additional money price who has skill to distinguish and integrity to furnish articles of the quality agreed on but as the confidence of persons in their own judgement is usually great large numbers will always flock to the cheap dealer who thus attracting many customers from the honest tradesman obliges him to charge a higher price for his judgement and character than without such competition he could afford to do  there are few things which the public are less able to judge of than the quality of drugs; and when these are compounded into medicines it is scarcely possible even for medical men to decide whether pure or adulterated ingredients have been employed this circumstance concurring with the present injudicious mode of paying for medical assistance has produced a curious effect on the price of medicines apothecaries instead of being paid for their services and skill are remunerated by being allowed to place a high charge upon their medicines which are confessedly of very small pecuniary value the effect of such a system is an inducement to prescribe more medicine than is necessary; and in fact even with the present charges the apothecary in ninetynine cases out of a hundred cannot be fairly remunerated unless the patient either takes or pays for more physic than he really requires the apparent extravagance of the charge of eighteen pence for a twoounce phial* of medicine is obvious to many who do not reflect on the fact that a great part of the charge is in reality payment for the exercise of professional skill as the same charge is made by the apothecary whether he attends the patient or merely prepares the prescription of a physician the chemist and druggist soon offered to furnish the same commodity at a greatly diminished price but the eighteen pence charged by the apothecary might have been fairly divided into two parts three pence for medicine and bottle and fifteen pence for attendance the chemist therefore who never attends his customers if he charges only a shilling for the same medicine realizes a profit of or per cent upon its value this enormous profit has called into existence a multitude of competitors; and in this instance the impossibility of verifying has in a great measure counteracted the beneficial effects of competition the general adulteration of drugs even at the extremely high price at which they are retailed as medicine enables those who are supposed to sell them in an unadulterated state to make large profits whilst the same evil frequently disappoints the expectation and defeats the skill of the most eminent physician it is difficult to point out a remedy for this evil without suggesting an almost total change in the system of medical practice if the apothecary were to charge for his visits and to reduce his medicines to onefourth or onefifth of their present price he would still have an interest in procuring the best drugs for the sake of his own reputation or skill or if the medical attendant who is paid more highly for his time were to have several pupils he might himself supply the medicines without a specific charge and his pupils would derive improvement from compounding them as well as from examining the purity of the drugs he would purchase the public would gain several advantages by this arrangement in the first place it would be greatly for the interest of the medical practitioner to have the best drugs; it would be in his interest also not to give more physic than needful; and it would enable him through some of his more advanced pupils to watch more frequently the changes of any malady  there are many articles of hardware which it is impossible for the purchaser to verify at the time of purchase or even afterwards without defacing them plated harness and coach furniture may be adduced as examples these are usually of wrought iron covered with silver owing their strength to the one and a certain degree of permanent beauty to the other metal both qualities are occasionally much impaired by substituting cast for wroughtiron and by plating with soft solder tin and lead instead of with hard solder silver and brass the loss of strength is the greatest evil in this case; for cast iron though made for this purpose more tough than usual by careful annealing is still much weaker than wroughtiron and serious accidents often arise from harness giving way in plating with soft solder a very thin plate of silver is made to cover the iron but it is easily detached particularly by a low degree of heat hard soldering gives a better coat of silver which is very firmly attached and is not easily injured unless by a very high degree of heat the inferior can be made to look nearly as well as the better article and the purchaser can scarcely discover the difference without cutting into it  the principle that price at any moment is dependent on the relation of the supply to the demand is true to the full extent only when the whole supply is in the hands of a very large number of small holders and the demand is caused by the wants of another set of persons each of whom requires only a very small quantity and the reason appears to be that it is only in such circumstances that a uniform average can be struck between the feelings the passions the prejudices the opinions and the knowledge of both parties if the supply or present stock in hand be entirely in the possession of one person he will naturally endeavour to put such a price upon it as shall produce by its sale the greatest quantity of money; but he will be guided in this estimate of the price at which he will sell both by the knowledge that increased price will cause a diminished consumption and by the desire to realize his profit before a new supply shall reach the market from some other quarter if however the same stock is in the hands of several dealers there will be an immediate competition between them arising partly from their different views of the duration of the present state of supply and partly from their own peculiar circumstances with respect to the employment of their capital  the expense of ascertaining that the price charged is that which is legally due is sometimes considerable the inconvenience which this verification produces in the case of parcels sent by coaches is very great the time lost in recovering an overcharge generally amounts to so many times the value of the sum recovered that it is but rarely resorted to it seems worthy of consideration whether it would not be a convenience to the public if government were to undertake the general conveyance of parcels somewhat on the same system with that on which the post is now conducted the certainty of their delivery and the absence of all attempt at overcharge would render the prohibition of rival carriers unnecessary perhaps an experiment might be made on this subject by enlarging the weight allowed to be sent by the twopenny post and by conveying works in sheets by the general post this latter suggestion would be of great importance to literature and consequently to the circulation of knowledge as the postoffice regulations stand at present it constantly happens that persons who have an extensive reputation for science receive by post from foreign countries works or parts of works for which they are obliged to pay a most extravagant rate of postage or else refuse to take in some interesting communication in france and germany printed sheets of paper are forwarded by post at a very moderate expense and it is fit that the science and literature of england should be equally favoured  it is important if possible always to connect the name of the workman with the work he has executed this secures for him the credit or the blame he may justly deserve; and diminishes in some cases the necessity of verification the extent to which this is carried in literary works published in america is remarkable in the translation of the mecanique celeste by mr bowditch not merely the name of the printer but also those of the compositors are mentioned in the work  again if the commodity itself is of a perishable nature such for example as a cargo of ice imported into the port of london from norway a few summers since then time will supply the place of competition; and whether the article is in the possession of one or of many persons it will scarcely reach a monopoly price the history of cajeput oil during the last few months offers a curious illustration of the effect of opinion upon price in july of last year cajeput oil was sold exclusive of duty at d per ounce the disease which had ravaged the east was then supposed to be approaching our shores and its proximity created alarm at this period the oil in question began to be much talked of as a powerful remedy in that dreadful disorder; and in september it rose to the price of s and s the ounce in october there were few or no sales but in the early part of november the speculations in this substance reached their height and between the st and the th it realized the following prices s d s s d s d s s s s d s after november the holders of cajeput oil were anxious to sell at much lower rates; and in december a fresh arrival was offered by public sale at s and withdrawn being sold afterwards as it was understood by private contract at s or s d per oz since that time s d and s have been realized; and a fresh arrival which is daily expected march will probably reduce it below the price of july now it is important to notice that in november the time of greatest speculation the quantity in the market was held by few persons and that it frequently changed hands each holder being desirous to realize his profit the quantity imported since that time has also been considerable*  the effect of the equalization of price by an increased number of dealers may be observed in the price of the various securities sold at the stock exchange the number of persons who deal in the per cent stock being large any one desirous of selling can always dispose of his stock at oneeighth per cent under the market price; but those who wish to dispose of bank stock or of any other securities of more limited circulation are obliged to make a sacrifice of eight or ten times this amount upon each hundred pounds value  the frequent speculations in oil tallow and other commodities which must occur to the memory of most of my readers were always founded on the principle of purchasing up all the stock on hand and agreeing for the purchase of the expected arrivals; thus proving the opinion of capitalists to be that a larger average price may be procured by the stock being held by few persons notes  apothecaries frequently purchase these phials at the old bottle warehouses at ten shillings per gross; so that when their servant has washed them the cost of the phial is nearly one penny  i have understood that the price of camphor at the same time suffered similar changes  chapter  on the influence of durability on price  having now considered the circumstances that modify what may be called the momentary amount of price we must next examine a principle which seems to have an effect on its permanent average the durability of any commodity influences its cost in a permanent manner we have already stated that what may be called the momentary price of any commodity depends upon the proportion existing between the supply and demand and also upon the cost of verification the average price during a long period will depend upon the labour required for producing and bringing it to market as well as upon the average supply and demand; but it will also be influenced by the durability of the article manufactured many things in common use are substantially consumed in using a phosphorus match articles of food and a cigar are examples of this description some things after use become inapplicable to their former purposes as paper which has been printed upon but it is yet available for the cheesemonger or the trunkmaker some articles as pens are quickly worn out by use; and some are still valuable after a long continued wear there are others few perhaps in number which never wear out; the harder precious stones when well cut and polished are of this later class the fashion of the gold or silver mounting in which they are set may vary with the taste of the age and such ornaments are constantly exposed for sale as secondhand but the gems themselves when removed from their supports are never so considered a brilliant which has successively graced the necks of a hundred beauties or glittered for a century upon patrician brows is weighed by the diamond merchant in the same scale with another which has just escaped from the wheel of the lapidary and will be purchased or sold by him at the same price per carat the great mass of commodities is intermediate in its character between these two extremes and the periods of respective duration are very various it is evident that the average price of those things which are consumed in the act of using them can never be less than that of the labour of bringing them to market they may for a short time be sold for less but under such circumstances their production must soon cease altogether on the other hand if an article never wears out its price may continue permanently below the cost of the labour expended in producing it; and the only consequence will be that no further production will take place its price will continue to be regulated by the relation of the supply to the demand; and should that at any aftertime rise for a considerable period above the cost of production it will be again produced  articles become old from actual decay or the wearing out of their parts; from improved modes of constructing them; or from changes in their form and fashion required by the varying taste of the age in the two latter cases their utility is but little diminished; and being less sought after by those who have hitherto employed them they are sold at a reduced price to a class of society rather below that of their former possessors many articles of furniture such as wellmade tables and chairs are thus found in the rooms of those who would have been quite unable to have purchased them when new; and we find constantly even in the houses of the more opulent large lookingglasses which have passed successively through the hands of several possessors changing only the fashion of their frames; and in some instances even this alteration is omitted an additional coat of gilding saving them from the character of being secondhand thus a taste for luxuries is propagated downwards in society' and after a short period the numbers who have acquired new wants become sufficient to excite the ingenuity of the manufacturer to reduce the cost of supplying them whilst he is himself benefited by the extended scale of demand  there is a peculiarity in lookingglasses with reference to the principle just mentioned the most frequent occasion of injury to them arises from accidental violence; and the peculiarity is that unlike most other articles when broken they are still of some value if a large mirror is accidentally cracked it is immediately cut into two or more smaller ones each of which may be perfect if the degree of violence is so great as to break it into many fragments these smaller pieces may be cut into squares for dressingglasses; and if the silvering is injured it can either be resilvered or used as plateglass for glazing windows the addition from our manufactories to the stock of plateglass in the country is annually about two hundred and fifty thousand square feet it would be very difficult to estimate the quantity annually destroyed or exported but it is probably small; and the effect of these continual additions is seen in the diminished price and increased consumption of the article almost all the better order of shop fronts are now glazed with it if it were quite indestructible the price would continually diminish; and unless an increased demand arose from new uses or from a greater number of customers a single manufactory unchecked by competition would ultimately be compelled to shut up driven out of the market by the permanance of its own productions  the metals are in some degree permanent although several of them are employed in such forms that they are ultimately lost copper is a metal of which a great proportion returns to use a part of that employed in sheathing ships and covering houses is lost from corrosion; but the rest is generally remelted some is lost in small brass articles and some is consumed in the formation of salts roman vitriol sulphate of copper verdigris acetate of copper and verditer gold is wasted in gilding and in embroidering; but a portion of this is recovered by burning the old articles some portion is lost by the wear of gold but upon the whole it possesses considerable permanence iron a proportion of this metal is wasted by oxidation in small nails in fine wire; by the wear of tools and of the tire of wheels and by the formation of some dyes but much both of cast and of wroughtiron returns to use lead is wasted in great quantities some portion of that which is used in pipes and in sheets for covering roofs returns to the meltingpot; but large quantities are consumed in the form of small shot or sometimes in that of musket balls litharge and red lead for white and red paints for glassmaking for glazing pottery and for sugar of lead acetate of lead silver is rather a permanent metal some portion is consumed in the wear of coin in that of silver plate and a portion in silvering and embroidering tin the chief waste of this metal arises from tinned iron; some is lost in solder and in solutions for the dyers  chapter  of price as measured by money  the money price at which an article sells furnishes us with comparatively little information respecting its value if we compare distant intervals of time and different countries; for gold and silver in which price is usually measured are themselves subject like all other commodities to changes in value; nor is there any standard to which these variations can be referred the average price of a certain quality of different manufactured articles or of raw produce has been suggested as a standard; but a new difficulty then presents itself; for the improved methods of producing such articles render their money price extremely variable within very limited periods the annexed table will afford a striking instance of this kind of change within a period of only twelve years  prices of the following articles at birmingham in the undermentioned years  description s d s d s d s d anvils cwt   awls polished liverpool

and factors in all our manufacturing and commercial towns to the great importance both for their own interests and for that of the population to which their capital gives employment of collecting with care such averages from the actual sales registered in their books nor perhaps would it be without its use to suggest that such averages would be still more valuable if collected from as many different quarters as possible; that the quantity of the goods from which they are deduced together with the greatest deviations from the mean ought to be given; and that if a small committee were to undertake the task it would give great additional weight to the information political economists have been reproached with too small a use of facts and too large an employment of theory if facts are wanting let it be remembered that the closetphilosopher is unfortunately too little acquainted with the admirable arrangements of the factory and that no class of persons can supply so readily and with so little sacrifice of time the data on which all the reasonings of political economists are founded as the merchant and manufacturer; and unquestionably to no class are the deductions to which they give rise so important nor let it be feared that erroneous deductions may be made from such recorded facts the errors which arise from the absence of facts are far more numerous and more durable than those which result from unsound reasoning respecting true data  the great diminution in price of the articles here enumerated may have arisen from several causes the alteration in the value of the currency the increased value of gold in consequence of the increased demand for coin the first of these causes may have had some influence and the second may have had a very small effect upon the two first quotations of prices but none at all upon the two latter ones the diminished rate of profit produced by capital however employed this may be estimated by the average price of three per cents at the periods stated the diminished price of the raw materials out of which these articles were manufactured the raw material is principally brass and iron and the reduction upon it may in some measure be estimated by the diminished price of iron and brass wire in the cost of which articles the labour bears a less proportion than it does in many of the others the smaller quantity of raw material employed and perhaps in some instances an inferior quality of workmanship the improved means by which the same effect was produced by diminished labour  in order to afford the means of estimating the influence of these several causes the following table is subjoined   average price of l s d l s d l s d l s d l s d l s d gold per oz    value of currency per cent  price of per cent

unaccompanied by any explanation might possibly lead to erroneous conclusions i subjoin the following observations for which i am indebted to the kindness of mr tooke who may yet i hope be induced to continue his valuable work on high and low prices through the important period which has elapsed since its publication 'the table commences with and exhibits a great falling off in the price of wheat and iron coincidently with a fall in the price of gold and leading to the inference of cause and effect now as regards wheat it so happened that in it reached its highest price in consequence of a series of bad harvests when relief by importation was difficult and enormously expensive in december whilst the price of gold had risen to l the price of wheat had fallen to s or per cent under what it had been in the spring of ; proving clearly that the two articles were under the influence of opposite causes 'again in the freight and insurance on swedish iron were so much higher than at present as to account for nearly the whole of the difference of price and in there had been an extensive speculation which had raised the price of all iron so that a part of the subsequent decline was a mere reaction from a previously unfounded elevation more recently in there was a great speculative rise in the article which served as a strong stimulus to increased production this aided by improved power of machinery has proceeded to such an extent as fully to account for the fall of price' to these reflections i will only add that the result of my own observation leads me to believe that by far the most influential of these causes has been the invention of cheaper modes of manufacturing the extent to which this can be carried while a profit can yet be realized at the reduced price is truly astonishing as the following fact which rests on good authority will prove twenty years since a brass knob for the locks of doors was made at birmingham; the price at that time being s d per dozen the same article is now manufactured having the same weight of metal and an equal or in fact a slightly superior finish at s d per dozen one circumstance which has produced this economy in the manufacture is that the lathe on which these knobs are finished is now turned by a steamengine; so that the workman relieved from that labour can make them twenty times as fast as he did formerly  the difference

wish to compare the value of any article at different periods of time it is clear that neither any one substance nor even the combination of all manufactured goods can furnish us with an invariable unit by which to form our scale of estimation mr malthus has proposed for this purpose to consider a day's labour of an agricultural labourer as the unit to which all value should be referred thus if we wish to compare the value of twenty yards of broad cloth in saxony at the present time with that of the same kind and quantity of cloth fabricated in england two centuries ago we must find the number of days' labour the cloth would have purchased in england at the time mentioned and compare it with the number of days' labour which the same quantity of cloth will now purchase in saxony agricultural labour appears to have been selected because it exists in all countries and employs a large number of persons and also because it requires a very small degree of previous instruction it seems in fact to be merely the exertion of a man's physical force; and its value above that of a machine of equal power arises from its portability and from the facility of directing its efforts to arbitrary and continually fluctuating purposes it may perhaps be worthy of enquiry whether a more constant average might not be deduced from combining with this species of labour those trades which require but a moderate exertion of skill and which likewise exist in all civilized countries such as those of the blacksmith and carpenter etc* in all such comparisons there is however another element which though not essentially necessary will yet add much to our means of judging it is an estimate of the quantity of that food on which the labourer usually subsists which is necessary for his daily support compared with the quantity which his daily wages will purchase  the existence of a class of middlemen between small producers and merchants is frequently advantageous to both parties; and there are certain periods in the history of several manufactures which naturally call that class of traders into existence there are also times when the advantage ceasing the custom of employing them also terminates; the middlemen especially when numerous as they sometimes are in retail trades enhancing the price without equivalent good thus in the recent examination by the house of commons into the state of the coal trade it appears that fivesixths of the london public is supplied by a class of middlemen who are called in the trade brass plate coal merchants these consist principally of merchants' clerks gentlemen's servants and others who have no wharfs of their own but merely give their orders to some true coal merchant who sends in the coals from his wharf the brass plate coal merchants of course receiving a commission for his agency  in italy this system is carried to a great extent amongst the voituriers or persons who undertake to convey travellers there are some possessed of greater fluency and a more persuasive manner who frequent the inns where the english resort and who as soon as they have made a bargain for the conveyance of a traveller go out amongst their countrymen and procure some other voiturier to do the job for a considerably smaller sum themselves pocketing the difference a short time before the day of starting the contractor appears before his customer in great distress regretting his inability to perform the journey on account of the dangerous illness of a mother or some relative and requesting to have his cousin or brother substituted for him the english traveller rarely fails to acquiesce in this change and often praises the filial piety of the rogue who has deceived him notes  much information for such an enquiry is to be found for the particular period to which it refers in the report of the committee of the house of commons on manufacturers' employment july chapter  of raw materials  although the cost of any article may be reduced in its ultimate analysis to the quantity of labour by which it was produced; yet it is usual in a certain state of the manufacture of most substances to call them by the term raw material thus iron when reduced from the ore and rendered malleable is in a state fitted for application to a multitude of useful purposes and is the raw material out of which most of our tools are made in this stage of its manufacture but a moderate quantity of labour has been expended on the substance; and it becomes an interesting subject to trace the various proportions in which raw material in this sense of the term and labour unite to constitute the value of many of the productions of the arts  gold leaf consists of a portion of the metal beaten out to so great a degree of thinness as to allow a greenishblue light to be transmitted through its pores about square inches of this are sold in the form of a small book containing leaves of gold for s d in this case the raw material or gold is worth rather less than twothirds of the manufactured article in the case of silver leaf the labour considerably exceeds the value of the material a book of fifty leaves which would cover above square inches is sold for s d  we may trace the relative influence of the two causes above referred to in the prices of fine gold chains made at venice the sizes of these chains are known by numbers the smallest having been in no and the numbers  etc progressively increasing in size the following table shews the numbers and the prices of those made at that time* the first column gives the number by which the chain is known; the second expresses the weight in grains of one inch in length of each chain; the third column the number of links in the same length; and the last expresses the price in francs worth tenpence each of a venetian braccio or about two english feet of each chain  venetian gold chains price of a venetian braccio equal to weight of number of links two feet inch no one inch in grains in one inch english  to  francs           amongst these chains that numbered and that numbered are exactly of the same price although the quantity of gold in the latter is twentytwo times as much as in the former the difficulty of making the smallest chain is so great that the women who make it cannot work above two hours at a time as we advance from the smaller chain the proportionate value of the work to the worth of the material becomes less and less until at the numbers and these two elements of cost balance each other after which the difficulty of the work decreases and the value of the material increases  the quantity of labour expended on these chains is however incomparably less than that which is applied in some of the manufactures of iron in the case of the smallest venetian chain the value of the labour is not above thirty times that of the gold the pendulum spring of a watch which governs the vibrations of the balance costs at the retail price two pence and weighs fifteen onehundredths of a grain whilst the retail price of a pound of the best iron the raw material out of which fifty thousand such springs are made is exactly the same sum of two pence  the

depends is the division of labour amongst the persons who perform the work the first application of this principle must have been made in a very early stage of society for it must soon have been apparent that a larger number of comforts and conveniences could be acquired by each individual if one man restricted his occupation to the art of making bows another to that of building houses a third boats and so on this division of labour into trades was not however the result of an opinion that the general riches of the community would be increased by such an arrangement; but it must have arisen from the circumstance of each individual so employed discovering that he himself could thus make a greater profit of his labour than by pursuing more varied occupations society must have made considerable advances before this principle could have been carried into the workshop; for it is only in countries which have attained a high degree of civilization and in articles in which there is a great competition amongst the producers that the most perfect system of the division of labour is to be observed the various principles on which the advantages of this system depend have been much the subject of discussion amongst writers on political economy; but the relative importance of their influence does not appear in all cases to have been estimated with sufficient precision it is my intention in the first instance to state shortly those principles and then to point out what appears to me to have been omitted by those who have previously treated the subject  of the time required for learning it will readily be admitted that the portion of time occupied in the acquisition of any art will depend on the difficulty of its execution; and that the greater the number of distinct processes the longer will be the time which the apprentice must employ in acquiring it five or seven years have been adopted in a great many trades as the time considered requisite for a lad to acquire a sufficient knowledge of his art and to enable him to repay by his labour during the latter portion of his time the expense incurred by his master at its commencement if however instead of learning all the different processes for making a needle for instance his attention be confined to one operation the portion of time consumed unprofitably at the commencement of his apprenticeship will be small and all the rest of it will be beneficial to his master and consequently if there be any competition amongst the masters the apprentice will be able to make better terms and diminish the period of his servitude again the facility of acquiring skill in a single process and the early period of life at which it can be made a source of profit will induce a greater number of parents to bring up their children to it; and from this circumstance also the number of workmen being increased the wages will soon fall  of waste of materials in learning a certain quantity of material will in all cases be consumed unprofitably or spoiled by every person who learns an art; and as he applies himself to each new process he will waste some of the raw material or of the partly manufactured commodity but if each man commit this waste in acquiring successively every process the quantity of waste will be much greater than if each person confine his attention to one process; in this view of the subject therefore the division of labour will diminish the price of production  another advantage resulting from the division of labour is the saving of that portion of time which is always lost in changing from one occupation to another when the human hand or the human head has been for some time occupied in any kind of work it cannot instantly change its employment with full effect the muscles of the limbs employed have acquired a flexibility during their exertion and those not in action a stiffness during rest which renders every change slow and unequal in the commencement long habit also produces in the muscles exercised a capacity for enduring fatigue to a much greater degree than they could support under other circumstances a similar result seems to take place in any change of mental exertion; the attention bestowed on the new subject not being so perfect at first as it becomes after some exercise  change of tools the employment of different tools in the successive processes is another cause of the loss of time in changing from one operation to another if these tools are simple and the change is not frequent the loss of time is not considerable; but in many processes of the arts the tools are of great delicacy requiring accurate adjustment every time they are used; and in many cases the time employed in adjusting bears a large proportion to that employed in using the tool the slidingrest the dividing and the drillingengine are of this kind; and hence in manufactories of sufficient extent it is found to be good economy to keep one machine constantly employed in one kind of work one lathe for example having a screw motion to its slidingrest along the whole length of its bed is kept constantly making cylinders; another having a motion for equalizing the velocity of the work at the point at which it passes the tool is kept for facing surfaces; whilst a third is constantly employed in cutting wheels  skill acquired by frequent repetition of the same processes the constant repetition of the same process necessarily produces in the workman a degree of excellence and rapidity in his particular department which is never possessed by a person who is obliged to execute many different processes this rapidity is still further increased from the circumstance that most of the operations in factories where the division of labour is carried to a considerable extent are paid for as piecework it is difficult to estimate in numbers the effect of this cause upon production in nailmaking adam smith has stated that it is almost three to one; for he observes that a smith accustomed to make nails but whose whole business has not been that of a nailer can make only from eight hundred to a thousand per day; whilst a lad who had never exercised any other trade can make upwards of two thousand three hundred a day  in different trades the economy of production arising from the lastmentioned cause will necessarily be different the case of nailmaking is perhaps rather an extreme one it must however be observed that in one sense this is not a permanent source of advantage; for though it acts at the commencement of an establishment yet every month adds to the skill of the workmen; and at the end of three or four years they will not be very far behind those who have never practised any other branch of their art upon an occasion when a large issue of banknotes was required a clerk at the bank of england signed his name consisting of seven letters including the initial of his christian name five thousand three hundred times during eleven working hours besides arranging the notes he had signed in parcels of fifty each  the division of labour suggests the contrivance of tools and machinery to execute its processes when each processes by which any article is produced is the sole occupation of one individual his whole attention being devoted to a very limited and simple operation improvements in the form of his tools or in the mode of using them are much more likely to occur to his mind than if it were distracted by a greater variety of circumstances such an improvement in the tool is generally the first step towards a machine if a piece of metal is to be cut in a lathe for example there is one particular angle at which the cuttingtool must be held to insure the cleanest cut; and it is quite natural that the idea of fixing the tool at that angle should present itself to an intelligent workman the necessity of moving the tool slowly and in a direction parallel to itself would suggest the use of a screw and thus arises the slidingrest it was probably the idea of mounting a chisel in a frame to prevent its cutting too deeply which gave rise to the common carpenter's plane in cases where a blow from a hammer is employed experience teaches the proper force required the transition from the hammer held in the hand to one mounted upon an axis and lifted regularly to a certain height by some mechanical contrivance requires perhaps a greater degree of invention than those just instanced; yet it is not difficult to perceive that if the hammer always falls from the same height its effect must be always the same  when each process has been reduced to the use of some simple tool the union of all these tools actuated by one moving power constitutes a machine in contriving tools and simplifying processes the operative workmen are perhaps most successful; but it requires far other habits to combine into one machine these scattered arts a previous education as a workman in the peculiar trade is undoubtedly a valuable preliminary; but in order to make such combinations with any reasonable expectation of success an extensive knowledge of machinery and the power of making mechanical drawings are essentially requisite these accomplishments are now much more common than they were formerly and their absence was perhaps one of the causes of the multitude of failures in the early history of many of our manufactures  such are the principles usually assigned as the causes of the advantage resulting from the division of labour as in the view i have taken of the question the most important and influential cause has been altogether unnoticed i shall restate those principles in the words of adam smith the great increase in the quantity of work which in consequence of the division of labour the same number of people are capable of performing is owing to three different circumstances first to the increase of dexterity in every particular workman; secondly to the saving of time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another; and lastly to the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour and enable one man to do the work of many now although all these are important causes and each has its influence on the result; yet it appears to me that any explanation of the cheapness of manufactured articles as consequent upon the division of labour would be incomplete if the following principle were omitted to be stated that the master manufacturer by dividing the work to be executed into different processes each requiring different degrees of skill or of force can purchase exactly that precise quantity of both which is necessary for each process; whereas if the whole work were executed by one workman that person must possess sufficient skill to perform the most difficult and sufficient strength to execute the most laborious of the operations into which the art is divided*  as the clear apprehension of this principle upon which a great part of the economy arising from the division of labour depends is of considerable importance it may be desirable to point out its precise and numerical application in some specific manufacture the art of making needles is perhaps that which i should have selected for this illustration as comprehending a very large number of processes remarkably different in their nature; but the less difficult art of pinmaking has some claim to attention from its having been used by adam smith; and i am confirmed in the choice of it by the circumstance of our possessing a very accurate and minute description of that art as practised in france above half a century ago  pinmaking in the manufacture of pins in england the following processes are employed  wiredrawing a the brass wire used for making pins is purchased by the manufacturer in coils of about twentytwo inches in diameter each weighing about thirtysix pounds b the coils are wound off into smaller ones of about six inches in diameter and between one and two pounds' weight c the diameter of this wire is now reduced by drawing it repeatedly through holes in steel plates until it becomes of the size required for the sort of pins intended to be made during this process the wire is hardened and to prevent its breaking it must be annealed two or three times according to the diminution of diameter required d the coils are then soaked in sulphuric acid largely diluted with water in order to clean them and are then beaten on stone for the purpose of removing any oxidated coating which may adhere to them these operations are usually performed by men who draw and clean from thirty to thirtysix pounds of wire a day they are paid at the rate of five farthings per pound and generally earn about s d per day m perronnet made some experiments on the extension the wire undergoes in passing through each hole he took a piece of thick swedish brass wire and found  feet inches its length to be before drawing  after passing the first hole  second hole  third hole it was now annealed and the length became  after passing the fourth hole  fifth hole  sixth hole  and finally after passing through six other holes the holes through which the wire was drawn were not in this experiment of regularly decreasing diameter it is extremely difficult to make such holes and still more to preserve them in their original dimensions  straightening the wire the coil of wire now passes into the hands of a woman assisted by a boy or girl a few nails or iron pins not quite in a line are fixed into one end of a wooden table about twenty feet in length; the end of the wire is passed alternately between these nails and is then pulled to the other end of the table the object of this process is to straighten the wire which had acquired a considerable curvature in the small coils in which it had been wound the length thus straightened is cut off and the remainder of the coil is drawn into similar lengths about seven nails or pins are employed in straightening the wire and their adjustment is a matter of some nicety it seems that by passing the wire between the first three nails or pins a bend is produced in an opposite direction to that which the wire had in the coil; this bend by passing the next two nails is reduced to another less curved in the first direction and so on till the curve of the wire may at last be confounded with a straight line  pointing a a man next takes about three hundred of these straightened pieces in a parcel and putting them into a gauge cuts off from one end by means of a pair of shears moved by his foot a portion equal in length to rather more than six pins he continues this operation until the entire parcel is reduced into similar pieces b the next step is to sharpen the ends for this purpose the operator sits before a steel mill which is kept rapidly revolving it consists of a cylinder about six inches in diameter and two and a half inches broad faced with steel which is cut in the manner of a file another cylinder is fixed on the same axis at a few inches distant; the file on the edge of which is of a finer kind and is used for finishing off the points the workman now takes up a parcel of the wires between the finger and thumb of each hand and presses the ends obliquely on the mill taking care with his fingers and thumbs to make each wire slowly revolve upon its axis having thus pointed all the pieces at one end he reverses them and performs the same operation on the other this process requires considerable skill but it is not unhealthy; whilst the similar process in needlemaking is remarkably destructive of health c the pieces now pointed at both ends are next placed in gauges and the pointed ends are cut off by means of shears to the proper length of which the pins are to be made the remaining portions of the wire are now equal to about four pins in length and are again pointed at each end and their lengths again cut off this process is repeated a third time and the small portion of wire left in the middle is thrown amongst the waste to be melted along with the dust arising from the sharpening it is usual for a man his wife and a child to join in performing these processes; and they are paid at the rate of five farthings per pound they can point from thirtyfour to thirtysix and a half pounds per day and gain from s d to s which may be apportioned thus; s d the man s the woman d to the boy or girl  twisting and cutting the heads the next process is making the heads for this purpose a a boy takes a piece of wire of the same diameter as the pin to be headed which he fixes on an axis that can be made to revolve rapidly by means of a wheel and strap connected with it this wire is called the mould he then takes a smaller wire which having passed through an eye in a small tool held in his left hand he fixes close to the bottom of the mould the mould is now made to revolve rapidly by means of the right hand and the smaller wire coils round it until it has covered the whole length of the mould the boy now cuts the end of the spiral connected with the foot of the mould and draws it off b when a sufficient quantity of heading is thus made a man takes from thirteen to twenty of these spirals in his left hand between his thumb and three outer fingers these he places in such a manner that two turns of the spiral shall be beyond the upper edge of a pair of shears and with the forefinger of the same hand he feels that only two turns do so project with his right hand he closes the shears; and the two turns of the spiral being cut off drop into a basin; the position of the forefinger preventing the heads from flying about when cut off the workmen who cut the heads are usually paid at the rate of d to d per pound for large heads but a higher price is given for the smaller heading out of this they pay the boy who spins the spiral; he receives from d to d a day a good workman can cut from six to about thirty pounds of heading per day according to its size  heading the process of fixing the head on the body of the pin is usually executed by women and children each operator sits before a small steel stake having a cavity into which one half of the intended head will fit; immediately above is a steel die having a corresponding cavity for the other half of the head this latter die can be raised by a pedal moved by the foot the weight of the hammer is from seven to ten pounds and it falls through a very small space perhaps from one to two inches the cavities in the centre of these dies are connected with the edge of a small groove to admit of the body of the pin which is thus prevented from being flattened by the blow of the die a the operator with his left hand dips the pointed end of the body of a pin into a tray of heads; having passed the point through one of them he carries it along to the other end with the forefinger he now takes the pin in the right hand and places the head in the cavity of the stake and lifting the die with his foot allows it to fall on the head this blow tightens the head on the shank which is then turned round and the head receives three or four blows on different parts of its circumference the women and children who fix the heads are paid at the rate of s d for every twenty thousand a skilful operator can with great exertion do twenty thousand per day but from ten to fifteen thousand is the usual quantity children head a much smaller number varying of course with the degree of their skill about one per cent of the pins are spoiled in the process; these are picked out afterwards by women and are reserved along with the waste from other processes for the meltingpot the die in which the heads are struck is varied in form according to the fashion of the time; but the repeated blows to which it is subject render it necessary that it should be repaired after it has been used for about thirty pounds of pins  tinning the pins are now fit to be tinned a process which is usually executed by a man assisted by his wife or by a lad the quantity of pins operated upon at this stage is usually fiftysix pounds a they are first placed in a pickle in order to remove any grease or dirt from their surface and also to render them rough which facilitates the adherence of the tin with which they are to be covered b they are then placed in a boiler full of a solution of tartar in water in which they are mixed with a quantity of tin in small grains in this they are generally kept boiling for about two hours and a half and are then removed into a tub of water into which some bran has been thrown for the purpose of washing off the acid liquor c they are then taken out and being placed in wooden trays are well shaken in dry bran this removes any water adhering to them; and by giving the wooden tray a peculiar kind of motion the pins are thrown up and the bran gradually flies off and leaves them behind in the tray the man who pickles and tins the pins usually gets one penny per pound for the work and employs himself during the boiling of one batch of pins in drying those previously tinned he can earn about s per day; but out of this he pays about s for his assistant  papering the pins come from the tinner in wooden bowls with the points projecting in all directions the arranging of them side by side in paper is generally performed by women a a woman takes up some and places them on a comb and shaking them some of the pins fall back into the bowl and the rest being caught by their heads are detained between the teeth of the comb b having thus arranged them in a parallel direction she fixes the requisite number between two pieces of iron having twentyfive small grooves at equal distances; c and having previously doubled the paper she presses it against the points of the pins until they have passed through the two folds which are to retain them the pins are then relieved from the grasp of the tool and the process is repeated a woman gains about s d per day by papering; but children are sometimes employed who earn from d per day and upwards  having thus generally described the various processes of pinmaking and having stated the usual cost of each it will be convenient to present a tabular view of the time occupied by each process and its cost as well as the sums which can be earned by the persons who confine themselves solely to each process as the rate of wages is itself fluctuating and as the prices paid and quantities executed have been given only between certain limits it is not to be expected that this table can represent the cost of each part of the work with the minutest accuracy nor even that it shall accord perfectly with the prices above given but it has been drawn up with some care and will be quite sufficient to serve as the basis of those reasonings which it is meant to illustrate a table nearly similar will be subjoined which has been deduced from a statement of m

wheel appears to have arisen from the person so occupied being unemployed during half his time whilst the pointer went to another manufactory  it appears from the analysis we have given of the art of pinmaking that it occupies rather more than seven hours and a half of time for ten different individuals working in succession on the same material to convert it into a pound of pins; and that the total expense of their labour each being paid in the joint ratio of his skill and of the time he is employed amounts very nearly to s d but from an examination of the first of these tables it appears that the wages earned by the persons employed vary from d per day up to s and consequently the skill which is required for their respective employments may be measured by those sums now it is evident that if one person were required to make the whole pound of pins he must have skill enough to earn about s d per day whilst he is pointing the wires or cutting off the heads from the spiral coilsand s when he is whitening the pins; which three operations together would occupy little more than the seventeenth part of his time it is also apparent that during more than one half of his time he must be earning only s d per day in putting on the heads; although his skill if properly employed would in the same time produce nearly five times as much if therefore we were to employ for all the processes the man who whitens the pins and who earns s per day even supposing that he could make the pound of pins in an equally short time yet we must pay him for his time  pence or about s d the pins would therefore cost in making three times and three quarters as much as they now do by the application of the division of labour the higher the skill required of the workman in any one process of a manufacture and the smaller the time during which it is employed so much the greater will be the advantage of separating that process from the rest and devoting one person's attention entirely to it had we selected the art of needlemaking as our illustration the economy arising from the division of labour would have been still more striking; for the process of tempering the needles requires great skill attention and experience and although from three to four thousand are tempered at once the workman is paid a very high rate of wages in another process of the same manufacture drypointing which also is executed with great rapidity the wages earned by the workman reach from s to s s and even in some instances to s per day; whilst other processes are carried on by children paid at the rate of d per day  some further reflections suggested by the preceding analysis will be reserved until we have placed before the reader a brief description of a machine for making pins invented by an american it is highly ingenious in point of contrivance and in respect to its economical principles will furnish a strong and interesting contrast with the manufacture of pins by the human hand in this machine a coil of brass wire is placed on an axis; one end of this wire is drawn by a pair of rollers through a small hole in a plate of steel and is held there by a forceps as soon as the machine is put in action  the forceps draws the wire on to a distance equal in length to one pin a cutting edge of steel then descends close to the hole through which the wire entered and severs the piece drawn out  the forceps holding the piece thus separated moves on till it brings the wire to the centre of the chuck of a small lathe which opens to receive it whilst the forceps is returning to fetch another piece of wire the lathe revolves rapidly and grinds the projecting end of the wire upon a steel mill which advances towards it  after this first or coarse pointing the lathe stops and another forceps takes hold of the halfpointed pin which is instantly released by the opening of the chuck and conveys it to a similar chuck of an adjacent lathe which receives it and finishes the pointing on a finer steel mill  this mill again stops and another forceps removes the pointed pin into a pair of strong steel clams having a small groove in them by which they hold the pin very firmly a part of this groove which terminates at that edge of the steel clams which is intended to form the head of the pin is made conical a small round steel punch is now driven forcibly against the end of the wire thus clamped and the head of the pin is partially formed by compressing the wire into the conical cavity notes  i have already stated that this principle presented itself to me after a personal examination of a number of manufactories and workshops devoted to different purposes; but i have since found that it had been distinctly pointed out in the work of gioja nuovo prospetto delle scienze economiche tom to milano tom i capo iv  the great expense of turning the wheel appears to have arisen from the person so occupied being unemployed during half his time whilst the pointer went to another manufactory  chapter  on the division of labour  we have already mentioned what may perhaps appear paradoxical to some of our readers that the division of labour can be applied with equal success to mental as to mechanical operations and that it ensures in both the same economy of time a short account of its practical application in the most extensive series of calculations ever executed will offer an interesting illustration of this fact whilst at the same time it will afford an occasion for shewing that the arrangements which ought to regulate the interior economy of a manufactory are founded on principles of deeper root than may have been supposed and are capable of being usefully employed in preparing the road to some of the sublimest investigations of the human mind  in the midst of that excitement which accompanied the revolution of france and the succeeding wars the ambition of the nation unexhausted by its fatal passion for military renown was at the same time directed to some of the nobler and more permanent triumphs which mark the era of a people's greatness and which receive the applause of posterity long after their conquests have been wrested from them or even when their existence as a nation may be told only by the page of history amongst their enterprises of science the french government was desirous of producing a series of mathematical tables to facilitate the application of the decimal system which they had so recently adopted they directed therefore their mathematicians to construct such tables on the most extensive scale their most distinguished philosophers responding fully to the call of their country invented new methods for this laborious task; and a work completely answering the large demands of the government was produced in a remarkably short period of time m prony to whom the superintendence of this great undertaking was confided in speaking of its commencement observes je m'y livrai avec toute l'ardeur dont j'etois

d'appliquer a la connection de ces tables la division du travail dont les arts de commerce tirent un parti si avantageux pour reunir a la pernection de maind'oeuvre l'economie de la depense et du temps the circumstance which gave rise to this singular application of the principle of the division on labour is so interesting that no apology is necessary for introducing it from a small pamphlet printed at paris a few years since when a proposition was made by the english to the french government that the two countries should print these tables at their joint expense  the origin of the idea is related in the following extract c'est a un chapitre d'un ouvrage anglais* justement celebre i qu'est probablement due l'existence de l'ouvrage dont le gouvernement britannique veut faire jouir le monde savant voici l'anecdote m de prony s'etait engage avec les comites de gouvernement a composer pour la division centesimale du cercle des tables logarithmiques et trigonometriques qui non seulement ne laissassent rien a desirer quant a l'exactitude mais qui formassent le monument de calcul e plus vaste et le plus imposant qui eut jamais ete execute ou meme concu les logarithmes des nombres de a formaient a ce travail un supplement necessaire et exige il fut aise a m de prony de s'assurer que meme en s'associant trois ou quatre habiles cooperateurs la plus grande duree presumable de sa vie ne lui sufirai pas pour remplir ses engagements il etait occupe de cette facheuse pensee lorsque se trouvant devant la boutique d'un marchand de livres il appercut la belle edition anglaise de smith donnee a londres en il ouvrit le livre au hazard et tomba sur le premier chapitre qui traite de la division du travail et ou la fabrication des epingles est citee pour exemple a peine avaitil parcouru les premieres pages que par une espece d'inspiration il concut l'expedient de mettre ses logarithmes en manufacture comme les epingles il faisait en ce moment a l'ecole polytechnique des lecons sur une partie d'analyse liee a ce genre de travail la methode des differences et ses applications a l'interpolation il alla passer quelques jours a la campagne et revint a paris avec le plan de fabrication qui a ete suivi dans l'execution il rassembla deux ateliers qui faisai ent separement les memes calculs et se servaient de verification reciproque*  the ancient methods of computing tables were altogether inapplicable to such a proceeding m prony therefore wishing to avail himself of all the talent of his country in devising new methods formed the first section of those who were to take part in this enterprise out of five or six of the most eminent mathematicians in france first section the duty of this first section was to investigate amongst the various analytical expressions which could be found for the same function that which was most readily adapted to simple numerical calculation by many individuals employed at the same time this section had little or nothing to do with the actual numerical work when its labours were concluded the formulae on the use of which it had decided were delivered to the second section second section this section consisted of seven or eight persons of considerable acquaintance with mathematics and their duty was to convert into numbers the formulae put into their hands by the first section an operation of great labour; and then to deliver out these formulae to the members of the third section and receive from them the finished calculations the members of this second section had certain means of verifying the calculations without the necessity of repeating or even of examining the whole of the work done by the third section third section the members of this section whose number varied from sixty to eighty received certain numbers from the second section and using nothing more than simple addition and subtraction they returned to that section the tables in a finished state it is remarkable that ninetenths of this class had no knowledge of arithmetic beyond the two first rules which they were thus called upon to exercise and that these persons were usually found more correct in their calculations than those who possessed a more extensive knowledge of the subject  when it is stated that the tables thus computed occupy seventeen large folio volumes some idea may perhaps be formed of the labour from that part executed by the third class which may almost be termed mechanical requiring the least knowledge and by far the greatest exertions the first class were entirely exempt such labour can always be purchased at an easy rate the duties of the second class although requiring considerable skill in arithmetical operations were yet in some measure relieved by the higher interest naturally felt in those more difficult operations the exertions of the first class are not likely to require upon another occasion so much skill and labour as they did upon the first attempt to introduce such a method; but when the completion of a calculating engine shall have produced a substitute for the whole of the third section of computers the attention of analysts will naturally be directed to simplifying its application by a new discussion of the methods of converting analytical formulae into numbers  the proceeding of m prony in this celebrated system of calculation much resembles that of a skilful person about to construct a cotton or silk mill or any similar establishment having by his own genius or through the aid of his friends found that some improved machinery may be successfully applied to his pursuit he makes drawings of his plans of the machinery and may himself be considered as constituting the first section he next requires the assistance of operative engineers capable of executing the machinery he has designed some of whom should understand the nature of the processes to be carried on; and these constitute his second section when a sufficient number of machines have been made a multitude of other persons possessed of a lower degree of skill must be employed in using them; these form the third section but their work and the just performance of the machines must be still superintended by the second class  as the possibility of performing arithmetical calculations by machinery may appear to nonmathematical readers to be rather too large a postulate and as it is connected with the subject of the division of labour i shall here endeavour in a few lines to give some slight perception of the manner in which this can be doneand thus to remove a small portion of the veil which covers that apparent mystery  that nearly all tables of numbers which follow any law however complicated may be formed to a greater or less extent solely by the proper arrangement of the successive addition and subtraction of numbers befitting each table is a general principle which can be demonstrated to those only who are well acquainted with mathematics; but the mind even of the reader who is but very slightly acquainted with that science will readily conceive that it is not impossible by attending to the following example the subjoined table is the beginning of one in very extensive use which has been printed and reprinted very frequently in many countries and is called a table of square numbers  terms of table a table b first difference c second difference                                                                                any number in the table column a may be obtained by multiplying the number which expresses the distance of that term from the commencement of the table by itself; thus is the fifth term from the beginning of the table and multiplied by itself or by is equal to let us now subtract each term of this table from the next succeeding term and place the results in another column b which may be called first difference column if we again subtract each term of this first difference from the succeeding term we find the result is always the number column c; and that the same number will always recur in that column which may be called the second difference will appear to any person who takes the trouble to carry on the table a few terms further now when once this is admitted it is quite clear that provided the first term of the table the first term of the first differences and the first term of the second or constant difference are originally given we can continue the table of square numbers to any extent merely by addition for the series of first differences may be formed by repeatedly adding the constant difference to the first number in column b and we then have the series of numbers  etc and again by successively adding each of these to the first number of the table we produce the square numbers  having thus i hope thrown some light upon the theoretical part of the question i shall endeavour to shew that the mechanical execution of such an engine as would produce this series of numbers is not so far removed from that of ordinary machinery as might be conceived* let the reader imagine three clocks placed on a table side by side each having only one hand and each having a thousand divisions instead of twelve hours marked on the face; and every time a string is pulled let them strike on a bell the numbers of the divisions to which their hands point let him further suppose that two of the clocks for the sake of distinction called b and c have some mechanism by which the clock c advances the hand of the clock b one division for each stroke it makes upon its own bell and let the clock b by a similar contrivance advance the hand of the clock a one division for each stroke it makes on its own bell with such an arrangement having set the hand of the clock a to the division i that of b to iii and that of c to ii let the reader imagine the repeating parts of the clocks to be set in motion continually in the following order vizpull the string of clock a; pull the string of clock b; pull the string of clock c the table on the following page will then express the series of movements and their results if now only those divisions struck or pointed at by the clock a be attended to and written down it will be found that they produce the series of the squares of the natural numbers such a series could of course be carried by this mechanism only so far as the numbers which can be expressed by three figures; but this may be sufficient to give some idea of the constructionand was in fact the point to which the first model of the calculating engine now in progress extended  we have seen then that the effect of the division of labour both in mechanical and in mental operations is that it enables us to purchase and apply to each process precisely that quantity of skill and knowledge which is required for it we avoid employing any part of the time of a man who can get eight or ten shillings a day by his skill in tempering needles in turning a wheel which can be done for sixpence a day; and we equally avoid the loss arising from the employment of an accomplished mathematician in performing the lowest processes of arithmetic  the division of labour cannot be successfully practised unless there exists a great demand for its produce; and it requires a large capital to be employed in those arts in which it is used in watchmaking it has been carried perhaps to the greatest extent it was stated in evidence before a committee of the house of commons that there are a hundred and two distinct branches of this art to each of which a boy may be put apprentice and that he only learns his master's department and is unable after his apprenticeship has expired without subsequent instruction to work at any other branch the watchfinisher whose business is to put together the scattered parts is the only one out of the hundred and two persons who can work in any other department than his own  in one of the most difficult arts that of mining great improvements have resulted from the judicious distribution of the duties; and under the arrangments which have gradually been introduced the whole system of the mine and its government is now placed under the control of the following officers  a manager who has the general knowledge of all that is to be done and who may be assisted by one or more skilful

le gouvernement anglais des grandes tables logarithmiques et trigonometriques de m de prony de l'imprimerie de f didot december  p  since the publication of the second edition of this work one portion of the engine which i have been constructing for some years past has been put together it calculates in three columns a table with its first and second differences each column can be expressed as far as five figures so that these fifteen figures constitute about one ninth part of the larger engine the ease and precision with which it works leave no room to doubt its success in the more extended

manufacture  the great competition introduced by machinery and the application of the principle of the subdivision of labour render it necessary for each producer to be continually on the watch to discover improved methods by which the cost of the article he manufactures may be reduced; and with this view it is of great importance to know the precise expense of every process as well as of the wear and tear of machinery which is due to it the same information is desirable for those by whom the manufactured goods are distributed and sold; because it enables them to give reasonable answers or explanations to the objections of enquirers and also affords them a better chance of suggesting to the manufacturer changes in the fashion of his goods which may be suitable either to the tastes or to the finances of his customers to the statesman such knowledge is still more important; for without it he must trust entirely to others and can form no judgement worthy of confidence of the effect any tax may produce or of the injury the manufacturer or the country may suffer by its imposition  one of the first advantages which suggests itself as likely to arise from a correct analysis of the expense of the several processes of any manufacture is the indication which it would furnish of the course in which improvement should be directed if a method could be contrived of diminishing by one fourth the time required for fixing on the heads of pins the expense of making them would be reduced about thirteen per cent; whilst a reduction of one half the time employed in spinning the coil of wire out of which the heads are cut would scarcely make any sensible difference in the cost of manufacturing of the whole article it is therefore obvious that the attention would be much more advantageously directed to shortening the former than the latter process  the expense of manufacturing in a country where machinery is of the rudest kind and manual labour is very cheap is curiously exhibited in the price of cotton cloth in the island of java the cotton in the seed is sold by the picul which is a weight of about lbs not above one fourth or one fifth of this weight however is cotton the natives by means of rude wooden rollers can only separate about  lb of cotton from the seed by one day's labour a picul of cleansed cotton therefore is worth between four and five times the cost of the impure article; and the prices of the same substance in its different stages of manufacture arefor one picul  dollars cotton in the seed to  clean cotton to  cotton thread  cotton thread dyed blue  good ordinary cotton cloth  thus it appears that the expense of spinning in java is per cent on the value of the raw material; the expense of dying thread blue is per cent on its value; and that of weaving cotton thread into cloth per cent on its value the expense of spinning cotton into a fine thread is in england about per cent *  as an example of the cost of the different processes of a manufacture perhaps an analytical statement of the expense of the volume now in the reader's hands may not be uninteresting; more especially as it will afford an insight into the nature and extent of the taxes upon literature it is found economical to print it upon paper of a very large size so that although thirtytwo pages instead of sixteen are really contained in each sheet this work is still called octavo       l s d  to printer for composing per sheet of pages l s  sheets  this relates to the ordinary size of the type used in the volume  to printer for composing small type as in extracts and  contents extra per sheet s d  to printer for composing table work extra per sheet  s d average charge for corrections per sheet l s d press work being printed off per sheet l s paper for at l s d per ream weighing lbs the duty on paper at d per lb amounts to s per ream so that the reams which are required for the work will cost  paper excise duty total expense of paper total expense of printing and paper steelplate for titlepage engraving on ditto head of bacon ditto letters total expense of titlepage printing titlepage at s per paper for ditto at s d per expenses of advertising sundries total expense in sheets cost of a single copy in sheets; being printed including the overplus extra boarding cost of each copy boarded*  this analysis requires some explanation the printer usually charges for composition by the sheet supposing the type to be all of one kind; and as this charge is regulated by the size of the letter on which the quantity in a sheet depends little dispute can arise after the price is agreed upon if there are but few extracts or other parts of the work which require to be printed in smaller type; or if there are many notes or several passages in greek or in other languages requiring a different type these are considered in the original contract and a small additional price per sheet allowed if there is a large portion of small type it is better to have a specific additional charge for it per sheet if any work with irregular lines and many figures and what the printers call rules occurs it is called table work and is charged at an advanced price per sheet examples of this are frequent in the present volume if the page consists entirely of figures as in mathematical tables which require very careful correction the charge for composition is usually doubled a few years ago i printed a table of logarithms on a largesized page which required great additional labour and care from the readers* in rendering the proofs correct and for which although new punches were not required several new types were prepared and for which stereotype plates were cast costing about l per sheet in this case l per sheet were charged although ordinary composition with the same sized letter in demy octavo could have been executed at thirtyeight shillings per sheet but as the expense was ascertained before commencing the work it gave rise to no difficulties  the charge for corrections and alterations is one which from the difficulty of measuring them gives rise to the greatest inconvenience and is as disagreeable to the publisher if he be the agent between the author and the printer and to the master printer or his foreman as it is to the author himself if the author study economy he should make the whole of his corrections in the manuscript and should copy it out fairly it will then be printed correctly and he will have little to pay for corrections but it is scarcely possible to judge of the effect of any passage correctly without having it set up in type; and there are few subjects upon which an author does not find he can add some details or explanation when he sees his views in print if therefore he wish to save his own labour in transcribing and to give the last polish to the language he must be content to accomplish these objects at an increased expense if the printer possess a sufficient stock of type it will contribute still more to the convenience of the author to have his whole work put up in what are technically called slips* and then to make all the corrections and to have as few revises as he can the present work was set up in slips but the corrections have been unusually large and the revises frequent  the press work or printing off is charged at a price agreed upon for each two hundred and fifty sheets; and any broken number is still considered as two hundred and fifty when a large edition is required the price for two hundred and fifty is reduced; thus in the present volume two hundred and fifty copies if printed alone would have been charged eleven shillings per sheet instead of s d the actual charge the principle of this mode of charging is good as it obviates all disputes; but it is to be regretted that the custom of charging the same price for any small number as for two hundred and fifty is so pertinaciously adhered to that the workmen will not agree to any other terms when only twenty or thirty copies are required or even when only three or four are wanted for the sake of some experiment perhaps if all numbers above fifty were charged as two hundred and fifty and all below as for half two hundred and fifty both parties would derive an advantage  the effect of the excise duty is to render the paper thin in order that it may weigh little; but this is counteracted by the desire of the author to make his book look as thick as possible in order that he may charge the public as much as he decently can; and so on that ground alone the duty is of no importance there is however another effect of this duty which both the public and the author feel; for they pay not merely the duty which is charged but also the profit on that duty which the papermaker requires for the use of additional capital; and also the profit to the publisher and bookseller on the increased price of the volume  the estimated charge for advertisements is in the present case about the usual allowance for such a volume; and as it is considered that advertisements in newspapers are the most effectual where the smallest pays a duty of s d nearly one half of the charge of advertising is a tax  it appears then that to an expenditure of l necessary to produce the present volume l are added in the shape of a direct tax whether the profits arising from such a mode of manufacturing will justify such a rate of taxation can only be estimated when the returns from the volume are considered a subject that will be discussed in a subsequent chapter* it is at present sufficient to observe that the tax on advertisements is an impolitic tax when contrasted with that upon paper and on other materials employed the object of all advertisements is by making known articles for sale to procure for them a better price if the sale is to be by auction; or a larger extent of sale if by retail dealers now the more any article is known the more quickly it is discovered whether it contributes to the comfort or advantage of the public; and the more quickly its consumption is assured if it be found valuable it would appear then that every tax on communicating information respecting articles which are the subjects of taxation in another shape is one which must reduce the amount that would have been raised had no impediment been placed in the way of making known to the public their qualities and their price notes  these facts are taken from crawford's indian archipelago  these charges refer to the edition prepared for the public and do not relate to the large paper copies in the hands of some of the author's friends  readers are persons employed to correct the press at the printing office  slips are long pieces of paper on which sufficient matter is printed to form when divided from two to four pages of text  chapter chapter  on the causes and consequences of large factories  on examining the analysis which has been given in chapter xix of the operations in the art of pinmaking it will be observed that ten individuals are employed in it and also that the time occupied in executing the several processes is very different in order however to render more simple the reasoning which follows it will be convenient to suppose that each of the seven processes there described requires an equal quantity of time this being supposed it is at once apparent that to conduct an establishment for pinmaking most profitably the number of persons employed must be a multiple of ten for if a person with small means has only sufficient capital to enable him to employ half that number of persons they cannot each of them constantly adhere to the execution of the same process; and if a manufacturer employs any number not a multiple of ten a similar result must ensue with respect to some portion of them the same reflection constantly presents itself on examining any wellarranged factory in that of mr mordan the patentee of the everpointed pencils one room is devoted to some of the processes by which steel pens are manufactured six flypresses are here constantly at work; in the first a sheet of thin steel is brought by the workman under the die which at each blow cuts out a flat piece of the metal having the form intended for the pen two other workmen are employed in placing these flat pieces under two other presses in which a steel chisel cuts the slit three other workmen occupy other presses in which the pieces so prepared receive their semicylindrical form the longer time required for adjusting the small pieces in the two latter operations renders them less rapid in execution than the first; so that two workmen are fully occupied in slitting and three in bending the flat pieces which one man can punch out of the sheet of steel if therefore it were necessary to enlarge this factory it is clear that twelve or eighteen presses would be worked with more economy than any number not a multiple of six the same reasoning extends to every manufacture which is conducted upon the principle of the division of labour and we arrive at this general conclusion when the number of processes into which it is most advantageous to divide it and the number of individuals to be employed in it are ascertained then all factories which do not employ a direct multiple of this latter number will produce the article at a greater cost this principle ought always to be kept in view in great establishments although it is quite impossible even with the best division of the labour to attend to it rigidly in practice the proportionate number of the persons who possess the greatest skill is of course to be first attended to that exact ratio which is more profitable for a factory employing a hundred workmen may not be quite the best where there are five hundred; and the arrangements of both may probably admit of variations without materially increasing the cost of their produce but it is quite certain that no individual nor in the case of pinmaking could any five individuals ever hope to compete with an extensive establishment hence arises one cause of the great size of manufacturing establishments which have increased with the progress of civilization other circumstances however contribute to the same end and arise also from the same cause the division of labour  the material out of which the manufactured article is produced must in the several stages of its progress be conveyed from one operator to the next in succession this can be done at least expense when they are all working in the same establishment if the weight of the material is considerable this reason acts with additional force; but even where it is light the danger arising from frequent removal may render it desirable to have all the processes carried on in the same building in the cutting and polishing of glass this is the case; whilst in the art of needlemaking several of the processes are carried on in the cottages of the workmen it is however clear that the latter plan which is attended with some advantages to the family of the workmen can be adopted only where there exists a sure and quick method of knowing that the work has been well done and that the whole of the materials given out have been really employed  the inducement to contrive machines for any process of manufacture increases with the demand for the article; and the introduction of machinery on the other hand tends to increase the quantity produced and to lead to the establishment of large factories an illustration of these principles may be found in the history of the manufacture of patent net the first machines for weaving this article were very expensive costing from a thousand to twelve or thirteen hundred pounds the possessor of one of these though it greatly increased the quantity he could produce was nevertheless unable when working eight hours a day to compete with the old methods this arose from the large capital invested in the machinery; but he quickly perceived that with the same expense of fixed capital and a small addition to his circulating capital he could work the machine during the whole twentyfour hours the profits thus realized soon induced other persons to direct their attention to the improvement of those machines; and the price was greatly reduced at the same time that the rapidity of production of the patent net was increased but if machines be kept working through the twentyfour hours it is necessary that some person shall attend to admit the workmen at the time they relieve each other; and whether the porter or other servant so employed admit one person or twenty his rest will be equally disturbed it will also be necessary occasionally to adjust or repair the machine; and this can be done much better by a workman accustomed to machinemaking than by the person who uses it now since the good performance and the duration of machines depend to a very great extent upon correcting every shake or imperfection in their parts as soon as they appear the prompt attention of a workman resident on the spot will considerably reduce the expenditure arising from the wear and tear of the machinery but in the case of single lace frame or a single loom this would be too expensive a plan here then arises another circumstance which tends to enlarge the extent of a factory it ought to consist of such a number of machines as shall occupy the whole time of one workman in keeping them in order if extended beyond that number the same principle of economy would point out the necessity of doubling or tripling the number of machines in order to employ the whole time of two or three skilful workmen  where one portion of the workman's labour consists in the exertion of mere physical force as in weaving and in many similar arts it will soon occur to the manufacturer that if that part were executed by a steamengine the same man might in the case of weaving attend to two or more looms at once; and since we already suppose that one or more operative engineers have been employed the number of his looms may be so arranged that their time shall be fully occupied in keeping the steamengine and the looms in order one of the first results will be that the looms can be driven by the engine nearly twice as fast as before and as each man when relieved from bodily labour can attend to two looms one workman can now make almost as much cloth as four this increase of producing power is however greater than that which really took place at first; the velocity of some of the parts of the loom being limited by the strength of the thread and the quickness with which it commences its motion but an improvement was soon made by which the motion commenced slowly and gradually acquired greater velocity than it was safe to give it at once; and the speed was thus increased from to about strokes per minute  pursuing the same principles the manufactory becomes gradually so enlarged that the expense of lighting during the night amounts to a considerable sum; and as there are already attached to the establishment persons who are up all night and can therefore constantly attend to it and also engineers to make and keep in repair any machinery the addition of an apparatus for making gas to light the factory leads to a new extension at the same time that it contributes by diminishing the expense of lighting and the risk of accidents from fire to reduce the cost of manufacturing  long before a factory has reached this extent it will have been found necessary to establish an accountant's department with clerks to pay the workmen and to see that they arrive at their stated times; and this department must be in communication with the agents who purchase the raw produce and with those who sell the manufactured article  we have seen that the application of the division of labour tends to produce cheaper articles; that it thus increases the demand; and gradually by the effect of competition or by the hope of increased gain that it causes large capitals to be embarked in extensive factories let us now examine the influence of this accumulation of capital directed to one object in the first place it enables the most important principle on which the advantages of the division of labour depends to be carried almost to its extreme limits not merely is the precise amount of skill purchased which is necessary for the execution of each process but throughout every stagefrom that in which the raw material is procured to that by which the finished produce is conveyed into the hands of the consumerthe same economy of skill prevails the quantity of work produced by a given number of people is greatly augmented by such an extended arrangement; and the result is necessarily a great reduction in the cost of the article which is brought to market  amongst the causes which tend to the cheap production of any article and which are connected with the employment of additional capital may be mentioned the care which is taken to prevent the absolute waste of any part of the raw material an attention to this circumstance sometimes causes the union of two trades in one factory which otherwise might have been separated an enumeration of the arts to which the horns of cattle are applicable will furnish a striking example of this kind of economy the tanner who has purchased the raw hides separates the horns and sells them to the makers of combs and lanterns the horn consists of two parts an outward horny case and an inward conical substance somewhat intermediate between indurated hair and bone the first process consists in separating these two parts by means of a blow against a block of wood the horny exterior is then cut into three portions with a framesaw  the lowest of these next the root of the horn after undergoing several processes by which it is flattened is made into combs  the middle of the horn after being flattened by heat and having its transparency improved by oil is split into thin layers and forms a substitute for glass in lanterns of the commonest kind  the tip of the horn is used by the makers of knife handles and of the tops of whips and for other similar purposes  the interior or core of the horn is boiled down in water a large quantity of fat rises to the surface; this is put aside and sold to the makers of yellow soap  the liquid itself is used as a kind of glue and is purchased by cloth dressers for stiffening  the insoluble substance which remains behind is then sent to the mill and being ground down is sold to the farmers for manure  besides these various purposes to which the different parts of the horn are applied the clippings which arise in comb making are sold to the farmer for manure in the first year after they are spread over the soil they have comparatively little effect but during the next four or five their efficiency is considerable the shavings which form the refuse of the lantern maker are of a much thinner texture some of them are cut into various figures and painted and used as toys; for being hygrometric they curl up when placed on the palm of a warm hand but the greater part of these shavings also are sold for manure and from their extremely thin and divided form the full effect is produced upon the first crop  another event which has arisen in one trade at least from the employment of large capital is that a class of middlemen formerly interposed between the maker and the merchant now no longer exist when calico was woven in the cottages of the workmen there existed a class of persons who travelled about and purchased the pieces so made in large numbers for the purpose of selling them to the exporting merchant but the middlemen were obliged to examine every piece in order to know that it was perfect and of full measure the greater number of the workmen it is true might be depended upon but the fraud of a few would render this examination indispensable for any single cottager though detected by one purchaser might still hope that the fact would not become known to all the rest the value of character though great in all circumstances of life can never be so fully experienced by persons possessed of small capital as by those employing much larger sums whilst these larger sums of money for which the merchant deals render his character for punctuality more studied and known by others thus it happens that high character supplies the place of an additional portion of capital; and the merchant in dealing with the great manufacturer is saved from the expense of verification by knowing that the loss or even the impeachment of the manufacturer's character would be attended with greater injury to himself than any profit upon a single transaction could compensate  the amount of wellgrounded confidence which exists in the character of its merchants and manufacturers is one of the many advantages that an old manufacturing country always possesses over its rivals to such an extent is this confidence in character carried in england that at one of our largest towns sales and purchases on a very extensive scale are made daily in the course of business without any of the parties ever exchanging a written document  a breach of confidence of this kind which might have been attended with very serious embarrassment occurred in the recent expedition to the mouth of the niger 'we brought with us from england' mr lander states 'nearly a hundred thousand needles of various sizes and amongst them was a great quantity of whitechapel sharps warranted superfine and not to cut in the eye thus highly recommended we imagined that these needles must have been excellent indeed; but what was our surprise some time ago when a number of them which we had disposed of were returned to us with a complaint that they were all eyeless thus redeeming with a vengeance the pledge of the manufacturer that they would not cut in the eye on examination afterwards we found the same fault with the remainder of the whitechapel sharps so that to save our credit we have been obliged to throw them away'*  the influence of established character in producing confidence operated in a very remarkable manner at the time of the exclusion of british manufactures from the continent during the last war one of our largest establishments had been in the habit of doing extensive business with a house in the centre of germany; but on the closing of the continental ports against our manufactures heavy penalties were inflicted on all those who contravened the berlin and milan decrees the english manufacturer continued nevertheless to receive orders with directions how to consign them and appointments for the time and mode of payment in letters the handwriting of which was known to him but which were never signed except by the christian name of one of the firm and even in some instances they were without any signature at all these orders were executed; and in no instance was there the least irregularity in the payments  another circumstance may be noticed which to a small extent is more advantageous to large than to small factories in the export of several articles of manufacture a drawback is allowed by government of a portion of the duty paid on the importation of the raw material in such circumstances certain forms must be gone through in order to protect the revenue from fraud; and a clerk or one of the partners must attend at the customhouse the agent of the large establishment occupies nearly the same time in receiving a drawback of several thousands as the smaller exporter does of a few shillings but if the quantity exported is inconsiderable the small manufacturer frequently does not find the drawback will repay him for the loss of time  in many of the large establishments of our manufacturing districts substances are employed which are the produce of remote countries and which are in several instances almost peculiar to a few situations the discovery of any new locality where such articles exist in abundance is a matter of great importance to any establishment which consumes them in large quantities; and it has been found in some instances that the expense of sending persons to great distances purposely to discover and to collect such produce has been amply repaid thus it has happened that the snowy mountains of sweden and norway as well as the warmer hills of corsica have been almost stripped of one of their vegetable productions by agents sent expressly from one of our largest establishments for the dying of calicos owing to the same command of capital and to the scale upon which the operations of large factories are carried on their returns admit of the expense of sending out agents to examine into the wants and tastes of distant countries as well as of trying experiments which although profitable to them would be ruinous to smaller establishments possessing more limited resources these opinions have been so well expressed in the report of the committee of the house of commons on the woollen trade in that we shall close this chapter with an extract in which the advantages of great factories are summed up your committee have the satisfaction of seeing that the apprehensions entertained of factories are not only vicious in principle but they are practically erroneous to such a degree that even the very opposite principles might be reasonably entertained nor would it be difficult to prove that the factories to a certain extent at least and in the present day seem absolutely necessary to the wellbeing of the domestic system supplying those very particulars wherein the domestic system must be acknowledged to be inherently defective for it is obvious that the little master manufacturers cannot afford like the man who possesses considerable capital to try the experiments which are requisite and incur the risks and even losses which almost always occur in inventing and perfecting new articles of manufacture or in carrying to a state of greater perfection articles already established he cannot learn by personal inspection the wants and habits the arts manufactures and improvements of foreign countries; diligence economy and prudence are the requisites of his character not invention taste and enterprise nor would he be warranted in hazarding the loss of any part of his small capital he walks in a sure road as long as he treads in the beaten track; but he must not deviate into the paths of speculation the owner of a factory on the contrary being commonly possessed of a large capital and having all his workmen employed under his own immediate superintendence may make experiments hazard speculation invent shorter or better modes of performing old processes may introduce new articles and improve and perfect old ones thus giving the range to his taste and fancy and thereby alone enabling our manufacturers to stand the competition with their commercial rivals in other countries meanwhile as is well worthy of remark and experience abundantly warrants the assertion many of these new fabrics and inventions when their success is once established become general amongst the whole body of manufacturers the domestic manufacturers themselves thus benefiting in the end from those very factories which had been at first the objects of their jealousy the history of almost all our other manufactures in which great improvements have been made of late years in some cases at an immense expense and after numbers of unsuccessful experiments strikingly illustrates and enforces the above remarks it is besides an acknowledged fact that the owners of factories are often amongst the most extensive purchasers at the halls where they buy from the domestic clothier the established articles of manufacture or are able at once to answer a great and sudden order; whilst at home and under their own superintendence they make their fancy goods and any articles of a newer more costly or more delicate quality to which they are enabled by the domestic system to apply a much larger proportion of their capital thus the two systems instead of rivalling are mutual aids to each other each supplying the other's defects and promoting the other's prosperity notes  lander's journal of an expedition to the mouth of the niger vol ii p chapter  on the position of large factories  it is found in every country that the situation of large manufacturing establishments is confined to particular districts in the earlier history of a manufacturing community before cheap modes of transport have been extensively introduced it will almost always be found that manufactories are placed near those spots in which nature has produced the raw material especially in the case of articles of great weight and in those the value of which depends more upon the material than upon the labour expended on it most of the metallic ores being exceedingly heavy and being mixed up with large quantities of weighty and useless materials must be smelted at no great distance from the spot which affords them fuel and power are the requisites for reducing them; and any considerable fall of water in the vicinity will naturally be resorted to for aid in the coarser exertions of physical force; for pounding the ore for blowing the furnaces or for hammering and rolling out the iron there are indeed peculiar circumstances which will modify this iron coal and limestone commonly occur in the same tracts; but the union of the fuel in the same locality with the ore does not exist with respect to other metals the tracts generally the most productive of metallic ores are geologically speaking different from those affording coal thus in cornwall there are veins of copper and of tin but no beds of coal the copper ore which requires a very large quantity of fuel for its reduction is sent by sea to the coalfields of wales and is smelted at swansea; whilst the vessels which convey it take back coals to work the steamengines for draining the mines and to smelt the tin which requires for that purpose a much smaller quantity of fuel than copper  rivers passing through districts rich in coal and metals will form the first highroads for the conveyance of weighty produce to stations in which other conveniences present themselves for the further application of human skill canals will succeed or lend their aid to these; and the yet unexhausted applications of steam and of gas hold out a hope of attaining almost the same advantages for countries to which nature seemed for ever to have denied them manufactures commerce and civilization always follow the line of new and cheap communications twenty years ago the mississippi poured the vast volume of its waters in lavish profusion through thousands of miles of countries which scarcely supported a few wandering and uncivilized tribes of indians the power of the stream seemed to set at defiance the efforts of man to ascend its course; and as if to render the task still more hopeless large trees torn from the surrounding forests were planted like stakes in its bottom forming in some places barriers in others the nucleus of banks; and accumulating in the same spot which but for accident would have been free from both the difficulties and dangers of shoals and of rocks four months of incessant toil could scarcely convey a small bark with its wornout crew two thousand miles up this stream the same voyage is now performed in fifteen days by large vessels impelled by steam carrying hundreds of passengers enjoying all the comforts and luxuries of civilized life instead of the hut of the indian and the far more unfrequent log house of the thinly scattered settlersvillages towns and cities have arisen on its banks; and the same engine which stems the force of these powerful waters will probably tear from their bottom the obstructions which have hitherto impeded and rendered dangerous their navigation*  the accumulation of many large manufacturing establishments in the same district has a tendency to bring together purchasers or their agents from great distances and thus to cause the institution of a public mart or exchange this contributes to diffuse information relative to the supply of raw materials and the state of demand for their produce with which it is necessary manufacturers should be well acquainted the very circumstance of collecting periodically at one place a large number both of those who supply the market and of those who require its produce tends strongly to check the accidental fluctuations to which a small market is always subject as well as to render the average of the prices much more uniform  when capital has been invested in machinery and in buildings for its accommodation and when the inhabitants of the neighbourhood have acquired a knowledge of the modes of working at the machines reasons of considerable weight are required to cause their removal such changes of position do however occur; and they have been alluded to by the committee on the fluctuation of manufacturers' employment as one of the causes interfering most materially with an uniform rate of wages it is therefore of particular importance to the workmen to be acquainted with the real causes which have driven manufactures from their ancient seats the migration or change of place of any manufacture has sometimes arisen from improvements of machinery not applicable to the spot where such manufacture was carried on as appears to have been the case with the woollen manufacture which has in great measure migrated from essex suffolk and other southern counties to the northern districts where coal for the use of the steamengine is much cheaper but this change has in some instances been caused or accelerated by the conduct of the workmen in refusing a reasonable reduction of wages or opposing the introduction of some kind of improved machinery or process; so that during the dispute another spot has in great measure supplied their place in the market any violence used by the workmen against the property of their masters and any unreasonable combination on their part is almost sure thus to be injurious to themselves  these removals become of serious consequence when the factories have been long established because a population commensurate with their wants invariably grows up around them the combinations in nottinghamshire of persons under the name of luddites drove a great number of lace frames from that district and caused establishments to be formed in devonshire we ought also to observe that the effect of driving any establishment into a new district where similar works have not previously existed is not merely to place it out of the reach of such combinations; but after a few years the example of its success will most probably induce other capitalists in the new district to engage in the same manufacture and thus although one establishment only should be driven away the workmen through whose combination its removal is effected will not merely suffer by the loss of that portion of demand for their labour which the factory caused; but the value of that labour will itself be reduced by the competition of a new field of production  another circumstance which has its influence on this question is the nature of the machinery heavy machinery such as stampingmills steamengines etc cannot readily be moved and must always be taken to pieces for that purpose; but when the machinery of a factory consists of a multitude of separate engines each complete in itself and all put in motion by one source of power such as that of steam then the removal is much less inconvenient thus stocking frames lace machines and looms can be transported to more favourable positions with but a small separation of their parts  it is of great importance that the more intelligent amongst the class of workmen should examine into the correctness of these views; because without having their attention directed to them the whole class may in some instances be led by designing persons to pursue a course which although plausible in appearance is in reality at variance with their own best interests i confess i am not without a hope that this volume may fall into the hands of workmen perhaps better qualified than myself to reason upon a subject which requires only plain common sense and whose powers are sharpened by its importance to their personal happiness in asking their attention to the preceding remarks and to those which i shall offer respecting combinations i can claim only one advantage over them; namely that i never have had and in all human probability never shall have the slightest pecuniary interest to influence even remotely or by anticipation the judgements i have formed on the facts which have come before me notes  the amount of obstructions arising from the casual fixing of trees in the bottom of the river may be estimated from the proportion of steamboats destroyed by running upon them the subjoined statement is taken from the american almanack for  between the years and three hundred and fortyeight steamboats were built on the mississippi and its tributary streams during that period a hundred and fifty were lost or worn out of this hundred and fifty worn out       lost by snags      burnt        lost by collision     by accidents not ascertained thirty six or nearly one fourth being destroyed by accidental obstruction snag is the name given in america to trees which stand nearly upright in the stream with their roots fixed at the bottom it is usual to divide off at the bow of the steamboats a watertight chamber in order that when a hole is made in it by running against the snags the water may not enterthe rest of the vessel and sink it intantly  chapter  on over manufacturing  one of the natural and almost inevitable consequences of competition is the production of a supply much larger than the demand requires this result usually arises periodically; and it is equally important both to the masters and to the workmen to prevent its occurrence or to foresee its arrival in situations where a great number of very small capitalists existwhere each master works himself and is assisted by his own family or by a few journeymenand where a variety of different articles is produced a curious system of compensation has arisen which in some measure diminishes the extent to which fluctuations of wages would otherwise reach this is accomplished by a species of middlemen or factors persons possessing some capital who whenever the price of any of the articles in which they deal is greatly reduced purchase it on their own account in the hopes of selling at a profit when the market is better these persons in ordinary times act as salesmen or agents and make up assortments of goods at the market price for the use of the home or foreign dealer they possess large warehouses in which to make up their orders or keep in store articles purchased during periods of depression; thus acting as a kind of flywheel in equalizing the market price  the effect of overmanufacturing upon great establishments is different when an over supply has reduced prices one of two events usually occurs the first is a diminished payment for labour; the other is a diminution of the number of hours during which the labourers work together with a diminished rate of wages in the former case production continues to go on at its ordinary rate in the latter the production itself being checked the supply again adjusts itself to the demand as soon as the stock on hand is worked off and prices then regain their former level the latter course appears in the first instance to be the best both for masters and men; but there seems to be a difficulty in accomplishing this except where the trade is in few hands in fact it is almost necessary for its success that there should be a combination amongst the masters or amongst the men; or what is always far preferable to either a mutual agreement for their joint interests combination amongst the men is difficult and is always attended with the evils which arise from the illwill excited against any persons who in the perfectly justifiable exercise of their judgement are disposed not to act with the majority the combination of the masters on the other hand is unavailing unless the whole body of them agree for if any one master can procure more labour for his money than the rest he will be able to undersell them  if we look only at the interests of the consumer the case is different when too large a supply has produced a great reduction of price it opens the consumption of the article to a new class and increases the consumption of those who previously employed it it is therefore against the interest of both these parties that a return to the former price should occur it is also certain that by the diminution of profit which the manufacturer suffers from the diminished price his ingenuity will be additionally stimulated; that he will apply himself to discover other and cheaper sources for the supply of his raw material; that he will endeavour to contrive improved machinery which shall manufacture it at a cheaper rate; or try to introduce new arrangements into his factory which shall render the economy of it more perfect in the event of his success by any of these courses or by their joint effects a real and substantial good will be produced a larger portion of the public will receive advantage from the use of the article and they will procure it at a lower price; and the manufacturer though his profit on each operation is reduced will yet by the more frequent returns on the larger produce of his factory find his real gain at the end of the year nearly the same as it was before; whilst the wages of the workman will return to their level and both the manufacturer and the workman will find the demand less fluctuating from its being dependent on a larger number of customers  it would be highly interesting if we could trace even approximately through the history of any great manufacture the effects of gluts in producing improvements in machinery or in methods of working; and if we could shew what addition to the annual quantity of goods previously manufactured was produced by each alteration it would probably be found that the increased quantity manufactured by the same capital when worked with the new improvement would produce nearly the same rate of profit as other modes of investment perhaps the manufacture of iron* would furnish the best illustration of this subject; because by having the actual price of pig and bar iron at the same place and at the same time the effect of a change in the value of currency as well as several other sources of irregularity would be removed  at the present moment whilst the manufacturers of iron are complaining of the ruinously low price of their produce a new mode of smelting iron is coming into use which if it realizes the statement of the patentees promises to reduce greatly the cost of production the improvement consists in heating the air previously to employing it for blowing the furnace one of the results is that coal may be used instead of coke; and this in its turn diminishes the quantity of limestone which is required for the fusion of the iron stone the following statement by the proprietors of the patent is extracted from brewster's journal p  comparative view of the quantity of materials required at the clyde iron works to smelt a ton of foundry pigiron and of the quantity of foundry pigiron smelted from each furnace weekly fuel in tons of cwt each cwt lbs; ironstone; limestone cwt; weekly produce in pigiron tons  with air not heated and coke; ; ; ;  with air heated and coke; ; ; ;  with air heated and coals not coked; ; ; ;  notes to the coals stated in the second and third lines must be added cwt of small coals required to heat the air  the expense of the apparatus for applying the heated air will be from l to l per furnace  no coals are now coked at the clyde iron works; at all the three furnaces the iron is smelted with coals  the three furnaces are blown by a doublepowered steamengine with a steam cylinder inches in diameter and a blowing cylinder inches in diameter which compresses the air so as to carry  lbs per square inch there are two tuyeres to each furnace the muzzles of the blowpipes are inches in diameter  the air heated to upwards of degrees of fahrenheit it will melt lead at the distance of three inches from the orifice through which it issues from the pipe  the increased effect produced by thus heating the air is by no means an obvious result; and an analysis of its action will lead to some curious views respecting the future application of machinery for blowing furnaces every cubic foot of atmospheric air driven into a furnace consists of two gases* about onefifth being oxygen and fourfifths azote according to the present state of chemical knowledge the oxygen alone is effective in producing heat; and the operation of blowing a furnace may be thus analysed  the air is forced into the furnace in a condensed state and immediately expanding abstracts heat from the surrounding bodies  being itself of moderate temperature it would even without expansion still require heat to raise it to the temperature of the hot substances to which it is to be applied  on coming into contact with the ignited substances in the furnace the oxygen unites with them parting at the same moment with a large portion of its latent heat and forming compounds which have less specific heat than their separate constituents some of these pass up the chimney in a gaseous state whilst others remain in the form of melted slags floating on the surface of the iron which is fused by the heat thus set at liberty  the effects of the azote are precisely similar to the first and second of those above described; it seems to form no combinations and contributes nothing in any stage to augment the heat the plan therefore of heating the air before driving it into the furnace saves obviously the whole of that heat which the fuel must have supplied in raising it from the temperature of the external air up to that of degrees fahrenheit; thus rendering the fire more intense and the glassy slags more fusible and perhaps also more effectually decomposing the iron ore the same quantity of fuel applied at once to the furnace would only prolong the duration of its heat not augment its intensity  the circumstance of so large a portion of the air* driven into furnaces being not merely useless but acting really as a cooling instead of a heating cause added to so great a waste of mechanical power in condensing it amounting in fact to fourfifths of the whole clearly shews the defects of the present method and the want of some better mode of exciting combustion on a large scale the following suggestions are thrown out as likely to lead to valuable results even though they should prove ineffectual for their professed object  the great difficulty appears to be to separate the oxygen which aids combustion from the azote which impedes it if either of those gases becomes liquid at a lower pressure than the other and if those pressures are within the limits of our present powers of compression the object might be accomplished let us assume for example that oxygen becomes liquid under a pressure of atmospheres whilst azote requires a pressure of then if atmospheric air be condensed to the two hundredth part of its bulk the oxygen will be found in a liquid state at the bottom of the vessel in which the condensation is effected and the upper part of the vessel will contain only azote in the state of gas the oxygen now liquefied may be drawn off for the supply of the furnace; but as it ought when used to have a very moderate degree of condensation its expansive force may be previously employed in working a small engine the compressed azote also in the upper part of the vessel though useless for combustion may be employed as a source of power and by its expansion work another engine by these means the mechanical force exerted in the original compression would all be restored except that small part retained for forcing the pure oxygen into the furnace and the much larger part lost in the friction of the apparatus  the principal difficulty to be apprehended in these operations is that of packing a working piston so as to bear the pressure of or atmospheres but this does not seem insurmountable it is possible also that the chemical combination of the two gases which constitute common air may be effected by such pressures if this should be the case it might offer a new mode of manufacturing nitrous or nitric acids the result of such experiments might take another direction if the condensation were performed over liquids it is possible that they might enter into new chemical combinations thus if air were highly condensed in a vessel containing water the latter might unite with an additional dose of oxygen * which might afterwards be easily disengaged for the use of the furnace  a further cause of the uncertainty of the results of such an experiment arises from the possibility that azote may really contribute to the fusion of the mixed mass in the furnace though its mode of operating is at present unknown an examination of the nature of the gases issuing from the chimneys of ironfoundries might perhaps assist in clearing up this point; and in fact if such enquiries were also instituted upon the various products of all furnaces we might expect the elucidation of many points in the economy of the metallurgic art  it is very possible also that the action of oxygen in a liquid state might be exceedingly corrosive and that the containing vessels must be lined with platinum or some other substance of very difficult oxydation; and most probably new and unexpected compounds would be formed at such pressures in some experiments made by count rumford in on the force of fired gunpowder he noticed a solid compound which always appeared in the gunbarrel when the ignited powder had no means of escaping; and in those cases the gas which escaped on removing the restraining pressure was usually inconsiderable  if the liquefied gases are used the form of the iron furnace must probably be changed and perhaps it may be necessary to direct the flame from the ignited fuel upon the ore to be fused instead of mixing that ore with the fuel itself by a proper regulation of the blast an oxygenating or a deoxygenating flame might be procured; and from the intensity of the flame combined with its chemical agency we might expect the most refractory ore to be smelted and that ultimately the metals at present almost infusible such as platinum titanium and others might be brought into common use and thus effect a revolution in the arts  supposing on the occurrence of a glut that new and cheaper modes of producing are not discovered and that the production continues to exceed the demand then it is apparent that too much capital is employed in the trade; and after a time the diminished rate of profit will drive some of the manufacturers to other occupations what particular individuals will leave it must depend on a variety of circumstances superior industry and attention will enable some factories to make a profit rather beyond the rest; superior capital in others will enable them without these advantages to support competition longer even at a loss with the hope of driving the smaller capitalists out of the market and then reimbursing themselves by an advanced price it is however better for all parties that this contest should not last long; and it is important that no artificial restraint should interfere to prevent it an instance of such restriction and of its injurious effect occurs at the port of newcastle where a particular act of parliament requires that every ship shall be loaded in its turn the committee of the house of commons in their report on the coal trade state that  'under the regulations contained in this act if more ships enter into the trade than can be profitablv employed in it the loss produced by detention in port and waiting for a cargo which must consequently take place instead of falling as it naturally would upon particular ships and forcing them from the trade is now divided evenly amongst them; and the loss thus created is shared by the whole number' report p it is not pretended in this short view to trace out all the effects or remedies of overmanufacturing; the subject is difficult and unlike some of the questions already treated requires a combined view of the relative influence of many concurring causes notes  the average price per ton of pig iron bar iron and coal together with the price paid for labour at the works for a long series of years would be very valuable and i shall feel much indebted to anyone who will favour me with it for any even short period  the accurate proportions are by measure oxygen azote  a similar reasoning may be applied to lamps an argand burner whether used for consuming oil or gas admits almost an unlimited quantity of air it would deserve enquiry whether a smaller quantity might not produce greater light; and possibly a different supply furnish more heat with the same expenditure of fuel  deutoxide of hydrogen the oxygenated water of thenard  chapter  enquiries previous to commencing any manufactory  there are many enquiries which ought always to be made previous to the commencement of the manufacture of any new article these chiefly relate to the expense of tools machinery raw materials and all the outgoings necessary for its production; to the extent of demand which is likely to arise; to the time in which the circulating capital will be replaced; and to the quickness or slowness with which the new article will supersede those already in use  the expense of tools and of new machines will be more difficult to ascertain in proportion as they differ from those already employed; but the variety in constant use in our various manufactories is such that few inventions now occur in which considerable resemblance may not be traced to others already constructed the cost of the raw material is usually less difficult to determine; but cases occasionally arise in which it becomes important to examine whether the supply at the given price can be depended upon for in the case of a small consumption the additional demand arising from a factory may produce a considerable temporary rise though it may ultimately reduce the price  the quantity of any new article likely to be consumed is a most important subject for the consideration of the projector of a new manufacture as these pages are not intended for the instruction of the manufacturer but rather for the purpose of giving a general view of the subject an illustration of the way in which such questions are regarded by practical men will perhaps be most instructive the following extract from the evidence given before a committee of the house of commons in the report on artizans and machinery shews the extent to which articles apparently the most insignificant are consumed and the view which the manufacturer takes of them the person examined on this occasion was mr ostler a manufacturer of glass beads and other toys of the same substance from birmingham several of the articles made by him were placed upon the table for the inspection of the committee of the house of commons which held its meetings in one of the committeerooms question is there any thing else you have to state upon this subject? answer gentlemen may consider the articles on the table as extremely insignificant but perhaps i may surprise them a little by mentioning the following fact eighteen years ago on my first journey to london a respectablelooking man in the city asked me if i could supply him with dolls' eyes; and i was foolish enough to feel half offended; i thought it derogatory to my new dignity as a manufacturer to make dolls' eyes he took me into a room quite as wide and perhaps twice the length of this and we had just room to walk between stacks from the loor to the ceiling of parts of dolls he said 'these are only the legs and arms; the trunks are below but i saw enough to convince me that he wanted a great many eyes; and as the article appeared quite in my own line of business i said i would take an order by way of experiment; and he shewed me several specimens i copied the order he ordered various quantities and of various sizes and qualities on returning to the tavistock hotel i found that the order amounted to upwards of l i went into the country and endeavoured to make them i had some of the most ingenious glass toymakers in the kingdom in my service; but when i shewed it to them they shook their heads and said they had often seen the article before but could not make it i engaged them by presents to use their best exertions; but after trying and wasting a great deal of time for three or four weeks i was obliged to relinquish the attempt soon afterwards i engaged in another branch of business chandelier furniture and took no more notice of it about eighteen months ago i resumed the trinket trade and then determined to think of the dolls' eyes; and about eight months since i accidentally met with a poor fellow who had impoverished himself by drinking and who was dying in a consumption in a state of great want i showed him ten sovereigns and he said he would instruct me in the process he was in such a state that he could not bear the effluvia of his own lamp but though i was very conversant with the manual part of the business and it related to things i was daily in the habit of seeing i felt i could do nothing from his description i mention this to show how difficult it is to convey by description the mode of working he took me into his garret where the poor fellow had economized to such a degree that he actually used the entrails and fat of poultry from leadenhall market to save oil the price of the article having been lately so much reduced by competition at home in an instant before i had seen him make three i felt competent to make a gross; and the difference between his mode and that of my own workmen was so trifling that i felt the utmost astonishment question you can now make dolls' eyes? answer i can as it was eighteen years ago that i received the order i have mentioned and feeling doubtful of my own recollection though very strong and suspecting that it could not have been to the amount stated i last night took the present very reduced price of that article less than half now of what it was then and calculating that every child in this country not using a doll till two years old and throwing it aside at seven and having a new one annually i satisfied myself that the eyes alone would produce a circulation of a great many thousand pounds i mention this merely to shew the importance of trifles; and to assign one reason amongst many for my conviction that nothing but personal communication can enable our manufactures to be transplanted  in many instances it is exceedingly difficult to estimate beforehand the sale of an article or the effects of a machine; a case however occurred during a recent enquiry which although not quite appropriate as an illustration of probable demand is highly instructive as to the mode of conducting investigations of this nature a committee of the house of commons was appointed to enquire into the tolls proper to be placed on steamcarriages; a question apparently of difficult solution and upon which widely different opinions had been formed if we may judge by the very different rate of tolls imposed upon such carriages by different 'turnpike trusts' the principles on which the committee conducted the enquiry were that 'the only ground on which a fair claim to toll can be made on any public road is to raise a fund which with the strictest economy shall be just sufficientfirst to repay the expense of its original formation; secondly to maintain it in good and sufficient repair' they first endeavoured to ascertain from competent persons the effect of the atmosphere alone in deteriorating a wellconstructed road the next step was to determine the proportion in which the road was injured by the effect of the horses' feet compared with that of the wheels mr macneill the superintendent under mr telford of the holyhead roads was examined and proposed to estimate the relative injury from the comparative quantities of iron worn off from the shoes of the horses and from the tire of the wheels from the data he possessed respecting the consumption of iron for the tire of the wheels and for the shoes of the horses of one of the birmingham daycoaches he estimated the wear and tear of roads arising from the feet of the horses to be three times as great as that arising from the wheels supposing repairs amounting to a hundred pounds to be required on a road travelled over by a fast coach at the rate of ten miles an hour and the same amount of injury to occur on another road used only by waggons moving at the rate of three miles an hour mr macneill divides the injuries in the following proportions  injuries arising from; fast coach; heavy waggon atmospheric changes    wheels       horses' feet drawing    total injury     supposing it therefore to be ascertained that the wheels of steam carriages do no more injury to roads than other carriages of equal weight travelling with the same velocity the committee now possessed the means of approximating to a just rate of toll for steam carriages*  as connected with this subject and as affording most valuable information upon points in which previous to experiment widely different opinions have been entertained; the following extract is inserted from mr telford's report on the state of the holyhead and liverpool roads the instrument employed for the comparison was invented by mr macneill; and the road between london and shrewsbury was selected for the place of experiment the general results when a waggon weighing cwt was used on different sorts of roads are as follows       lbs on wellmade pavement the draught is  on a broken stone surface or old flint road  on a gravel road  on a broken stone road upon a rough pavement foundation  on a broken stone surface upon a bottoming of concrete formed of parker's cement and gravel  the following statement relates to the force required to draw a coach weighing cwt exclusive of seven passengers up roads of various inclinations inclination; force required at six miles per hour; force at eight miles per hour; force at ten miles per hour   lbs lbs lbs  in   in   in   in   in   in establishing a new manufactory the time in which the goods produced can be brought to market and the returns be realized should be thoroughly considered as well as the time the new article will take to supersede those already in use if it is destroyed in using the new produce will be much more easily introduced steel pens readily took the place of quills; and a new form of pen would if it possessed any advantage as easily supersede the present one a new lock however secure and however cheap would not so readily make its way if less expensive than the old it would be employed in new work but old locks would rarely be removed to make way for it; and even if perfectly secure its advance would be slow  another element in this question which should not be altogether omitted is the opposition which the new manufacture may create by its real or apparent injury to other interests and the probable effect of that opposition this is not always foreseen; and when anticipated is often inaccurately estimated on the first establishment of steamboats from london to margate the proprietors of the coaches running on that line of road petitioned the house of commons against them as likely to lead to the ruin of the coach proprietors it was however found that the fear was imaginary; and in a very few years the number of coaches on that road was considerably increased apparently through the very means which were thought to be adverse to it the fear which is now entertained that steampower and railroads may drive out of employment a large proportion of the horses at present in use is probably not less unfounded on some particular lines such an effect might be produced; but in all probability the number of horses employed in conveying goods and passengers to the great lines of railroad would exceed that which is at present used notes  one of the results of these enquiries is that every coach which travels from london to birmingham distributes about eleven pounds of wrought iron along with the line of road between the two places  chapter  on a new system of manufacturing  a most erroneous and unfortunate opinion prevails amongst workmen in many manufacturing countries that their own interest and that of their employers are at variance the consequences are that valuable machinery is sometimes neglected and even privately injuredthat new improvements introduced by the masters do not receive a fair trialand that the talents and observations of the workmen are not directed to the improvement of the processes in which they are employed this error is perhaps most prevalent where the establishment of manufactories has been of recent origin and where the number of persons employed in them is not very large thus in some of the prussian provinces on the rhine it prevails to a much greater extent than in lancashire perhaps its diminished prevalence in our own manufacturing districts arises partly from the superior information spread amongst the workmen; and partly from the frequent example of persons who by good conduct and an attention to the interests of their employers for a series of years have become foremen or who have ultimately been admitted into advantageous partnerships convinced as i am from my own observation that the prosperity and success of the master manufacturer is essential to the welfare of the workman i am yet compelled to admit that this connection is in many cases too remote to be always understood by the latter and whilst it is perfectly true that workmen as a class derive advantage from the prosperity of their employers i do not think that each individual partakes of that advantage exactly in proportion to the extent to which he contributes towards it; nor do i perceive that the resulting advantage is as immediate as it might become under a different system  it would be of great importance if in every large establishment the mode of payment could be so arranged that every person employed should derive advantage from the success of the whole; and that the profits of each individual should advance as the factory itself produced profit without the necessity of making any change in the wages this is by no means easy to effect particularly amongst that class whose daily labour procures for them their daily food the system which has long been pursued in working the cornish mines although not exactly fulfilling these conditions yet possesses advantages which make it worthy of attention as having nearly approached towards them and as tending to render fully effective the faculties of all who are engaged in it i am the more strongly induced to place before the reader a short sketch of this system because its similarity to that which i shall afterwards recommend for trial will perhaps remove some objections to the latter and may also furnish some valuable hints for conducting any experiment which might be undertaken  in the mines of cornwall almost the whole of the operations both above and below ground are contracted for the manner of making the contract is nearly as follows at the end of every two months the work which it is proposed to carry on during the next period is marked out it is of three kinds tutwork which consists in sinking shafts driving levels and making excavations this is paid for by the fathom in depth or in length or by the cubic fathom tribute which is payment for raising and dressing the ore by means of a certain part of its value when rendered merchantable it is this mode of payment which produces such admirable effects the miners who are to be paid in proportion to the richness of the vein and the quantity of metal extracted from it naturally become quicksighted in the discovery of ore and in estimating its value; and it is their interest to avail themselves of every improvement that can bring it more cheaply to market dressing the 'tributors' who dig and dress the ore can seldom afford to dress the coarser parts of what they raise at their contract price; this portion therefore is again let out to other persons who agree to dress it at an advanced price the lots of ore to be dressed and the works to be carried on having been marked out some days before and having been examined by the men a kind of auction is held by the captains of the mine in which each lot is put up and bid for by different gangs of men the work is then offered at a price usually below that bid at the auction to the lowest bidder who rarely declines it at the rate proposed the tribute is a certain sum out of every twenty shillings' worth of ore raised and may vary from threepence to fourteen or fifteen shillings the rate of earnings in tribute is very uncertain if a vein which was poor when taken becomes rich the men earn money rapidly; and instances have occurred in which each miner of a gang has gained a hundred pounds in the two months these extraordinary cases are perhaps of more advantage to the owners of the mine than even to the men; for whilst the skill and industry of the workmen are greatly stimulated the owner himself always derives still greater advantage from the improvement of the vein* this system has been introduced by mr taylor into the lead mines of flintshire into those at skipton in yorkshire and into some of the copper mines of cumberland; and it is desirable that it should become general because no other mode of payment affords to the workmen a measure of success so directly proportioned to the industry the integrity and the talent which they exert  i shall now present the outline of a system which appears to me to be pregnant with the most important results both to the class of workmen and to the country at large; and which if acted upon would in my opinion permanently raise the working classes and greatly extend the manufacturing system the general principles on which the proposed system is founded are  that a considerable part of the wages received by each person employed should depend on the profits made by the establishment; and  that every person connected with it should derive more advantage from applying any improvement he might discover to the factory in which he is employed than he could by any other course  it would be difficult to prevail on the large capitalist to enter upon any system which would change the division of the profits arising from the employment of his capital in setting skill and labour in action; any alteration therefore must be expected rather from the small capitalist or from the higher class of workmen who combine the two characters; and to these latter classes whose welfare will be first affected the change is most important i shall therefore first point out the course to be pursued in making the experiment; and then taking a particular branch of trade as an illustration i shall examine the merits and defects of the proposed system as applied to it  let us suppose in some large manufacturing town ten or twelve of the most intelligent and skilful workmen to unite whose characters for sobriety and steadiness are good and are well known among their own class such persons will each possess some small portion of capital; and let them join with one or two others who have raised themselves into the class of small master manufacturers and therefore possess rather a larger portion of capital let these persons after well considering the subject agree to establish a manufactory of fireirons and fenders; and let us suppose that each of the ten workmen can command forty pounds and each of the small capitalists possesses two hundred pounds thus they have a capital of l with which to commence business; and for the sake of simplifying let us further suppose the labour of each of these twelve persons to be worth two pounds a week one portion of their capital will be expended in procuring the tools necessary for their trade which we shall take at l and this must be considered as their fixed capital the remaining l must be employed as circulating capital in purchasing the iron with which their articles are made in paying the rent of their workshops and in supporting themselves and their families until some portion of it is replaced by the sale of the goods produced  now the first question to be settled is what proportion of the profit should be allowed for the use of capital and what for skill and labour? it does not seem possible to decide this question by any abstract reasoning if the capital supplied by each partner is equal all difficulty will be removed; if otherwise the proportion must be left to find its level and will be discovered by experience; and it is probable that it will not fluctuate much let us suppose it to be agreed that the capital of l shall receive the wages of one workman at the end of each week every workman is to receive one pound as wages and one pound is to be divided amongst the owners of the capital after a few weeks the returns will begin to come in; and they will soon become nearly uniform accurate accounts should be kept of every expense and of all the sales; and at the end of each week the profit should be divided a certain portion should be laid aside as a reserved fund another portion for repair of the tools and the remainder being divided into thirteen parts one of these parts would be divided amongst the capitalists and one belong to each workman thus each man would in ordinary circumstances make up his usual wages of two pounds weekly if the factory went on prosperously the wages of the men would increase; if the sales fell off they would be diminished it is important that every person employed in the establishment whatever might be the amount paid for his services whether he act as labourer or porter as the clerk who keeps the accounts or as bookkeeper employed for a few hours once a week to superintend them should receive one half of what his service is worth in fixed salary the other part varying with the success of the undertaking  in such a factory of course division of labour would be introduced some of the workmen would be constantly employed in forging the fireirons others in polishing them others in piercing and forming the fenders it would be essential that the time occupied in each process and also its expense should be well ascertained; information which would soon be obtained very precisely now if a workman should find a mode of shortening any of the processes he would confer a benefit on the whole party even if they received but a small part of the resulting profit for the promotion of such discoveries it would be desirable that those who make them should either receive some reward to be determined after a sufficient trial by a committee assembling periodically; or if they be of high importance that the discoverer should receive onehalf or twothirds of the profit resulting from them during the next year or some other determinate period as might be found expedient as the advantages of such improvements would be clear gain to the factory it is obvious that such a share might be allowed to the inventor that it would be for his interest rather to give the benefit of them to his partners than to dispose of them in any other way  the result of such arrangements in a factory would be  that every person engaged in it would have a direct interest in its prosperity; since the effect of any success or falling off would almost immediately produce a corresponding change in his own weekly receipts  every person concerned in the factory would have an immediate interest in preventing any waste or mismanagement in all the departments  the talents of all connected with it would be strongly directed to its improvement in every department  none but workmen of high character and qualifications could obtain admission into such establishments; because when any additional hands were required it would be the common interest of all to admit only the most respectable and skilful; and it would be far less easy to impose upon a dozen workmen than upon the single proprietor of a factory  when any circumstance produced a glut in the market more skill would be directed to diminishing the cost of production; and a portion of the time of the men might then be occupied in repairing and improving their tools for which a reserved fund would pay thus checking present and at the same time facilitating future production  another advantage of no small importance would be the total removal of all real or imaginary causes for combinations the workmen and the capitalist would so shade into each other would so evidently have a common interest and their difficulties and distresses would be mutually so well understood that instead of combining to oppress one another the only combination which could exist would be a most powerful union between both parties to overcome their common difficulties  one of the difficulties attending such a system is that capitalists would at first fear to embark in it imagining that the workmen would receive too large a share of the profits and it is quite true that the workmen would have a larger share than at present but at the same time it is presumed the effect of the whole system would be that the total profits of the establishment being much increased the smaller proportion allowed to capital under this system would yet be greater in actual amount than that which results to it from the larger share in the system now existing  it is possible that the present laws relating to partnerships might interfere with factories so conducted if this interference could not be obviated by confining their purchases under the proposed system to ready money it would be desirable to consider what changes in the law would be necessary to its existence and this furnishes another reason for entering into the question of limited partnerships  a difficulty would occur also in discharging workmen who behaved ill or who were not competent to their work; this would arise from their having a certain interest in the reserved fund and perhaps from their possessing a certain portion of the capital employed; but without entering into detail it may be observed that such cases might be determined on by meetings of the whole establishment; and that if the policy of the laws favoured such establishments it would scarcely be more difficult to enforce just regulations than it now is to enforce some which are unjust by means of combinations either amongst the masters or the men  some approach to this system is already practised in several trades the mode of conducting the cornish mines has already been alluded to; the payment to the crew of whaling ships is governed by this principle; the profits arising from fishing with nets on the south coast of england are thus divided onehalf the produce belongs to the owner of the boat and net; the other half is divided in equal portions between the persons using it who are also bound to assist in repairing the net when injured notes  for a detailed account of the method of working the cornish mines see a paper of mr john taylor's transactions of the geological society vol ii p chapter  on contriving machinery  the power of inventing mechanical contrivances and of combining machinery does not appear if we may judge from the frequency of its occurrence to be a difficult or a rare gift of the vast multitude of inventions which have been produced almost daily for a series of years a large part has failed from the imperfect nature of the first trials; whilst a still larger portion which had escaped the mechanical difficulties failed only because the economy of their operations was not sufficiently attended to the commissioners appointed to examine into the methods proposed for preventing the forgery of banknotes state in their report that out of one hundred and seventyeight projects communicated to the bank and to the commissioners there were only twelve of superior skill and nine which it was necessary more particularly to examine  it is however a curious circumstance that although the power of combining machinery is so common yet the more beautiful combinations are exceedingly rare those which command our admiration equally by the perfection of their effects and the simplicity of their means are found only amongst the happiest productions of genius to produce movements even of a complicated kind is not difficult there exist a great multitude of known contrivances for all the more usual purposes and if the exertion of moderate power is the end of the mechanism to be contrived it is possible to construct the whole machine upon paper and to judge of the proper strength to be given to each part as well as to the framework which supports it and also of its ultimate effect long before a single part of it has been executed in fact all the contrivance and all the improvements ought first to be represented in the drawings  on the other hand there are effects dependent upon physical or chemical properties for the determination of which no drawings will be of any use these are the legitimate objects of direct trial for example; if the ultimate result of an engine is to be that it shall impress letters on a copperplate by means of steel punches forced into it all the mechanism by which the punches and the copper are to be moved at stated intervals and brought into contact is within the province of drawing and the machinery may be arranged entirely upon paper but a doubt may reasonably spring up whether the bur that will be raised round the letter which has been already punched upon the copper may not interfere with the proper action of the punch for the letter which is to be punched next adjacent to it it may also be feared that the effect of punching the second letter if it be sufficiently near to the first may distort the form of that first figure if neither of these evils should arise still the bur produced by the punching might be expected to interfere with the goodness of the impression produced by the copperplate; and the plate itself after having all but its edge covered with figures might change its form from the unequal condensation which it must suffer in this process so as to render it very difficult to take impressions from it at all it is impossible by any drawings to solve difficulties such as these experiment alone can determine their effect such experiments having been made it is found that if the sides of the steel punch are nearly at right angles to the face of the letter the bur produced is very inconsiderable; that at the depth which is sufficient for copperplate printing no distortion of the adjacent letters takes place although those letters are placed very close to each other; that the small bur which arises may easily be scraped off; and that the copperplate is not distorted by the condensation of the metal in punching but is perfectly fit to print from after it has undergone that process  the next stage in the progress of an invention after the drawings are finished and the preliminary experiments have been made if any such should be requisite is the execution of the machine itself it can never be too strongly impressed upon the minds of those who are devising new machines that to make the most perfect drawings of every part tends essentially both to the success of the trial and to economy in arriving at the result the actual execution from working drawings is comparatively an easy task; provided always that good tools are employed and that methods of working are adopted in which the perfection of the part constructed depends less on the personal skill of the workman than upon the certainty of the method employed  the causes of failure in this stage most frequently derive their origin from errors in the preceding one; and it is sufficient merely to indicate a few of their sources they frequently arise from having neglected to take into consideration that metals are not perfectly rigid but elastic a steel cylinder of small diameter must not be regarded as an inflexible rod; but in order to ensure its perfect action as an axis it must be supported at proper intervals again the strength and stiffness of the framing which supports the mechanism must be carefully attended to it should always be recollected that the addition of superfluous matter to the immovable parts of a machine produces no additional momentum and therefore is not accompanied with the same evil that arises when the moving parts are increased in weight the stiffness of the framing in a machine produces an important advantage if the bearings of the axis those places at which they are supported are once placed in a straight line they will remain so if the framing be immovable; whereas if the framework changes its form though ever so slightly considerable friction is immediately produced this effect is so well understood in the districts where spinning factories are numerous that in estimating the expense of working a new factory it is allowed that five per cent on the power of the steamengine will be saved if the building is fireproof for the greater strength and rigidity of a fireproof building prevents the movement of the long shafts or axes which drive the machinery from being impeded by the friction that would arise from the slightest deviation in any of the bearings  in conducting experiments upon machinery it is quite a mistake to suppose that any imperfect mechanical work is good enough for such a purpose if the experiment is worth making it ought to be tried with all the advantages of which the state of mechanical art admits; for an imperfect trial may cause an idea to be given up which better workmanship might have proved to be practicable on the other hand when once the efficiency of a contrivance has been established with good workmanship it will be easy afterwards to ascertain the degree of perfection which will suffice for its due action  it is partly owing to the imperfection of the original trials and partly to the gradual improvements in the art of making machinery that many inventions which have been tried and given up in one state of art have at another period been eminently successful the idea of printing by means of moveable types had probably suggested itself to the imagination of many persons conversant with impressions taken either from blocks or seals we find amongst the instruments discovered in the remains of pompeii and herculaneum stamps for words formed out of one piece of metal and including several letters the idea of separating these letters and of recombining them into other words for the purpose of stamping a book could scarcely have failed to occur to many but it would almost certainly have been rejected by those best acquainted with the mechanical arts of that time; for the workmen of those days must have instantly perceived the impossibility of producing many thousand pieces of wood or metal fitting so perfectly and ranging so uniformly as the types or blocks of wood now used in the art of printing the principle of the press which bears the name of bramah was known about a century and a half before the machine to which it gave rise existed; but the imperfect state of mechanical art in the time of the discoverer would have effectually deterred him if the application of it had occurred to his mind from attempting to employ it in practice as an instrument for exerting force these considerations prove the propriety of repeating at the termination of intervals during which the art of making machinery has received any great improvement the trails of methods which although founded upon just principles had previously failed  when the drawings of a machine have been properly made and the parts have been well executed and even when the work it produces possesses all the qualities which were anticipated still the invention may fail; that is it may fail of being brought into general practice this will most frequently arise from the circumstance of its producing its work at a greater expense than that at which it can be made by other methods  whenever the new or improved machine is intended to become the basis of a manufacture it is essentially requisite that the whole expense attending its operations should be fully considered before its construction is undertaken it is almost always very difficult to make this estimate of the expense the more complicated the mechanism the less easy is the task; and in cases of great complexity and extent of machinery it is almost impossible it has been estimated roughly that the first individual of any newly invented machine will cost about five times as much as the construction of the second an estimate which is perhaps sufficiently near the truth if the second machine is to be precisely like the first the same drawings and the same patterns will answer for it; but if as usually happens some improvements have been suggested by the experience of the first these must be more or less altered when however two or three machines have been completed and many more are wanted they can usually be produced at much less than onefifth of the expense of the original invention  the arts of contriving of drawing and of executing do not usually reside in their greatest perfection in one individual; and in this as in other arts the division of labour must be applied the best advice which can be offered to a projector of any mechanical invention is to employ a respectable draughtsman; who if he has had a large experience in his profession will assist in finding out whether the contrivance is new and can then make working drawings of it the first step however the ascertaining whether the contrivance has the merit of novelty is most important; for it is a maxim equally just in all the arts and in every science that the man who aspires to fortune or to fame by new discoveries must be content to examine with care the knowledge of his contemporaries or to exhaust his efforts in inventing again what he will most probably find has been better executed before  this nevertheless is a subject upon which even ingenious men are often singularly negligent there is perhaps no trade or profession existing in which there is so much quackery so much ignorance of the scientific principles and of the history of their own art with respect to its resources and extent as are to be met with amongst mechanical projectors the selfconstituted engineer dazzled with the beauty of some perhaps really original contrivance assumes his new profession with as little suspicion that previous instruction that thought and painful labour are necessary to its successful exercise as does the statesman or the senator much of this false confidence arises from the improper estimate which is entertained of the difficulty of invention in mechanics it is therefore of great importance to the individuals and to the families of those who are too often led away from more suitable pursuits the dupes of their own ingenuity and of the popular voice to convince both them and the public that the power of making new mechanical combinations is a possession common to a multitude of minds and that the talents which it requires are by no means of the highest order it is still more important that they should be impressed with the conviction that the great merit and the great success of those who have attained to eminence in such matters was almost entirely due to the unremitted perseverance with which they concentrated upon their successful inventions the skill and knowledge which years of study had matured  chapter  proper circumstances for the application of machinery  the first object of machinery the chief cause of its extensive utility is the perfection and the cheap production of the articles which it is intended to make whenever it is required to produce a great multitude of things all of exactly the same kind the proper time has arrived for the construction of tools or machines by which they may be manufactured if only a few pairs of cotton stockings should be required it would be an absurd waste of time and of capital to construct a stockingframe to weave them when for a few pence four steel wires can be procured by which they may be knit if on the other hand many thousand pairs were wanted the time employed and the expense incurred in constructing a stockingframe would be more than repaid by the saving of time in making that large number of stockings the same principle is applicable to the copying of letters if three or four copies only are required the pen and the human hand furnish the cheapest means of obtaining them; if hundreds are called for lithography may be brought to our assistance; but if hundreds of thousands are wanted the machinery of a printing establishment supplies the most economical method of accomplishing the object  there are however many cases in which machines or tools must be made in which economical production is not the most important object whenever it is required to produce a few articles parts of machinery for instance which must be executed with the most rigid accuracy or be perfectly alikeit is nearly impossible to fulfil this condition even with the aid of the most skilful hands and it becomes necessary to make tools expressly for the purpose although those tools should as frequently happens cost more in constructing than the things they are destined to make  another instance of the just application of machinery even at an increased expense arises where the shortness of time in which the article is produced has an important influence on its value in the publication of our daily newspapers it frequently happens that the debates in the houses of parliament are carried on to three and four o'clock in the morning that is to within a very few hours of the time for the publication of the paper the speeches must be taken down by reporters conveyed by them to the establishment of the newspaper perhaps at the distance of one or two miles transcribed by them in the office set up by the compositor the press corrected and the paper be printed off and distributed before the public can read them some of these journals have a circulation of from five to ten thousand daily supposing four thousand to be wanted and that they could be printed only at the rate of five hundred per hour upon one side of the paper which was the greatest number two journeymen and a boy could take off by the old hand presses sixteen hours would be required for printing the complete edition; and the news conveyed to the purchasers of the latest portion of the impression would be out of date before they could receive it to obviate this difficulty it was often necessary to set up the paper in duplicate and sometimes when late in triplicate but the improvements in the printing machines have been so great that four thousand copies are now printed on one side in an hour  the establishment of 'the times' newspaper is an example on a large scale of a manufactory in which the division of labour both mental and bodily is admirably illustrated and in which also the effect of domestic economy is well exemplified it is scarcely imagined by the thousands who read that paper in various quarters of the globe what a scene of organized activity the factory presents during the whole night or what a quantity of talent and mechanical skill is put in action for their amusement and information * nearly a hundred persons are employed in this establishment; and during the session of parliament at least twelve reporters are constantly attending the houses of commons and lords; each in his turn retiring after about an hour's work to translate into ordinary writing the speech he has just heard and noted in shorthand in the meantime fifty compositors are constantly at work some of whom have already set up the beginning whilst others are committing to type the yet undried manuscript of the continuation of a speech whose middle portion is travelling to the office in the pocket of the hasty reporter and whose eloquent conclusion is perhaps at that very moment making the walls of st stephen's vibrate with the applause of its hearers these congregated types as fast as they are composed are passed in portions to other hands; till at last the scattered fragments of the debate forming when united with the ordinary matter eightandforty columns reappear in regular order on the platform of the printingpress the hand of man is now too slow for the demands of his curiosity but the power of steam comes to his assistance ink is rapidly supplied to the moving types by the most perfect mechanism; four attendants incessantly introduce the edges of large sheets of white paper to the junction of two great rollers which seem to devour them with unsated appetite; other rollers convey them to the type already inked and having brought them into rapid and successive contact redeliver them to four other assistants completely printed by the almost momentary touch thus in one hour four thousand sheets of paper are printed on one side; and an impression of twelve thousand copies from above three hundred thousand moveable pieces of metal is produced for the public in six hours  the effect of machinery in printing other periodical publications and of due economy in distributing them is so important for the interests of knowledge that it is worth examining by what means it is possible to produce them at the small price at which they are sold 'chambers' journal' which is published at edinburgh and sold at three halfpence a number will furnish an example soon after its commencement in the sale in scotland reached and in order to supply the demand in london it was reprinted; but on account of the expense of 'composition' it was found that this plan would not produce any profit and the london edition was about to be given up when it occurred to the proprietor to stereotype it at edinburgh and cast two copies of the plates this is now done about three weeks before the day of publicationone set of plates being sent up to london by the mail an impression is printed off by steam the london agent has then time to send packages by the cheapest conveyances to several of the large towns and other copies go through the booksellers' parcels to all the smaller towns thus a great saving is effected in the outlay of capital and copies are conveyed from london as a centre to all parts of england whilst there is no difficulty in completing imperfect sets nor any waste from printing more than the public demand  the conveyance of letters is another case in which the importance of saving time would allow of great expense in any new machinery for its accomplishment there is a natural limit to the speed of horses which even the greatest improvements in the breed aided by an increased perfection in our roads can never surpass; and from which perhaps we are at present not very remote when we reflect upon the great expense of time and money which the last refinements of a theory or an art usually require it is not unreasonable to suppose that the period has arrived in which the substitution of machinery for such purposes ought to be tried  the post bag despatched every evening by the mail to one of our largest cities bristol usually weighs less than a hundred pounds now the first reflection which naturally presents itself is that in order to transport these letters a hundred and twenty miles a coach and apparatus weighing above thirty hundredweight are put in motion and also conveyed over the same space * it is obvious that amongst the conditions of machinery for accomplishing such an object it would be desirable to reduce the weight of matter to be conveyed along with the letters it would also be desirable to reduce the velocity of the animal power employed; because the faster a horse is driven the less weight he can draw amongst the variety of contrivances which might be imagined for this purpose we will mention one which although by no means free from objections fulfils some of the prescribed conditions; and it is not a purely theoretical speculation since some few experiments have been made upon it though on an extremely limited scale  let us imagine a series of high pillars erected at frequent intervals perhaps every hundred feet and as nearly as possible in a straight line between two post towns an iron or steel wire must be stretched over proper supports fixed on each of these pillars and terminating at the end of every three or five miles as may be found expedient in a very strong support by which it may be stretched at each of these latter points a man ought to reside in a small stationhouse a narrow cylindrical tin case to contain the letters might be suspended by two wheels rolling upon this wire; the cases being so constructed as to enable the wheels to pass unimpeded by the fixed supports of the wire an endless wire of much smaller size must pass over two drums one at each end of the station this wire should be supported on rollers fixed to the supports of the great wire and at a short distance below it there would thus be two branches of the smaller wire always accompanying the larger one; and the attendant at either station by turning the drum might cause them to move with great velocity in opposite directions in order to convey the cylinder which contains the letters it would only be necessary to attach it by a string or by a catch to either of the branches of the endless wire thus it would be conveyed speedily to the next station where it would be removed by the attendant to the commencement of the next wire and so forwarded it is unnecessary to enter into the details which this or any similar plan would require the difficulties are obvious; but if these could be overcome it would present many advantages besides velocity; for if an attendant resided at each station the additional expense of having two or three deliveries of letters every day and even of sending expresses at any moment would be comparatively trifling; nor is it impossible that the stretched wire might itself be available for a species of telegraphic communication yet more rapid perhaps if the steeples of churches properly selected were made use of connecting them by a few intermediate stations with some great central building as for instance with the top of st paul's; and if a similar apparatus were placed on the top of each steeple with a man to work it during the day it might be possible to diminish the expense of the twopenny post and make deliveries every half hour over the greater part of the metropolis  the power of steam however bids fair almost to rival the velocity of these contrivances; and the fitness of its application to the purposes of conveyance particularly where great rapidity is required begins now to be generally admitted the following extract from the report of the committee of the house of commons on steamcarriages explains clearly its various advantages perhaps one of the principal advantages resulting from the use of steam will be that it may be employed as cheaply at a quick as at a slow rate; 'this is one of the advantages over horse labour which becomes more and more expensive as the speed is increased there is every reason to expect that in the end the rate of travelling by steam will be much quicker than the utmost speed of travelling by horses; in short the safety to travellers will become the limit to speed' in horsedraught the opposite result takes place; 'in all cases horses lose power of draught in a much greater proportion than they gain speed and hence the work they do becomes more expensive as they go quicker' without increase of cost then we shall obtain a power which will insure a rapidity of internal communication far beyond the utmost speed of horses in draught; and although the performance of these carriages may not have hitherto attained this point when once it has been established that at equal speed we can use steam more cheaply in draught than horses we may fairly anticipate that every day's increased experience in the management of the engines will induce greater skill greater confidence and greater speed the cheapness of the conveyance will probably be for some time a secondary consideration if at present it can be used as cheaply as horse power the competition with the former modes of conveyance will first take place as to speed when once the superiority of steamcarriages shall have been fully established competition will induce economy in the cost of working them the evidence however of mr macneill shewing the greater efficiency with diminished expenditure of fuel by locomotive engines on railways convinces the committee that experience will soon teach a better construction of the engines and a less costly mode of generating the requisite supply of steam nor are the advantages of steampower confined to the greater velocity attained or to its greater cheapness than horsedraught in the latter danger is increased in as large a proportion as expense by greater speed in steampower on the contrary 'there is no danger of being run away with and that of being overturned is greatly diminished it is difficult to control four such horses as can draw a heavy carriage ten miles per hour in case they are frightened or choose to run away; and for quick travelling they must be kept in that state of courage that they are always inclined for running away particularly down hills and at sharp turns of the road in steam however there is little corresponding danger being perfectly controllable and capable of exerting its power in reverse in going down hills every witness examined has given the fullest and most satisfactory evidence of the perfect control which the conductor has over the movement of the carriage with the slightest exertion it can be stopped or turned under circumstances where horses would be totally unmanageable  another instance may be mentioned in which the object to be obtained is so important that although it might be rarely wanted yet machinery for that purpose would justify considerable expense a vessel to contain men and to be navigated at some distance below the surface of the sea would in many circumstances be almost invaluable such a vessel evidently could not be propelled by any engine requiring the aid of fire if however by condensing air into a liquid and carrying it in that state a propelling power could be procured sufficient for moving the vessel through a considerable space the expense would scarcely render its occasional employment impossible*  slide of alpnach amongst the forests which flank many of the lofty mountains of switzerland some of the finest timber is found in positions almost inaccessible the expense of roads even if it were possible to make them in such situations would prevent the inhabitants from deriving any advantages from these almost inexhaustible supplies placed by nature at a considerable elevation above the spot at which they can be made use of they are precisely in fit circumstances for the application of machinery to their removal; and the inhabitants avail themselves of the force of gravity to relieve them from some portion of this labour the inclined planes which they have established in various forests by which the timber has been sent down to the water courses have excited the admiration of every traveller; and in addition to the merit of simplicity the construction these slides requires scarcely anything beyond the material which grows upon the spot of all these specimens of carpentry the slide of alpnach was the most considerable from its great length and from the almost inaccessible position from which it descended the following account of it is taken from gilbert's annalen which is translated in the second volume of brewster's journal for many centuries the rugged flanks and the deep gorges of mount pilatus were covered with impenetrable forests; which were permitted to grow and to perish without being of the least utility to man till a foreigner who had been conducted into their wild recesses in the pursuit of the chamois directed the attention of several swiss gentlemen to the extent and superiority of the timber the most skilful individuals however considered it quite impracticable to avail themselves of such inaccessible stores it was not till the end of that m rupp and three swiss gentlemen entertaining more sanguine hopes purchased a certain extent of the forests and began the construction of the slide which was completed in the spring of  the slide of alpnach is formed entirely of about large pine trees deprived of their bark and united together in a very ingenious manner without the aid of iron it occupied about workmen during eighteen months and cost nearly francs or l it is about three leagues or english feet long and terminates in the lake of lucerne it has the form of a trough about six feet broad and from three to six feet deep its bottom is formed of three trees the middle one of which has a groove cut out in the direction of its length for receiving small rills of water which are conducted into it from various places for the purpose of diminishing the friction the whole of the slide is sustained by about supports; and in many places it is attached in a very ingenious manner to the rugged precipices of granite the direction of the slide is sometimes straight and sometimes zigzag with an inclination of from degrees to degrees it is often carried along the sides of hills and the flanks of precipitous rocks and sometimes passes over their summits occasionally it goes under ground and at other times it is conducted over the deep gorges by scaffoldings feet in height the boldness which characterizes this work the sagacity and skill displayed in all its arrangements have excited the wonder of every person who has seen it before any step could be taken in its erection it was necessary to cut several thousand trees to obtain a passage through the impenetrable thickets all these difficulties however were surmounted and the engineer had at last the satisfaction of seeing the trees descend from the mountain with the rapidity of lightning the larger pines which were about a hundred feet long and ten inches thick at their smaller extremity ran through the space of three leagues or nearly nine miles in two minutes and a half and during their descent they appeared to be only a few feet in length the arrangements for this part of the operation were extremely simple from the lower end of the slide to the upper end where the trees were introduced workmen were posted at regular distances and as soon as everything was ready the workman at the lower end of the slide cried out to the one above him 'lachez' let go the cry was repeated from one to another and reached the top of the slide in three minutes the workmen at the top of the slide then cried out to the one below him 'il vient' it comes and the tree was instantly launched down the slide preceded by the cry which was repeated from post to post as soon as the tree had reached the bottom and plunged into the lake the cry of lachez was repeated as before and a new tree was launched in a similar manner by these means a tree descended every five or six minutes provided no accident happened to the slide which sometimes took place but which was instantly repaired when it did in order to shew the enormous force which the trees acquired from the great velocity of their descent m rupp made arrangements for causing some of the trees to spring from the slide they penetrated by their thickest extremities no less than from eighteen to twentyfour feet into the earth; and one of the trees having by accident struck against another it instantly cleft it through its whole length as if it had been struck by lightning after the trees had descended the slide they were collected into rafts upon the lake and conducted to lucerne from thence they descended the reuss then the aar to near brugg afterwards to waldshut by the rhine then to basle and even to the sea when it was necessary it is to be regretted that this magnificent structure no longer exists and that scarcely a trace of it is to be seen upon the flanks of mount pilatus political circumstances having taken away the principal source of demand for the timber and no other market having been found the operation of cutting and transporting the trees necessarily ceased* professor playfair who visited this singular work states that six minutes was the usual time occupied in the descent of a tree; but that in wet weather it reached the lake in three minutes notes  the author of these pages with one of his friends was recently induced to visit this most interesting establishment after midnight during the progress of a very important debate the place was illuminated with gas and was light as the day there was neither noise nor bustle; and the visitors were received with such calm and polite attention that they did not until afterwards become sensible of the inconvenience which such intruders at a moment of the greatest pressure must occasion nor reflect tha the tranquility which they admired was the result of intense and regulated occupation but the effect of such checks in the current of business will appear on recollecting that as four thousand newspapers are printed off on one side within the hour every minute is attended with a loss of sixtysix impressions the quarter of an hour therefore which the stranger may think it not unreasonable to claim for the gratification of his curiosity and to him this time is but a moment may cause a failure in the delivery of a thousand copies and disappoint a proportionate number of expectant readers in some of our distant towns to which the morning papers are dispatched by the earliest and most rapid conveyances of each day this note is inserted with the further and more general purpose of calling the attention of those especially foreigners who are desirous of inspecting our larger manufactories to the chief cause of the difficulty which frequently attends their introduction when the establishment is very extensive and its departments skilfully arranged the exclusion of visitors arises not from any illiberal jealousy nor generally from any desire of concealment which would in most cases be absurd but from the substantial inconvenience and loss of time throughout an entire series of wellcombined operations which must be occasioned even by short and causual interruptions  it is true that the transport of letters is not the only object which this apparatus answers; but the transport of passengers which is a secondary object does in fact put a limit to the velocity of that of the letters which is the primary one  a proposal for such a vessel

adjacent mountains by a slide similar to that of alpnach it was constructed by m floresi a gentleman well acquainted with switzerland  chapter  on the duration of machinery  the time during which a machine will continue to perform its work effectually will depend chiefly upon the perfection with which it was originally constructed upon the care taken to keep it in proper repair particularly to correct every shake or looseness in the axesand upon the smallness of the mass and of the velocity of its moving parts everything approaching to a blow all sudden change of direction is injurious engines for producing power such as windmills watermills and steamengines usually last a long time*  many of the improvements which have taken place in steamengines have arisen from an improved construction of the boiler or the fireplace the following table of the work done by steamengines in cornwall whilst it proves the importance of constantly measuring the effects of machinery shows also the gradual advance which has been made in the art of constructing and managing those engines  a table of the duty performed by steamengines in cornwall shewing the average of the whole for each year and also the average duty of the best engine in each monthly report years; approximate number of engines reported; average duty of the whole; average duty of the best engines  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ;

cornwall has been so great that the proprietors of one of the largest mines on which there are several engines find it good economy to employ a man to measure the duty they perform every day this daily report is fixed up at a particular hour and the enginemen are always in waiting anxious to know the state of their engines as the general reports are made monthly if accident should cause a partial stoppage in the flue of any of the boilers it might without this daily check continue two or three weeks before it could be discovered by a falling off of the duty of the engine in several of the mines a certain amount of duty is assigned to each engine; and if it does more the proprietors give a premium to the engineers according to its amount this is called million money and is a great stimulus to economy in working the engine  machinery for producing any commodity in great demand seldom actually wears out; new improvements by which the same operations can be executed either more quickly or better generally superseding it long before that period arrives indeed to make such an improved machine profitable it is usually reckoned that in five years it ought to have paid itself and in ten to be superseded by a better 'a cotton manufacturer' says one of the witnesses before a committee of the house of commons 'who left manchester seven years ago would be driven out of the market by the men who are now living in it provided his knowledge had not kept pace with those who have been during that time constantly profiting by the progressive improvements that have taken place in that period'  the effect of improvements in machinery seems incidentally to increase production through a cause which may be thus explained a manufacturer making the usual profit upon his capital invested in looms or other machines in perfect condition the market price of making each of which is a hundred pounds invents some improvement but this is of such a nature that it cannot be adapted to his present engines he finds upon calculation that at the rate at which he can dispose of his manufactured produce each new engine would repay the cost of its making together with the ordinary profit of capital in three years he also concludes from his experience of the trade that the improvement he is about to make will not be generally adopted by other manufacturers before that time on these considerations it is clearly his interest to sell his present engines even at halfprice and construct new ones on the improved principle but the purchaser who gives only fifty pounds for the old engines has not so large a fixed capital invested in his factory as the person from whom he purchased them; and as he produces the same quantity of the manufactured article his profits will be larger hence the price of the commodity will fall not only in consequence of the cheaper production by the new machines but also by the more profitable working of the old thus purchased at a reduced price this change however can be only transient; for a time will arrive when the old machinery although in good repair must become worthless the improvement which took place not long ago in frames for making patentnet was so great that a machine in good repair which had cost l sold a few years after for l during the great speculations in that trade the improvements succeeded each other so rapidly that machines which had never been finished were abandoned in the hands of their makers because new improvements had superseded their utility  the durability of watches when well made is very remarkable one was produced in going order before a committee of the house of commons to enquire into the watch trade which was made in the year ; and there are many of ancient date in the possession of the clockmaker's company which are still actually kept going the number of watches manufactured for home consumption was in the year about annually if this supply was for great britain only it was consumed by about ten and a half millions of persons  machines are in some trades let out to hire and a certain sum is paid for their use; in the manner of rent this is the case amongst the framework knitters and mr henson in speaking of the rate of payment for the use of their frames states that the proprietor receives such a rent that besides paying the full interest for his capital he clears the value of his frame in nine years when the rapidity with which improvements succeed each other is considered this rent does not appear exorbitant some of these frames have been worked for thirteen years with little or no repair but circumstances occasionally arise which throw them out of employment either temporarily or permanently some years since an article was introduced called cutup work by which the price of stockingframes was greatly deteriorated from the evidence of mr j rawson it appears that in consequence of this change in the nature of the work each frame could do the work of two and many stocking frames were thrown out of employment and their value reduced full threefourths* this information is of great importance if the numbers here given are nearly correct and if no other causes intervened to diminish the price of frames; for it shews the numerical connection between the increased production of those machines and their diminished value  the great importance of simplifying all transactions between masters and workmen and of dispassionately discussing with the latter the influence of any proposed regulations connected with their trade is well examplified by a mistake into which both parties unintentionally fell and which was productive of very great misery in the lace trade its history is so well told by william allen a framework knitter who was a party to it that an extract from his evidence as given before the framework knitters' committee of will best explain it i beg to say a few words respecting the frame rent; the rent paid for lace frames until the year was s d a frame per week; there then was not any very great inducement for persons to buy frames and let them out by the hire who did not belong to the trade; at that time an attempt was made by one or two houses to reduce the prices paid to the workmen in consequence of a dispute between these two houses and another great house some little difference being paid in the price amongst the respective houses i was one chosen by the workmen to try if we could not remedy the impending evil we consulted the respective parties and found them inflexible; these two houses that were about to reduce the prices said that they would either immediately reduce the price of making net or they would increase the frame rent the difference to the workmen was considerable between the one and the other; they would suffer less in the immediate operation of the thing by having the rent advanced than the price of making net reduced they chose at that time as they thought the lesser evil but it has turned out to be otherwise; for immediately as the rent was raised upon the percentage laid out in frames it induced almost every person who had got a little money to lay it out in the purchase of frames; these frames were placed in the hands of men who could get work for them at the warehouses; they were generally constrained to pay an enormous rent and then they were compelled most likely to buy of the persons that let them the frames their butcher's meat their grocery or their clothing the encumbrance of these frames became entailed upon them if any deadness took place in the work they must take it at a very reduced price for fear of the consequences that would fall upon them from the person who bought the frame thus the evil has been daily increasing till in conjunction with the other evils crept into the trade they have almost crushed it to atoms  the evil of not assigning fairly to each tool or each article produced its proportionate value or even of not having a perfectly distinct simple and definite agreement between a master and his workmen is very considerable workmen find it difficult in such cases to know the probable produce of their labour; and both parties are often led to adopt arrangements which had they been well examined would have been rejected as equally at variance in the results with the true interests of both  at birmingham stamps and dies and presses for a great variety of articles are let out they are generally made by men possessing small capital and are rented by workmen power also is rented at the same place steamengines are erected in large buildings containing a variety of rooms in which each person may hire one two or any other amount of horsepower as his occupation may require if any mode could be discovered of transmitting power without much loss from friction to considerable distances and at the same time of registering the quantity made use of at any particular point a considerable change would probably take place in many departments of the present system of manufacturing a few central engines to produce power might then be erected in our great towns and each workman hiring a quantity of power sufficient for his purpose might have it conveyed into his own house; and thus a transition might in some instances be effected if it should be found more profitable back again from the system of great factories to that of domestic manufacture  the transmission of water through a series of pipes might be employed for the distribution of power but the friction would consume a considerable portion another method has been employed in some instances and is practised at the mint it consists in exhausting the air from a large vessel by means of a steamengine this vessel is connected by pipes with a small piston which drives each coining press; and on opening a valve the pressure of the external air forces in the piston this air is then admitted to the general reservoir and pumped out by the engine the condensation of air might be employed for the same purpose; but there are some unexplained facts relating to elastic fluids which require further observations and experiment before they can be used for the conveyance of power to any considerable distance it has been found for instance in attempting to blow a furnace by means of a powerful waterwheel driving air through a castiron pipe of above a mile in length that scarcely any sensible effect was produced at the opposite extremity in one instance some accidental obstruction being suspected a cat put in at one end found its way out without injury at the other thus proving that the phenomenon did not depend on interruption within the pipe  the most portable form in which power can be condensed is perhaps by the liquefaction of the gases it is known that under considerable pressure several of these become liquid at ordinary temperatures; carbonic acid for example is reduced to a liquid state by a pressure of sixty atmospheres one of the advantages attending the use of these fluids would be that the pressure exerted by them would remain constant until the last drop of liquid had assumed the form of gas if either of the elements of common air should be found to be capable of reduction to a liquid state before it unites into a corrosive fluid with the other ingredient then we shall possess a ready means of conveying power in any quantity and to any distance hydrogen probably will require the strongest compressing force to render it liquid and may therefore possibly be applied where still greater condensation of power is wanted in all these cases the condensed gases may be looked upon as springs of enormous force which have been wound up by the exertion of power and which will deliver the whole of it back again when required these springs of nature differ in some respects from the steel springs formed by our art; for in the compression of the natural springs a vast quantity of latent heat is forced out and in their return to the state of gas an equal quantity is absorbed may not this very property be employed with advantage in their application? part of the mechanical difficulty to be overcome in constructing apparatus connected with liquefied gases will consist in the structure of the valves and packing necessary to retain the fluids under the great pressure to which they must be submitted the effect of heat on these gases has not yet been sufficiently tried to lead us to any very precise notions of the additional power which its application to them will supply the elasticity of air is sometimes employed as a spring instead of steel in one of the large printingmachines in london the momentum of a considerable mass of matter is destroyed by making it condense the air included in a cylinder by means of a piston against which it impinges  the effect of competition in cheapening articles of manufacture sometimes operates in rendering them less durable when such articles are conveyed to a distance for consumption if they are broken it often happens from the price of labour being higher where they are used than where they were made that it is more expensive to mend the old article than to purchase a new such is usually the case in great cities with some of the commoner locks with hinges and with a variety of articles of hardware notes  the amount of obstructions arising from the casual fixing of trees in the bottom of the river may be estimated from the proportion of steamboats destroyed by running upon them the subjoined statement is taken from the american almanack for  'between the years and three hundred and fortyeight steamboats were built on the mississippi and its tributary streams during that period a hundred and fifty were lost or worn out 'of this hundred and fifty   worn out     lost by snags    burnt      lost by collision   by accidents   not ascertained thirtysix or nearly one fourth being destroyed by accidental obstructions snag is the name given in america to trees which stand nearly upright in the stream with their roots fixed at the bottom it is usual to divide off at the bow of the steamboats a watertight chamber in order that when a hole is made in it by running against the snags the water may not enter the rest of the vessel and sink it instantly  this passage is not printed in italics in the original but it has been thus marked in the above extract from its importance and from the conviction that the most extended discussion will afford additional evidence of its truth  report from the committee of the house of commons on the framework knitter's petition april chapter  on combinations amongst masters or workmen against each other  there exist amongst the workmen of almost all classes certain rules or laws which govern their actions towards each other and towards their employers but besides these general principles there are frequently others peculiar to each factory which have derived their origin in many instances from the mutual convenience of the parties engaged in them such rules are little known except to those actually pursuing the several trades; and as it is of importance that their advantages and disadvantages should be canvassed we shall offer a few remarks upon some of them  the principles by which such laws should be tried are first that they conduce to the general benefit of all the persons employed secondly that they prevent fraud thirdly that they interfere as little as possible with the free agency of each individual  it is usual in many workshops that on the first entrance of a new journeyman he shall pay a small fine to the rest of the men it is clearly unjust to insist upon this payment; and when it is spent in drinking which is unfortunately too often the case it is injurious the reason assigned for the demand is that the newcomer will require some instruction in the habits of the shop and in the places of the different tools and will thus waste the time of some of his companions until he is instructed if this fine were added to a fund managed by the workmen themselves and either divided at given periods or reserved for their relief in sickness it would be less objectionable since its tendency would be to check the too frequent change of men from one shop to another but it ought at all events not to be compulsory and the advantages to be derived from the fund to which the workman is invited to subscribe ought to be his sole inducement to contribute  in many workshops the workmen although employed on totally different parts of the objects manufactured are yet dependent in some measure upon each other thus a single smith may be able to forge in one day work enough to keep four or five turners employed during the next if from idleness or intemperance the smith neglects his work and does not furnish the usual supply the turners supposing them to be paid by the piece will have their time partly unoccupied and their gains consequently diminished it is reasonable in such circumstances that a fine should be levied on the delinquent; but it is desirable that the master should have concurred with his workmen in establishing such a rule and that it should be shown to each individual previously to his engagement; and it is very desirable that such fine should not be spent in drinking  in some establishments it is customary for the master to give a small gratuity whenever any workman has exercised a remarkable degree of skill or has economized the material employed thus in splitting horn into layers for lanterns one horn usually furnishes from five to eight layers; but if a workman split the horn into ten layers or more he receives a pint of ale from the master these premiums should not be too high lest the material should be wasted in unsuccessful attempts but such regulations when judiciously made are beneficial as they tend to produce skill amongst the workmen profit to the masters and diminished cost to the consumers  in some few factories in which the men are paid by the piece it is usual when any portion of work delivered in by a workman is rejected by the master on account of its being badly executed to fine the delinquent such a practice tends to remedy one of the evils attendant upon that mode of payment and greatly assists the master since his own judgement is thus supported by competent and unprejudiced judges  societies exist amongst some of the larger bodies of workmen and others have been formed by the masters engaged in the same branches of trade these associations have different objects in view; but it is very desirable that their effects should be well understood by the individuals who compose them; and that the advantages arising from them which are certainly great should be separated as much as possible from the evils which they have unfortunately too frequently introduced associations of workmen and of masters may with advantage agree upon rules to be observed by both parties in estimating the proportionate value of different kinds of work executed in their trade in order that time may be saved and disputes be prevented they may also be most usefully employed in acquiring accurate information as to the number of persons working in the various departments of any manufacture their rate of wages the number of machines in use and other statistical details information of this nature is highly valuable both for the guidance of the parties who are themselves most interested and to enable them upon any application to government for assistance or with a view to legislative enactments to supply those details without which the propriety of any proposed measure cannot be duly estimated such details may be collected by men actually engaged in any branch of trade at a much smaller expense of time than by persons less acquainted with and less interested in it  one of the most legitimate and most important objects of such associations as we have just mentioned is to agree upon ready and certain modes of measuring the quantity of work done by the workmen for a long time a difficulty upon this point existed in the lace trade which was justly complained of by the men as a serious grievance; but the introduction of the rack which counts the number of holes in the length of the piece has entirely put an end to the most fertile cause of disputes this invention was adverted to by the committee of and a hope was expressed in their report that the same contrivance would be applied to stockingframes it would indeed be of great mutual advantage to the industrious workman and to the master manufacturer in every trade if the machines employed in it could register the quantity of work which they perform in the same manner as a steamengine does the number of strokes it makes the introduction of such contrivances gives a greater stimulus to honest industry than can readily be imagined and removes one of the sources of disagreement between parties whose real interests must always suffer by any estrangement between them  the effects arising from combinations amongst the workmen are almost always injurious to the parties themselves there are numerous instances in which the public suffer by increased price at the moment but are ultimately gainers from the permanent reduction which results; whilst on the other hand the improvements which are often made in machinery in consequence of 'a strike' amongst the workmen most frequently do injury of greater or less duration to that particular class which gave rise to them as the injury to the men and to their families is almost always more serious than that which affects their employers it is of the utmost importance to the comfort and happiness of the former class that they should themselves entertain sound views upon this question for this purpose a few illustrations of the principle which is here maintained will probably have greater weight than any reasoning of a more general nature though drawn from admitted principles of political economy such instances will moreover present the advantage of appealing to facts known to many individuals of those classes for whose benefit these reflections are intended  there is a process in the manufacture of gun barrels for making what in the language of the trade are called skelps the skelp is a piece or bar of iron about three feet long and four inches wide but thicker and broader at one end than at the other; and the barrel of a musket is formed by forging out such pieces to the proper dimensions and then folding or bending them into a cylindrical form until the edges overlap so that they can be welded together about twenty years ago the workmen employed at a very extensive factory in forging these skelps out of bariron 'struck' for an advance of wages; and as their demands were very exorbitant they were not immediately complied with in the meantime the superintendent of the establishment directed his attention to the subject; and it occurred to him that if the circumference of the rollers between which the bariron was rolled were to be made equal to the length of a skelp or of a musket barrel and if also the groove in which the iron was compressed instead of being of the same width and depth throughout were cut gradually deeper and wider from a point on the rollers until it returned to the same point then the bariron passing between such rollers instead of being uniform in width and thickness would have the form of a skelp on making the trial it was found to succeed perfectly; a great reduction of human labour was effected by the process and the workmen who had acquired peculiar skill in performing it ceased to derive any advantage from their dexterity  it is somewhat singular that another and a still more remarkable instance of the effect of combination amongst workmen should have occurred but a few years since in the very same trade the process of welding the skelps so as to convert them into gun barrels required much skill and after the termination of the war the demand for muskets having greatly diminished the number of persons employed in making them was very much reduced this circumstance rendered combination more easy; and upon one occasion when a contract had been entered into for a considerable supply to be delivered on a fixed day the men all struck for such an advance of wages as would have caused the completion of the contract to be attended with a very heavy loss in this difficulty the contractors resorted to a mode of welding the gun barrel for which a patent had been taken out by one of themselves some years before this event the plan had not then succeeded so well as to come into general use in consequence of the cheapness of the usual mode of welding by hand labour combined with some other difficulties with which the patentee had to contend but the stimulus produced by the combination of the workmen induced him to make new trials and he was enabled to introduce such a facility in welding gun barrels by rollers and such perfection in the work itself that in all probability very few will in future be welded by hand labour this new process consisted in folding a bar of iron about a foot long into the form of a cylinder with the edges a little overlapping it was then placed in a furnace and being taken out when raised to a welding heat a triblet or cylinder of iron was placed in it and the whole was passed quickly through a pair of rollers the effect of this was that the welding was performed at a single heating and the remainder of the elongation necessary for extending the skelps to the length of the musket barrel was performed in a similar manner but at a lower temperature the workmen who had combined were of course no longer wanted and instead of benefiting themselves by their combination they were reduced permanently by this improvement in the art to a considerably lower rate of wages for as the process of welding gun barrels by hand required peculiar skill and considerable experience they had hitherto been in the habit of earning much higher wages than other workmen of their class on the other hand the new method of welding was far less injurious to the texture of the iron which was now exposed only once instead of three or four times to the welding heat so that the public derived advantage from the superiority as well as from the economy of the process another process has subsequently been invented applicable to the manufacture of a lighter kind of iron tubes which can thus be made at a price which renders their employment very general they are now to be found in the shops of all our larger ironmongers of various lengths and diameters with screws cut at each end; and are in constant use for the conveyance of gas for lighting or of water for warming our houses  similar examples must have presented themselves to all those who are familiar with the details of our manufactories but these are sufficient to illustrate one of the results of combinations it would not however be fair to push the conclusion deduced from these instances to its extreme limit although it is very apparent that in the two cases which have been stated the effects of combination were permanently injurious to the workman by almost immediately placing him in a lower class with respect to his wages than he occupied before; yet they do not prove that all such combinations have this effect it is quite evident that they have all this tendency it is also certain that considerable stimulus must be applied to induce a man to contrive a new and expensive process; and that in both these cases unless the fear of pecuniary loss had acted powerfully the improvement would not have been made if therefore the workmen had in either case combined for only a small advance of wages they would in all probability have been successful and the public would have been deprived for many years of the inventions to which these combinations gave rise it must however be observed that the same skill which enabled the men to obtain after long practice higher wages than the rest of their class would prevent many of them from being permanently thrown back into the class of ordinary workmen their diminished wages will continue only until they have acquired by practice a facility of execution in some other of the more difficult operations but a diminution of wages even for a year or two is still a very serious inconvenience to any person who lives by his daily exertion the consequence of combination has then in these instances been to the workmen who combinedreduction of wages; to the public reduction of price; and to the manufacturer increased sale of his commodity resulting from that reduction  it is however important to consider the effects of combination in another and less obvious point of view the fear of combination amongst the men whom he employs will have a tendency to induce the manufacturer to conceal from his workmen the extent of the orders he may at any time have received; and consequently they will always be less acquainted with the extent of the demand for their labour than they otherwise might be this is injurious to their interests; for instead of foreseeing by the gradual fallingoff in the orders the approach of a time when they must be unemployed and preparing accordingly they are liable to much more sudden changes than those to which they would otherwise be exposed in the evidence given by mr galloway the engineer he remarks that when employers are competent to show their men that their business is steady and certain and when men find that they are likely to have permanent employment they have always better habits and more settled notions which will make them better men and better workmen and will produce great benefits to all who are interested in their employment  as the manufacturer when he makes a contract has no security that a combination may not arise amongst the workmen which may render that contract a loss instead of a benefit; besides taking precautions to prevent them from becoming acquainted with it he must also add to the price at which he could otherwise sell the article some small increase to cover the risk of such an occurrence if an establishment consist of several branches which can only be carried on jointly as for instance of iron mines blast furnaces and a colliery in which there are distinct classes of workmen it becomes necessary to keep on hand a larger stock of materials than would be required if it were certain that no combinations would arise suppose for instance the colliers were to 'strike' for an advance of wagesunless there was a stock of coal above ground the furnaces must be stopped and the miners also would be thrown out of employ now the cost of keeping a stock of iron ore or of coals above ground is just the same as that of keeping in a drawer unemployed its value in money except indeed that the coal suffers a small deterioration by exposure to the elements the interest of this sum must therefore be considered as the price of an insurance against the risk of combination amongst the workmen; and it must so far as it goes increase the price of the manufactured article and consequently limit the demand which would otherwise exist for it but every circumstance which tends to limit the demand is injurious to the workmen; because the wider the demand the less it is exposed to fluctuation the effect to which we have alluded is by no means a theoretical conclusion; the proprietors of one establishment in the iron trade within the author's knowledge think it expedient always to keep above ground a supply of coal for six months which is in that instance equal in value to about l when we reflect that the quantity of capital throughout the country thus kept unemployed merely from the fear of combinations amongst the workmen might under other circumstances be used for keeping a larger number at work the importance of introducing a system in which there should exist no inducement to combine becomes additionally evident  that combinations are while they last productive of serious inconveniences to the workmen themselves is admitted by all parties; and it is equally true that in most cases a successful result does not leave them in so good a condition as they were in before 'the strike' the little capital they possessed which ought to have been hoarded with care for days of illness or distress is exhausted; and frequently in order to gratify a pride at the existence of which we cannot but rejoice even whilst we regret its misdirected energy they will undergo the severest privations rather than return to work at their former wages with many of the workmen unfortunately during such periods bad habits are formed which it is very difficult to eradicate; and in all those engaged in such transactions the kinder feelings of the heart are chilled and passions are called into action which are permanently injurious to the happiness of the individual and destructive of those sentiments of confidence which it is equally the interest of the master manufacturer and of his workman to maintain if any of the trade refuse to join in the strike the majority too frequently forget in the excitement of their feelings the dictates of justice and endeavour to exert a species of tyranny which can never be permitted to exist in a free country in conceding therefore to the working classes that they have a right if they consider it expedient to combine for the purpose of procuring higher wages provided always that they have completed all their existing contracts it ought ever to be kept before their attention that the same freedom which they claim for themselves they are bound to allow to others who may have different views of the advantages of combination every effort which reason and kindness can dictate should be made not merely to remove their grievances but to satisfy their own reason and feelings and to show them the consequences which will probably result from their conduct but the strong arm of the law backed as in such cases it will always be by public opinion should be instantly and unhesitatingly applied to prevent them from violating the liberty of a portion of their own or of any other class of society  amongst the evils which ultimately fall heavy on the working classes themselves when through mistaken views they attempt to interfere with their employers in the mode of carrying on their business may be mentioned the removal of factories to other situations where the proprietors may be free from the improper control of their men the removal of a considerable number of lace frames to the western counties which took place in consequence of the combinations in nottinghamshire has already been mentioned other instances have occurred where still greater injury has been produced by the removal of a portion of the skill and capital of the country to a foreign land such was the case at glasgow as stated in the fifth parliamentary report respecting artizans and machinery one of the partners in an extensive cotton factory disgusted by the unprincipled conduct of the workmen removed to the state of new york where he reestablished his machinery and thus afforded to rivals already formidable to our trade at once a pattern of our best machinery and an example of the most economical methods of employing it  when the nature of the work is such that it is not possible to remove it as happens with regard to mines the proprietors are more exposed to injury from combinations amongst the workmen but as the owners are generally possessed of a larger capital they generally succeed if the reduction of wages which they propose is really founded on the necessity of the case an extensive combination lately existed amongst the colliers in the north of england which unfortunately led in several instances to acts of violence the proprietors of the coalmines were consequently obliged to procure the aid of miners from other parts of england who were willing to work at the wages they could afford to give; and the aid of the civil and in some cases of the military power was requisite for their protection this course was persisted in during several months and the question being which party could support itself longest on the diminished gains as it might have readily been foreseen the proprietors ultimately succeeded  one of the remedies employed by the masters against the occurrence of combinations is to make engagements with their men for long periods and to arrange them in such a manner that these contracts shall not all terminate together this has been done in some cases at sheffield and in other places it is attended with the inconvenience to the masters that during periods when the demand for their produce is reduced they are still obliged to employ the same number of workmen this circumstance however frequently obliges the proprietors to direct their attention to improvements in their works and in one such instance within the author's knowledge a large reservoir was deepened thus affording a more constant supply to the waterwheel whilst at the same time the mud from the bottom gave permanent fertility to a piece of land previously almost barren in this case not merely was the supply of produce checked when a glut existed but the labour was in fact applied more profitably than it would have been in the usual course  a mode of paying the wages of workmen in articles which they consume has been introduced into some of our manufacturing districts which has been called the truck system as in many instances this has nearly the effect of a combination of the masters against the men it is a fit subject for discussion in the present chapter but it should be carefully distinguished from another system of a very different tendency which will be first described  the principal necessaries for the support of a workman and his family are few in number and are usually purchased by him in small quantities weekly upon such quantities sold by the retail dealer a large profit is generally made; and if the article is one whose quality like that of tea is not readily estimated then a great additional gain is made by the retail dealer selling an inferior article where the number of workmen living on the same spot is large it may be thought desirable that they should unite together and have an agent to purchase by wholesale those articles which are most in demand as tea suger bacon etc and to retail them at prices which will just repay the wholesale cost together with the expense of the agent who conducts their sale if this be managed wholly by a committee of workmen aided perhaps by advice from the master and if the agent is paid in such a manner as to have himself an interest in procuring good and reasonable articles it may be a benefit to the workmen and if the plan succeed in reducing the cost of articles of necessity to the men it is clearly the interest of the master to encourage it the master may indeed be enabled to afford them facilities in making their wholesale purchases; but he ought never to have the least interest in or any connection with the profit made by the articles sold the men on the other hand who subscribe to set up the shop ought not in the slightest degree to be compelled to make their purchases there the goodness and cheapness of the article ought to be their sole inducements it may perhaps be objected that this plan is only employing a portion of the capital belonging to the workmen in a retail trade; and that without it competition amongst small shopkeepers will reduce the articles to nearly the same price this objection would be valid if the objects of consumption required no verification; but combining what has been already stated on that subject* with the present argument the plan seems liable to no serious objections  the truck system is entirely different in its effects the master manufacturer keeps a retail shop for articles required by his men and either pays their wages in goods or compels them by express agreement or less directly by unfair means to expend the whole or a certain part of their wages at his shop if the manufacturer kept this shop merely for the purpose of securing good articles at fair prices to his workmen and if he offered no inducement to them to purchase at his shop except the superior cheapness of his articles it would certainly be advantageous to the men but unfortunately this is not always the case; and the temptation to the master in times of depression to reduce in effect the wages which he pays by increasing the price of articles at his shop without altering the nominal rate of payment is frequently too great to be withstood if the object be solely to procure for his workmen better articles it will be more effectually accomplished by the master confining himself to supplying a small capital at a moderate rate of interest; leaving the details to be conducted by a committee of workmen in conjunction with his own agent and the books of the shop to be audited periodically by the men themselves  wherever the workmen are paid in goods or are compelled to purchase at the master's shop much injustice is done to them and great misery results from it whatever may have been the intentions of the master in such cases the real effect is to deceive the workman as to the amount he receives in exchange for his labour now the principles on which the happiness of that class of society depends are difficult enough to be understood even by those who are blessed with far better opportunities of investigating them and the importance of their being well acquainted with those principles which relate to themselves is of more vital consequence to workmen than to many other classes it is therefore highly desirable to assist them in comprehending the position in which they are placed by rendering all the relations in which they stand to each other and to their employers as simple as possible workmen should be paid entirely in money; their work should be measured by some unbiassed some unerring piece of mechanism; the time during which they are employed should be defined and punctually adhered to the payments they make to their benefit societies should be fixed on such just principles as not to require extraordinary contributions in short the object of all who wish to promote their happiness should be to give them in the simplest form the means of knowing beforehand the sum they are likely to acquire by their labour and the money they will be obliged to expend for their support thus putting before them in the clearest light the certain result of persevering industry  the cruelty which is inflicted on the workman by the payment of his wages in goods is often very severe the little purchases necessary for the comfort of his wife and children perhaps the medicines he occasionally requires for them in illness must all be made through the medium of barter; and he is obliged to waste his time in arranging an exchange in which the goods which he has been compelled to accept for his labour are invariably taken at a lower price than that at which his master charged them to him the father of a family perhaps writhing under the agonies of the toothache is obliged to make his hasty bargain with the village surgeon before he will remove the cause of his pain; or the disconsolate mother is compelled to sacrifice her depreciated goods in exchange for the last receptacle of her departed offspring the subjoined evidence from the report of the committee of the house of commons on framework knitters' petitions shows that these are not exaggerated statements it has been so common in our town to pay goods instead of money that a number of my neighbours have been obliged to pay articles for articles to pay sugar for drugs out of the druggist's shop; and others have been obliged to pay sugar for drapery goods and such things and exchange in that way numbers of times i was credibly informed that one person paid half a pound of tenpenny sugar and a penny to have a tooth drawn; and there is a credible neighbour of mine told me that he had heard that the sexton had been paid for digging a grave with sugar and tea and before i came off knowing i had to give evidence upon these things i asked this friend to enquire of the sexton whether this was a fact the sexton hesitated for a little time on account of bringing into discredit the person who paid these goods however he said at last 'i have received these articles repeatedlyi know these things have been paid to a great extent in this way' notes  see chapter xv p chapter  on combinations of masters against the public  a species of combination occasionally takes place amongst manufacturers against persons having patents and these combinations are always injurious to the public as well as unjust to the inventors some years since a gentleman invented a machine by which modellings and carvings were cut in mahogany and other fine woods the machine resembled in some measure the drilling apparatus employed in ornamental lathes; it produced beautiful work at a very moderate expense but the cabinetmakers met together and combined against it and the patent has consequently never been worked a similar fate awaited a machine for cutting veneers by means of a species of knife in this instance the wood could be cut thinner than by the circular saw and no waste was incurred; but 'the trade' set themselves against it and after a heavy expense it was given up the excuse alleged for this kind of combination was the fear entertained by the cabinetmakers that when the public became acquainted with the article the patentee would raise the price similar examples of combination seem not to be unfrequent as appears by the report of the committee of the house of commons on patents for inventions june see the evidence of mr holdsworth  there occurs another kind of combination against the public with which it is difficult to deal it usually ends in a monopoly and the public are then left to the discretion of the monopolists not to charge them above the growling pointthat is not to make them pay so much as to induce them actually to combine against the imposition this occurs when two companies supply water or gas to consumers by means of pipes laid down under the pavement in the street of cities it may possibly occur also in docks canals railroads etc and in other cases where the capital required is very large and the competition very limited if water or gas companies combine the public immediately loses all the advantage of competition and it has generally happened that at the end of a period during which they have undersold each other the several companies have agreed to divide the whole district supplied into two or more parts each company then removing its pipes from all the streets except those in its own portion this removal causes great injury to the pavement and when the pressure of increased rates induces a new company to start the same inconvenience is again produced perhaps one remedy against evils of this kind might be when a charter is granted to such companies to restrict to a certain amount the rate of profit on the shares and to direct that any profits beyond shall accumulate for the repayment of the original capital this has been done in several late acts of parliament establishing companies the maximum rate of profit allowed ought to be liberal to compensate for the risk; the public ought to have auditors on their part and the accounts should be annually published for the purpose of preventing the limitations from being exceeded it must however be admitted that this would be an interference with capital which if allowed should in the present state of our knowledge be examined with great circumspection in each individual case until some general principle is established on welladmitted grounds  an instrument called a gasmeter which ascertains the quantity of gas used by each consumer has been introduced and furnishes a satisfactory mode of determining the payments to be made by individuals to the gas companies a contrivance somewhat similar in its nature might be used for the sale of water; but in that case some public inconvenience might be apprehended from the diminished quantity which would then run to waste the streams of water running through the sewers in london are largely supplied from this source; and if this supply were diminished the drainage of the metropolis might be injuriously affected  in the north of england a powerful combination has long existed among the coalowners by which the public has suffered in the payment of increased price the late examination of evidence before a committee of the house of commons has explained its mode of operation and the committee have recommended that for the present the sale of coal should be left to the competition of other districts  a combination of another kind exists at this moment to a great extent and operates upon the price of the very pages which are now communicating information respecting it a subject so interesting to every reader and still more so to every manufacturer ofthe article which the reader consumes deserves an attentive examination we have shown in chapter xxi p the component parts of the expense of each copy of the present work; and we have seen that the total amount of the cost of its production exclusive of any payment to the author for his labour is s d* another fact with which the reader is more practically familiar is that he has paid or is to pay to his bookseller six shillings for the volume let us now examine into the distribution of these six shillings and then having the facts ofthe case before us we shall be better able to judgeofthe meritsofthe combinationjust mentioned andtoexplainits effects  distribution of the profits on a six shilling book  buys at; sells at; profit on capital expended s d; s d no ithe publisher who accounts to the author for every copy received; ; ; per cent no iithe bookseller who retails to the public; ; ;  or ; ; no i the publisher is a bookseller; he is in fact the author's agent his duties are to receive and take charge of the stock for which he supplies warehouse room; to advise the author about the times and methods of advertising; and to insert the advertisements as he publishes other books he will advertise lists of those sold by himself; and thus by combining many in one advertisement diminish the expense to each of his principals he pays the author only for the books actually sold; consequently he makes no outlav of capital except that which he pays for advertisements but he is answerable for any bad debts he may contract in disposing of them his charge is usually ten per cent on the returns no ii is the bookseller who retails the work to the public on the publication of a new book the publisher sends round to the trade to receive 'subscriptions' from them for any number of copies not less than two these copies are usually charged to the 'subscribers' on an average at about four or five per cent less than the wholesale price of the book in the present case the subscription price is s d for each copy after the day of publication the price charged by the publisher to the booksellers is s d with some works it is the custom to deliver twentyfive copies to those who order twentyfour thus allowing a reduction of about four per cent such was the case with the present volume different publishers offer different terms to the subscribers; and it is usual after intervals of about six months for the publisher again to open a subscription list so that if the work be one for which there is a steady sale the trade avail themselves of these opportunities of purchasing at the reduced rate enough to supply their probable demand*  the volume thus purchased of the publisher at s d or s d is retailed by the bookseller to the public at s in the first case he makes a profit of fortyfour in the second of thirtythree per cent even the smaller of these two rates of profit on the capital employed appears to be much too large it may sometimes happen that when a book is enquired for the retail dealer sends across the street to the wholesale agent and receives for this trifling service one fourth part of the money paid by the purchaser; and perhaps the retail dealer takes also six months' credit for the price which the volume actually cost him  in section the price of each process in manufacturing the present volume was stated we shall now give an analysis of the whole expense of conveying it into the hands of the public  the retail price s on produces total expense of printing and paper taxes on paper and advertisements commission to publisher as agent between author and printer commission to publisher as agent for sale of the book profitthe difference between subscription price and trade price d per vol profit the difference between trade price and retail price s d per vol    remains for authorship total this account appears to disagree with that in page but it will be observed that the three first articles amount to l s the sum there stated the apparent difference arises from a circumstance which was not noticed in the first edition of this work the bill amounting to l s as there given and as reprinted in the present volume included an additional charge of ten per cent upon the real charges of the printer and papermaker  it is usual for the publisher when he is employed as agent between the author and printer to charge a commission of ten per cent on all payments he makes if the author is informed of this custom previously to his commencing the work as was the case in the present instance he can have no just cause of complaint; for it is optional whether he himself employs the printer or communicates with him through the intervention of his publisher the services rendered for this payment are the making arrangements with the printer the woodcutter and the engraver if required there is a convenience in having some intermediate person between the author and printer in case the former should consider any of the charges made by the latter as too high when the author himself is quite unacquainted with the details of the art of printing he may object to charges which on a better acquaintance with the subject he might be convinced were very moderate; and in such cases he ought to depend on the judgement of his publisher who is generally conversant with the art this is particularly the case in the charge for alterations and corrections some of which although apparently trivial occupy the compositors much time in making it should also be observed that the publisher in this case becomes responsible for the payments to those persons  it is not necessary that the author should avail himself of this intervention although it is the interest of the publisher that he should; and booksellers usually maintain that the author cannot procure his paper or printing at a cheaper rate if he go at once to the producers this appears from the evidence given before the committee of the house of commons in the copyright acts may  mr o rees bookseller of the house of longman and co paternoster row examined q suppose a gentleman to publish a work on his own account and to incur all the various expenses; could he get the paper at s a ream? a i presume not; i presume a stationer would not sell the paper at the same price to an indifferent gentleman as to the trade q the committee asked you if a private gentleman was to publish a work on his own account if he would not pay more for the paper than persons in the trade; the committee wish to be informed whether a printer does not charge a gentleman a higher rate than to a publisher a i conceive they generally charge a profit on the paper q do not the printers charge a higher price also for printing than they do to the trade? a i always understood that they do  there appears to be little reason for this distinction in charging for printing a larger price to the author than to the publisher provided the former is able to give equal security for the payment with respect to the additional charge on paper if the author employs either publisher or printer to purchase it they ought to receive a moderate remuneration for the risk since they become responsible for the payment; but there is no reason why if the author deals at once with the papermaker he should not purchase on the same terms as the printer; and if he choose by paying ready money not to avail himself of the long credit allowed in those trades he ought to procure his paper considerably cheaper  it is time however that such conventional combinations between different trades should be done away with in a country so eminently depending for its wealth on its manufacturing industry it is of importance that there should exist no abrupt distinction of classes and that the highest of the aristocracy should feel proud of being connected either personally or through their relatives with those pursuits on which their country's greatness depends the wealthier manufacturers and merchants already mix with those classes and the larger and even the middling tradesmen are frequently found associating with the gentry of the land it is good that this ambition should be cultivated not by any rivalry in expense but by a rivalry in knowledge and in liberal feelings; and few things would more contribute to so desirable an effect than the abolition of all such contracted views as those to which we have alluded the advantage to the other classes would be an increased acquaintance with the productive arts of the country an increased attention to the importance of acquiring habits of punctuality and of business and above all a general feeling that it is honourable in any rank of life to increase our own and our country's riches by employing our talents in the production or in the distribution of wealth  another circumstance omitted to be noticed in the first edition relates to what is technically called the overplus which may be now explained when copies of a work are to be printed each sheet of it requires one ream of paper now a ream as used by printers consists of  quires or sheets this excess of sixteen sheets is necessary in order to allow for 'revises'for preparing and adjusting the press for the due performance of its work and to supply the place of any sheets which may be accidentally dirtied or destroyed in the processes of printing or injured by the binder in putting into boards it is found however that three per cent is more than the proportion destroyed and that damage is less frequent in proportion to the skill and care of the workmen from the evidence of several highly respectable booksellers and printers before the committee of the house of commons on the copyright act may it appears that the average number of surplus copies above is between two and three; that on smaller impressions it is less whilst on larger editions it is greater; that in some instances the complete number of is not made up in which case the printer is obliged to pay for completing it; and that in no instance have the whole sixteen extra copies been completed on the volume in the reader's hands the edition of which consisted of the surplus amounted to fiftytwoa circumstance arising from the improvements in printing and the increased care of the pressmen now this overplus ought to be accounted for to the authorand i believe it usually is so by all respectable publishers  in order to prevent the printer from privately taking off a larger number of impressions than he delivers to the author or publisher various expedients have been adopted in some works a particular watermark has been used in paper made purposely for the book thus the words 'mecanique celeste' appear in the watermark of the two first volumes of the great work of laplace in other cases where the work is illustrated by engravings such a fraud would be useless without the concurrence of the copperplate printer in france it is usual to print a notice on the back of the title page that no copies are genuine without the subjoined signature of the author and attached to this notice is the author's name either written or printed by hand from a wooden block but notwithstanding this precaution i have recently purchased a volume printed at paris in which the notice exists but no signature is attached in london there is not much danger of such frauds because the printers are men of capital to whom the profit on such a transaction would be trifling and the risk of the detection of a fact which must of necessity be known to many of their workmen would be so great as to render the attempt at it folly  perhaps the best advice to an author if he publishes on his own account and is a reasonable person possessed of common sense would be to go at once to a respectable printer and make his arrangements with him  if the author do not wish to print his work at his own risk then he should make an agreement with a publisher for an edition of a limited number; but he should by no means sell the copyright if the work contains woodcuts or engravings it would be judicious to make it part of the contract that they shall become the author's property with the view to their use in a subsequent edition of the works if they should be required an agreement is frequently made by which the publisher advances the money and incurs all the risk on condition of his sharing the profits with the author the profits alluded to are for the present work the last item of section or l s  having now explained all the arrangements in printing the present volume let us return to section and examine the distribution of the l paid by the public of this sum l was the cost of the book l was taxes l was the charges of the bookseller in conveying it to the consumer and l remained for authorship the largest portion or l goes into the pockets of the booksellers; and as they do not advance capital and incur very little risk this certainly appears to be an unreasonable allowance the most extravagant part of the charge is the thirtythree per cent which is allowed as profit on retailing the book it is stated however that all retail booksellers allow to their customers a discount of ten per cent upon orders above s and that consequently the nominal profit of fortyfour or thirtythree per cent is very much reduced if this is the case it may fairly be enquired why the price of l for example is printed upon the back of a book when every bookseller is ready to sell it at l s and why those who are unacquainted with that circumstance should be made to pay more than others who are better informed?  several reasons have been alleged as justifying this high rate of profit first it has been alleged that the purchasers of books take long credit this probably is often the case and admitting it no reasonable person can object to a proportionate increase of price but it is no less clear that persons who do pay ready money should not be charged the same price as those who defer their payments to a remote period secondly it has been urged that large profits are necessary to pay for the great expenses of bookselling establishments; that rents are high and taxes heavy; and that it would be impossible for the great booksellers to compete with the smaller ones unless the retail profits were great in reply to this it may be observed that the booksellers are subject to no peculiar pressure which does not attach to all other retail trades it may also be remarked that large establishments always have advantages over smaller ones in the economy arising from the division of labour; and it is scarcely to be presumed that booksellers are the only class who in large concerns neglect to avail themselves of them thirdly it has been pretended that this high rate of profit is necessary to cover the risk of the bookseller's having some copies left on his shelves; but he is not obliged to buy of the publisher a single copy more than he has orders for and if he do purchase more at the subscription price he proves by the very fact that he himself does not estimate that risk at more than from four to eight per cent  it has been truly observed on the other hand that many copies of books are spoiled by persons who enter the shops of booksellers without intending to make any purchase but not to mention that such persons finding on the tables various new publications are frequently induced by that opportunity of inspecting them to become purchasers this damage does not apply to all booksellers nor to all books; of course it is not necessary to keep in the shop books of small probable demand or great price in the present case the retail profit on three copies only namely s d would pay the whole cost of the one copy soiled in the shop; and even that copy might afterwards produce at an auction half or a third of its cost price the argument therefore from disappointments in the sale of books and that arising from heavy stock are totally groundless in the question between publisher and author it shold be remarked also that the publisher is generally a retail as well as a wholesale bookseller; and that besides his profit upon every copy which he sells in his capacity of agent he is allowed to charge the author as if every copy had been subscribed for at s d and of course he receives the same profit as the rest of the wholesale traders for the books retailed in his own shop  in the country there is more reason for a considerable allowance between the retail dealer and the public; because the profit of the country bookseller is diminished by the expense of the carriage of the books from london he must also pay a commission usually five per cent to his london agent on all those books which his correspondent does not himself publish if to this be added a discount of five per cent allowed for ready money to every customer and of ten per cent to book clubs the profit of the bookseller in a small country town is by no means too large some of the writers who have published criticisms on the observations made in the first edition of this work have admitted that the apparent rate of profit to the booksellers is too large but they have on the other hand urged that too favourable a case is taken in supposing the whole copies sold if the reader will turn back to section he will find that the expense of the three first items remains the same whatever be the number of copies sold; and on looking over the remaining items he will perceive that the bookseller who incurs very little risk and no outlay derives exactly the same profit per cent on the copies sold whatever their numbers may be this however is not the case with the unfortunate author on whom nearly the whole of the loss falls undivided the same writers have also maintained that the profit is fixed at the rate mentioned in order to enable the bookseller to sustain losses unavoidably incurred in the purchase and retail of other books this is the weakest of all arguments it would be equally just that a merchant should charge an extravagant commission for an undertaking unaccompanied with any risk in order to repay himself for the losses which his own want of skill might lead to in his other mercantile transactions  that the profit in retailing books is really too large is proved by several circumstances first that the same nominal rate of profit has existed in the bookselling trade for a long series of years notwithstanding the great fluctuations in the rate of profit on capital invested in every other business secondly that until very lately a multitude of booksellers in all parts of london were content with a much smaller profit and were willing to sell for ready money or at short credit to persons of undoubted character at a profit of only ten per cent and in some instances even at a still smaller percentage instead of that of twentyfive per cent on the published prices thirdly that they are unable to maintain this rate of profit except by a combination the object of which is to put down all competition  some time ago a small number of the large london booksellers entered into such a combination one of their objects was to prevent any bookseller from selling books for less than ten per cent under the published prices; and in order to enforce this principle they refuse to sell books except at the publishing price to any bookseller who declines signing an agreement to that effect by degrees many were prevailed upon to join this combination; and the effect of the exclusion it inflicted left the small capitalist no option between signing or having his business destroyed ultimately nearly the whole trade comprising about two thousand four hundred persons have been compelled to sign the agreement as might be naturally expected from a compact so injurious to many of the parties to it disputes have arisen; several booksellers have been placed under the ban of the combination who allege that they have not violated its rules and who accuse the opposite party of using spies etc to entrap them*  the origin of this combination has been explained by mr pickering of chancery lane himself a publisher in a printed statement entitled 'booksellers' monopoly' and the following list of booksellers who form the committee for conducting this combination is copied from that printed at the head of each of the cases published by mr pickering  allen j leadenhall street arch j cornhill baldwin r paternoster row booth j duncan j paternoster row hatchard j piccadilly marshall r stationers' court murray j albemarle street rees o paternoster row richardson j m cornhill rivington j st paul's churchyard wilson e royal exchange  in whatever manner the profits are divided between the publisher and the retail bookseller the fact remains that the reader pays for the volume in his hands s and that the author will receive only s d; out of which latter sum the expense of printing the volume must be paid so that in passing through two hands this book has produced a profit of fortyfour per cent this excessive rate of profit has drawn into the book trade a larger share of capital than was really advantageous; and the competition between the different portions of that capital has naturally led to the system of underselling to which the committee above mentioned are endeavouring to put a stop*  there are two parties who chiefly suffer from this combination the public and authors the first party can seldom be induced to take an active part against any grievance; and in fact little is required from it except a cordial support of the authors in any attempt to destroy a combination so injurious to the interests of both many an industrious bookseller would be glad to sell for s the volume which the reader holds in his hand and for which he has paid s; and in doing so for ready money the tradesman who paid s d for the book would realize without the least risk a profit of eleven per cent on the money he had advanced it is one of the objects of the combination we are discussing to prevent the small capitalist from employing his capital at that rate of profit which he thinks most advantageous to himself; and such a proceeding is decidedly injurious to the public  having derived little pecuniary advantage from my own literary productions; and being aware that from the very nature of their subjects they can scarcely be expected to reimburse the expense of preparing them i may be permitted to offer an opinion upon the subject which i believe to be as little influenced by any expectation of advantage from the future as it is by any disappointment at the past before however we proceed to sketch the plan of a campaign against paternoster row it will be fit to inform the reader of the nature of the enemies' forces and of his means of attack and defence several of the great publishers find it convenient to be the proprietors of reviews magazines journals and even of newspapers the editors are paid in some instances very handsomely for their superintendence; and it is scarcely to be expected that they should always mete out the severest justice on works by the sale of which their employers are enriched the great and popular works of the day are of course reviewed with some care and with deference to public opinion without this the journals would not sell; and it is convenient to be able to quote such articles as instances of impartiality under shelter of this a host of ephemeral productions are written into a transitory popularity; and by the aid of this process the shelves of the booksellers as well as the pockets of the public are disencumbered to such an extent are these means employed that some of the periodical publications of the day ought to be regarded merely as advertising machines that the reader may be in some measure on his guard against such modes of influencing his judgement he should examine whether the work reviewed is published by the bookseller who is the proprietor of the review; a fact which can sometimes be ascertained from the title of the book as given at the head of the article but this is by no means a certain criterion because partnerships in various publications exist between houses in the book trade which are not generally known to the public; so that in fact until reviews are established in which booksellers have no interest they can never be safely trusted  in order to put down the combination of booksellers no plan appears so likely to succeed as a counterassociation of authors if any considerable portion of the literary world were to unite and form such an association; and if its affairs were directed by an active committee much might be accomplished the objects of such an union should be to employ some person well skilled in the printing and in the bookselling trade; and to establish him in some central situation as their agent each member of the association to be at liberty to place any or all of his works in the hands of this agent for sale; to allow any advertisements or list of books published by members of the association to be stitched up at the end of each of his own productions; the expense of preparing them being defrayed by the proprietors of the books advertised the duties of the agent would be to retail to the public for ready money copies of books published by members of the association to sell to the trade at prices agreed upon any copies they may require to cause to be inserted in the journals or at the end of works published by members any advertisements which the committee or authors may direct to prepare a general catalogue of the works of members to be the agent for any member of the association respecting the printing of any work such a union would naturally present other advantages; and as each author would retain the liberty of putting any price he might think fit on his productions the public would have the advantage of reduction in price produced by competition between authors on the same subject as well as of that arising from a cheaper mode of publishing the volumes sold to them  possibly one of the consequences resulting from such an association would be the establishment of a good and an impartial review a work the want of which has been felt for several years the two longestablished and celebrated reviews the unbending champions of the most opposite political opinions are from widely differing causes exhibiting unequivocal signs of decrepitude and decay the quarterly advocate of despotic principles is fast receding from the advancing intelligence of the age; the new strength and new position which that intelligence has acquired demands for its expression new organs equally the representatives of its intellectual power and of its moral energies whilst on the other hand the sceptre of the northern critics has passed from the vigorous grasp of those who established its dominion into feebler hands  it may be stated as a difficulty in realizing this suggestion that those most competent to supply periodical criticism are already engaged but it is to be observed that there are many who now supply literary criticisms to journals the political principles of which they disapprove; and that if once a respectable and wellsupported review* were established capable of competing in payment to its contributors with the wealthiest of its rivals it would very soon be supplied with the best materials the country can produce * it may also be apprehended that such a combination of authors would be favourable to each other there are two temptations to which an editor of a review is commonly exposed the first is a tendency to consult too much in the works he criticizes the interest of the proprietor of his review; the second a similar inclination to consult the interests of his friends the plan which has been proposed removes one of these temptations but it would be very difficult if not impossible to destroy the other notes  the whole of the subsequent details relate to the first edition of this work  these details vary with different books and different publishers; those given in the text are believed to substantially correct and are applicable to works like the present  it is now understood that the use of spies has been given up; and it is also known that the system of underselling is again privately resorted to by many so that the injury arising from this arbitrary system pursued by the great booksellers affects only or most severely those whose adherence to an extorted promise most deserves respect note to the second edition  the monopoly cases nos  and of those published by mr pickering should be consulted upon this point; and as the public will be better able to form a judgement by hearing the other side of the question it is to be hoped the chairman of the committee mr richardson will publish those regulations respecting the trade a copy of which mr pickering states is refused by the committee even to those who sign them  at the moment when this opinion as to the necessity for a new review was passing through the press i was informed that the elements of such an undertaking were already organized  i have been suggested to me that the doctrines maintained in this chapter may subject the present volume to the opposition of that combination which it has opposed i do not entertain that opinion; and for this reason that the booksellers are too shrewd a class to supply such an admirable passport to publicity as their opposition would prove to be if generally suspected but should my readers take a different view of the question they can easily assist in remedying the evil by each mentioning the existence of this little volume to two of his friends i was wrong in this conjecture; all booksellers are not so shrewd as i had imagined for some did refuse to sell this volume; consequently others sold a larger number of copies in the preface to the second edition at the commencement of this volume the reader will find some further observation on the effect of the booksellers' combination  chapter  on the effect of machinery in reducing the demand for labour  one of the objections most frequently urged against machinery is that it has a tendency to supersede much of the hand labour which was previously employed; and in fact unless a machine diminished the labour necessary to make an article it could never come into use but if it have that effect its owner in order to extend the sale of his produce will be obliged to undersell his competitors; this will induce them also to introduce the new machine and the effect of this competition will soon cause the article to fall until the profits on capital under the new system shall be reduced to the same rate as under the old although therefore the use of machinery has at first a tendency to throw labour out of employment yet the increased demand consequent upon the reduced price almost immediately absorbs a considerable portion of that labour and perhaps in some cases the whole of what would otherwise have been displaced that the effect of a new machine is to diminish the labour required for the production of the same quantity of manufactured commodities may be clearly perceived by imagining a society in which occupations are not divided each man himself manufacturing all the articles he consumes supposing each individual to labour during ten hours daily one of which is devoted to making shoes it is evident that if any tool or machine be introduced by the use of which his shoes can be made in half the usual time then each member of the community will enjoy the same comforts as before by only nine and onehalf hours' labour  if therefore we wish to prove that the total quantity of labour is not diminished by the introduction of machines we must have recourse to some other principle of our nature but the same motive which urges a man to activity will become additionally powerful when he finds his comforts procured with diminished labour; and in such circumstances it is probable that many would employ the time thus redeemed in contriving new tools for other branches of their occupations he who has habitually worked ten hours a day will employ the half hour saved by the new machine in gratifying some other want; and as each new machine adds to these gratifications new luxuries will open to his view which continued enjoyment will as surely render necessary to his happiness  in countries where occupations are divided and where the division of labour is practised the ultimate consequence of improvements in machinery is almost invariably to cause a greater demand for labour frequently the new labour requires at its commencement a higher degree of skill than the old; and unfortunately the class of persons driven out of the old employment are not always qualified for the new one; so that a certain interval must elapse before the whole of their labour is wanted this for a time produces considerable suffering amongst the working classes; and it is of great importance for their happiness that they should be aware of these effects and be enabled to foresee them at an early period in order to diminish as much as possible the injury resulting from them  one very important enquiry which this subject presents is the question whether it is more for the interest of the working classes that improved machinery should be so perfect as to defy the competition of hand labour; and that they should thus be at once driven out of the trade by it; or be gradually forced to quit it by the slow and successive advances of the machine? the suffering which arises from a quick transition is undoubtedly more intense; but it is also much less permanent than that which results from the slower process and if the competition is perceived to be perfectly hopeless the workman will at once set himself to learn a new department of his art on the other hand although new machinery causes an increased demand for skill in those who make and repair it and in those who first superintend its use; yet there are other cases in which it enables children and inferior workmen to execute work that previously required greater skill in such circumstances even though the increased demand for the article produced by its diminished price should speedily give occupation to all who were before employed yet the very diminution of the skill required would open a wider field of competition amongst the working classes themselves that machines do not even at their first introduction invariably throw human labour out of employment must be admitted; and it has been maintained by persons very competent to form an opinion on the subject that they never produce that effect the solution of this question depends on facts which unfortunately have not yet been collected and the circumstance of our not possessing the data necessary for the full examination of so important a subject supplies an additional reason for impressing upon the minds of all who are interested in such enquiries the importance of procuring accurate registries at various times of the number of persons employed in particular branches of manufacture of the number of machines used by them and of the wages they receive  in relation to the enquiry just mentioned i shall offer some remarks upon the facts within my knowledge; and only regret that those which i can support by numerical statement are so few when the crushing mill used in cornwall and other mining countries superseded the labour of a great number of young women who worked very hard in breaking ores with flat hammers no distress followed the reason of this appears to have been that the proprietors of the mines having one portion of their capital released by the superior cheapness of the process executed by the mills found it their interest to apply more labour to other operations the women disengaged from mere drudgery were thus profitably employed in dressing the ores a work which required skill and judgement in the selection  the increased production arising from alterations in the machinery or from improved modes of using it appears from the following table a machine called in the cotton manufacture a 'stretcher' worked by one man produced as follows  year; pounds of cotton spun; roving wages per score; rate of earning per week   s d s d  *    the same man working at another stretcher the roving a little finer produced      in this instance production has gradually increased until at the end of twentytwo years three times as much work is done as at the commencement although the manual labour employed remains the same the weekly earnings of the workmen have not fluctuated very much and appear on the whole to have advanced but it would be imprudent to push too far reasonings founded upon a single instance  the produce of spindles of 'mule yarn spinning' at different periods was as follows year; hanks about to the pound; wages per thousand s d ; ;  ; ;  ; ; the subjoined view of the state of weaving by hand and by powerlooms at stockport in the years and is taken from an enumeration of the machines contained in factories and was collected for the purpose of being given in evidence before a committee of the house of commons     in  in  handloom weavers     decrease persons using powerlooms   increase persons to dress the warp    increase total persons employed    increase powerlooms     increase during this period the number of handlooms in employment has diminished to less than onethird whilst that of powerlooms has increased to more than five times its former amount the total number of workmen has increased about onethird; but the amount of manufactured goods supposing each powerloom to do only the work of three handlooms is three and a half times as large as it was before  in considering this increase of employment it must be admitted that the two thousand persons thrown out of work are not exactly of the same class as those called into employment by the powerlooms a handweaver must possess bodily strength which is not essential for a person attending a powerloom; consequently women and young persons of both sexes from fifteen to seventeen years of age find employment in powerloom factories this however would be a very limited view of the employment arising from the introduction of powerlooms the skill called into action in building the new factories in constructing the new machinery in making the steamengines to drive it and in devising improvements in the structure of the looms as well as in regulating the economy of the establishment is of a much higher order than that which it had assisted in superseding; and if we possessed any means of measuring this it would probably be found larger in amount nor in this view of the subject must we omit the fact that although handlooms would have increased in number if those moved by steam had not been invented yet it is the cheapness of the article manufactured by powerlooms which has caused this great extension of their employment and that by diminishing the price of one article of commerce we always call into additional activity the energy of those who produce others it appears that the number of handlooms in use in england and scotland in was about ; nearly the same number existed in the year whereas the number of powerlooms which in was had in been when it is considered that each of these powerlooms did as much work as three worked by hand the increased producing power was equal to that of handlooms during the whole of this period the wages and employment of handloom weavers have been very precarious  increased intelligence amongst the working classes may enable them to foresee some of those improvements which are likely for a time to affect the value of their labour; and the assistance of savings banks and friendly societies the advantages of which can never be too frequently or too strongly pressed upon their attention may be of some avail in remedying the evil but it may be useful also to suggest to them that a diversity of employments amongst the members of one family will tend in some measure to mitigate the privations which arise from fluctuation in the value of labour notes  in the workman's wages were guaranteed not to be less than s  chapter  on the effect of taxes and of legal restrictions upon manufactures  as soon as a tax is put upon any article the ingenuity of those who make and of those who use it is directed to the means of evading as large a part of the tax as they can; and this may often be accomplished in ways which are perfectly fair and legal an excise duty exists at present of d* per pound upon all writing paper the effect of this impost is that much of the paper which is employed is made extremely thin in order that the weight of a given number of sheets may be as small as possible soon after the first imposition of the tax upon windows which depended upon their number and not upon their size newbuilt houses began to have fewer windows and those of larger dimensions than before staircases were lighted by extremely long windows illuminating three or four flights of stairs when the tax was increased and the size of windows charged as single was limited then still greater care was taken to have as few windows as possible and internal lights became frequent these internal lights in their turn became the subject of taxation; but it was easy to evade the discovery of them and in the last act of parliament reducing the assessed taxes they ceased to be chargeable from the changes thus successively introduced in the number the forms and the positions of the windows a tolerable conjecture might in some instances be formed of the age of a house  a tax on windows is exposed to objection on the double ground of its excluding air and light and it is on both accounts injurious to health the importance of light to the enjoyment of health is not perhaps sufficiently appreciated in the cold and more variable climates it is of still greater importance than in warmer countries  the effects of regulations of excise upon our home manufactures are often productive of great inconvenience; and check materially the natural progress of improvement it is frequently necessary for the purposes of revenue to oblige manufacturers to take out a license and to compel them to work according to certain rules and to make certain stated quantities at each operation when these quantities are large as in general they are they deter manufacturers from making experiments and thus impede improvements both in the mode of conducting the processes and in the introduction of new materials difficulties of this nature have occurred in experimenting upon glass for optical purposes; but in this case permission has been obtained by fit persons to make experiments without the interference of the excise it ought however to be remembered that such permission if frequently or indiscriminately granted might be abused the greatest protection against such an abuse will be found in bringing the force of public opinion to bear upon scientific men and thus enabling the proper authorities although themselves but moderately conversant with science to judge of the propriety of the permission from the public character of the applicant  from the evidence given in before the committee of the house of commons on distillation from sugar and molasses it appeared that by a different mode of working from that prescribed by the excise the spirits from a given weight of corn which then produced eighteen gallons might easily have been increased to twenty gallons nothing more is required for this purpose than to make what is called the wash weaker the consequence of which is that fermentation goes on to a greater extent it was stated however that such a deviation would render the collection of the duty liable to great difficulties; and that it would not benefit the distiller much since his price was enhanced to the customer by any increase of expense in the fabrication here then is a case in which a quantity amounting to oneninth of the total produce is actually lost to the country a similar effect arises in the coal trade from the effect of a duty for according to the evidence before the house of commons it appears that a considerable quantity of the very best coal is actually wasted the extent of this waste is very various in different mines; but in some cases it amounts to onethird  the effects of duties upon the import of foreign manufactures are equally curious a singular instance occurred in the united states where bariron was on its introduction liable to a duty of per cent ad valorem whilst hardware was charged at per cent only in consequence of this tax large quantities of malleable iron rails for railroads were imported into america under the denomination of hardware; the difference of per cent in duty more than counter balancing the expense of fashioning the iron into rails prior to its importation  duties drawbacks and bounties when considerable in amount are all liable to objections of a very serious nature from the frauds to which they give rise it has been stated before committees of the house of commons that calicoes made up in the form and with the appearance of linen have frequently been exported for the purpose of obtaining the bounty for calico made up in this way sells only at s d per yard whereas linen of equal fineness is worth from s d to s d per yard it appeared from the evidence that one house in six months sold five hundred such pieces of calico in almost all cases heavy duties or prohibitions are ineffective as well as injurious; for unless the articles excluded are of very large dimensions there constantly arises a price at which they will be clandestinely imported by the smuggler the extent therefore to which smuggling can be carried should always be considered in the imposition of new duties or in the alteration of old ones unfortunately it has been pushed so far and is so systematically conducted between this country and france that the price per cent at which most contraband articles can be procured is perfectly well known from the evidence of mr galloway it appears that from to per cent was the rate of insurance on exporting prohibited machinery from england and that the larger the quantity the less was the percentage demanded from evidence given in the report of the watch and clockmakers' committee in it appears that persons were constantly in the habit of receiving in france watches lace silks and other articles of value easily portable and delivering them in england at ten per cent on their estimated worth in which sum the cost of transport and the risk of smuggling were included  the process employed in manufacturing often depends upon the mode in which a tax is levied on the materials or on the article produced w atch glasses are made in england by workmen who purchase from the glass house globes of five or six inches in diameter out of which by means of a piece of redhot tobacco pipe guided round a pattern watch glass placed on the globe they crack five others these are afterwards ground and smoothed on the edges in the tyrol the rough watch glasses are supplied at once from the glass house; the workman applying a thick ring of cold glass to each globe as soon as it is blown causes a piece of the size of a watch glass to be cracked out the remaining portion of the globe is immediately broken and returns to the melting pot this process could not be adopted in england with the same economy because the whole of the glass taken out of the pot is subject to the excise duty  the objections thus stated as incidental to particular modes of taxation are not raised with a view to the removal of those particular taxes; their fitness or unfitness must be decided by a much wider enquiry into which it is not the object of this volume to enter taxes are essential for the security both of liberty and property and the evils which have been mentioned may be the least amongst those which might have been chosen it is however important that the various effects of every tax should be studied and that those should be adopted which upon the whole are found to give the least check to the productive industry of the country  in enquiring into the effect produced or to be apprehended from any particular mode of taxation it is necessary to examine a little into the interests of the parties who approve of the plan in question as well as of those who object to it instances have occurred where the persons paying a tax into the hands of government have themselves been adverse to any reduction this happened in the case of one class of calicoprinters whose interest really was injured by a removal of the tax on the printing they received from the manufacturers payment for the duty about two months before they were themselves called on to pay it to government; and the consequence was that a considerable capital always remained in their hands the evidence which states this circumstance is well calculated to promote a reasonable circumspection in such enquiries question do you happen to know anything of an opposition from calico printers to the repeal of the tax on printed calicoes? answer i have certainly heard of such an opposition and am not surprised at it there are very few individuals who are in fact interested in the nonrepeal of the tax; there are two classes of calicoprinters; one who print their own cloth send their goods into the market and sell them on their own account; they frequently advance the duty to government and pay it in cash before their goods are sold but generally before the goods are paid for being most commonly sold on a credit of six months they are of course interested on that account as well as on others that have been stated in the repeal of the tax the other class of calicoprinters print the cloth of other people; they print for hire and on redelivery of the cloth when printed they receive the amount of the duty which they are not called upon to pay to government sooner on an average than nine weeks from the stamping of the goods where the business is carried on upon a large scale the arrears of duty due to government often amount to eight or even ten thousand pounds and furnish a capital with which these gentlemen carry on their business; it is not therefore to be wondered at that they should be opposed to the prayer of our petition  the policy of giving bounties upon home productions and of enforcing restrictions against those which can be produced more cheaply in other countries is of a very questionable nature and except for the purpose of introducing a new manufacture in a country where there is not much commercial or manufacturing spirit is scarcely to be defended all incidental modes of taxing one class of the community the consumers to an unknown extent for the sake of supporting another class the manufacturers who would otherwise abandon that mode of employing their capital are highly objectionable one part of the price of any article produced under such circumstances consists of the expenditure together with the ordinary profits of capital the other part of its price may be looked upon as charity given to induce the manufacturer to continue an unprofitable use of his capital in order to give employment to his workmen if the sum of what the consumers are thus forced to pay merely on account of these artificial restrictions where generally known its amount would astonish even those who advocate them; and it would be evident to both parties that the employment of capital in those branches of trade ought to be abandoned  the restriction of articles produced in a manufactory to certain sizes is attended with some good effect in an economical view arising chiefly from the smaller number of different tools required in making them as well as from less frequent change in the adjustment of those tools a similar source of economy is employed in the navy by having ships divided into a certain number of classes each of which comprises vessels of the same dimensions the rigging made for one vessel will fit any other of its class; a circumstance which renders the supply of distant stations more easy  the effects of the removal of a monopoly are often very important and they were perhaps never more remarkable than in the bobbin net trade in the years and these effects were however considerably enhanced by the general rage for speculation which was so prevalent during that singular period one of the patents of mr heathcote for a bobbin net machine had just then expired whilst another for an improvement in a particular part of such machines called a turn again had yet a few years to run many licenses had been granted to use the former patent which were charged at the rate of about five pounds per annum for each quarter of a yard in width so that what is termed a sixquarter frame which makes bobbin net a yard and a half wide paid thirty pounds a year the second patent was ultimately abandoned in august infringements of it having taken place it was not surprising that on the removal of the monopoly arising from this patent a multitude of persons became desirous of embarking in a trade which had hitherto yielded a very large profit the bobbin net machine occupies little space; and is from that circumstance well adapted for a domestic manufacture the machines which already existed were principally in the hands of the manufacturers; but a kind of mania for obtaining them seized on persons of all descriptions who could raise a small capital; and under its influence butchers bakers small farmers publicans gentlemen's servants and in some cases even clergymen became anxious to possess bobbin net machines some few machines were rented; but in most of these cases the workman purchased the machine he employed by instalments of from l to l weekly for a six quarter machine; and many individuals unacquainted with the mode of using the machines so purchased paid others of more experience for instructing them in their use; l or l being sometimes given for this instruction the success of the first speculators induced others to follow the example; and the machinemakers were almost overwhelmed with orders for lace frames such was the desire to procure them that many persons deposited a large part or the whole of the price in the hands of the framemakers in order to insure their having the earliest supply this as might naturally be expected raised the price of wages amongst the workmen employed in machinemaking; and the effect was felt at a considerable distance from nottingham which was the centre of this mania smiths not used to flat filing coming from distant parts earned from s to s per week finishing smiths accustomed to the work gained from l to l per weekthe forging smith if accustomed to his work gained from l to l per week and some few earned l per week in making what are technically called insides those who were best paid were generally clock and watchmakers from all the districts round who received from l to l per week the settersuppersons who put the parts of the machine togethercharged l for their assistance; and a six quarter machine could be put together in a fortnight or three weeks  good workmen being thus induced to desert less profitable branches of their business in order to supply this extraordinary demand the masters in other trades soon found their men leaving them without being aware of the immediate reason some of the more intelligent however ascertained the cause they went from birmingham to nottingham in order to examine into the circumstances which had seduced almost all the journeymen clockmakers from their own workshops; and it was soon apparent that the men who had been working as clockmakers in birmingham at the rate of s a week could earn l by working at lace framemaking in nottingham on examining the nature of this profitable work the master clockmakers perceived that one part of the bobbin net machines that which held the bobbins could easily be made in their own workshops they therefore contracted with the machinemakers who had already more work ordered than they could execute to supply the bobbin carriers at a price which enabled them on their return home to give such increased wages as were sufficient to retain their own workmen as well as yield themselves a good profit thus an additional facility was afforded for the construction of these bobbin net machines and the conclusion was not difficult to be foreseen the immense supply of bobbin net thus poured into the market speedily reduced its price; this reduction in price rendered the machines by which the net was made less valuable; some few of the earliest producers for a short time carried on a profitable trade; but multitudes were disappointed and many ruined the low price at which the fabric sold together with its lightness and beauty combined to extend the sale; and ultimately new improvements in the machines rendered the older ones still less valuable oracle® java me embedded developer’s guide release e july this document is a resource for software developers

applications to the latest version of the oracle java me embedded runtime you can safely skip this chapter if you have not developed imlets using version or earlier of the oracle java me embedded platform topics • overview • modified permission model • device io namespace • generic connection framework changes overview java me is an umbrella terms for two new jsrs cldc and meep cldc is a major evolution of cldc while meep is a major evolution of impng java me also includes support for the new device io api cldc is backwards compatible with cldc but includes alignment with the java se and language core apis and vm functionality java sestyle classbased finegrain permissions as well as a significantly enhanced generic connection framework gcf meep allows execution of most impng applications and includes significant enhancements by leveraging the cldc features improvements in the application platform improved software provisioning and management footprint scalability through optional apis improved connectivity options and more flexible authentication and authorization mechanisms the device io api defines an api that allows java applications running on small embedded devices to access peripheral devices from a peripheral device external to the host device to a peripheral chip embedded in the host device it is strongly recommended that developers familiarize themselves with the cldc specification and api the meep specification and api and the device io api modified permission model there are a number of new permissions that object methods must obtain before they can successfully access peripherals these permissions are covered in more detail in chapter however developers should be aware of the following • java me now uses java sestyle classbased finegrain permissions developer migration guide • applications should request the jdkdiodevicemgmtpermission permission when accessing any devices connected to the board through protocols such as gpio ic spi or mmio in addition to the permissions required by the communication bus they are using • the syntax for the permissions request has changed the request now includes the device identifier and any specific actions that are requested if applicable device identifiers eg gpio spi are listed in the appropriate appendix of the getting started guide for that development board • a single request cannot be used for multiple devices; each permissions must be listed separately for example you cannot do the following midletpermission jdkdiogpiopinpermission gpiogpio open instead you must do this midletpermission jdkdiogpiopinpermission gpio open midletpermission jdkdiogpiopinpermission gpio open in some cases you can use an asterisk as a wildcard device io namespace the device access api of the oracle java me embedded platform is now referred to as the device io api and is no longer part of the comoracledeviceaccess package instead all classes now use the jdkdio namespace in addition • classes that contain peripheral have been changed to device so for example peripheralmanager has been replaced by devicemanager and peripheralpermission has been replaced by devicepermission • support now exists for pulse width modulation pwm on all platforms • almost all of the individual class methods are unchanged generic connection framework changes the impng javaxmicroedition classes are now replaced by the generic connection framework gcf with jsr and java me embedded profile classes meep with jsr there are a large number of changes that are included in these new profiles see the specification pages online for more information on each of these classes device io namespace developer’s guide java embedded vm proxy and console starting from version the oracle java me embedded software moves as much cpu intensive processing away from the embedded java vm as possible instead a separate application running on the host side interacts across the network with the internals of the java vm with this design the vm only sends lowlevel events to the host application such as state change information methods transition and objects information the information is then stored and analyzed on host side and the host application in turn provides the information to all external profilers monitors and managers external tools can treat the java se host application as if it was the vm itself besides performance and footprint goals this approach minimizes development efforts on porting different component communications to new physical transport such as usb serial or bluetooth instead this vm proxy application also known as the developer agent and the vm proxy channel becomes the intercomponent tool and javacall cldc meep jsrs and sdk components can all take advantage of it topics • design • starting the vm proxy on the desktop • vm proxy options • using the command line interface design the vm proxy uses a single transport connection to transmit all data for any subsystem see figure for an illustration of this design; the vm proxy is the middle component java embedded vm proxy and console figure vm proxy and agent design for java embedded be sure not to confuse the vm proxy with the vm agent the vm agent consists of native code and is located on the embedded device the vm proxy is written in java se and is launched on the desktop host the proxy also provides a software management swm api similar to the javaxmicroeditionswm package as declared in the java me embedded profile meep specification this api is an extension of the previous application management system ams api of previous versions of the oracle java me embedded platform and can be leveraged by me sdk ides and the cli to manage applications with any connected device the transport layer between the vm proxy desktop and the vm agent device is protocolagnostic by design however it is currently implemented for tcp serial com port and usb the transport can initiate connection establishment in any direction either from device to host or vise versa starting the vm proxy on the desktop to use the vm proxy extract the files from your copy of the oracle java me embedded zip archive on the windows desktop the vm proxy program is found as a jar file inside the util directory of the oracle java me embedded distribution named proxyjar you can start the vm proxy on the desktop host computer either in a server or a client mode as described below server mode connection the server mode is used by default in this mode the vm proxy must be started after the java runtime is started on the embedded board then do the following change to the util directory on your desktop host and enter the following command you should see an output similar to the following c\mydir\util> java jar proxyjar socket <raspberry pi ip address> channel closed > available trying to open socket connection with device <ip address> connected to the socket socketaddr=<ip address> port localport= debugger connection initialized client mode connection to switch to a client mode connection perform the following steps starting the vm proxy on the desktop developer’s guide edit the jwcpropertiesini file on the embedded board as follows • set the proxyconnectionmode property to the client value • set the proxyclientconnectionaddress property to the ip address of the host running the developer agent start the java runtime on the embedded board change to the lib directory on your desktop host and enter the following command you should see an output similar to the following c\mydir\util> java jar proxyjar starting with default parameters serversocketport jdbport channel closed > available waiting for device connections on port by default the proxy listens for cli connections at port on the host the port can be changed by passing the cliport option while launching the proxy vm proxy options the following options are available when starting the vm proxy using the java jar proxyjar command no options runs proxy with default transport the host opens a server socket and waits for a connection from the embedded device this means the java embedded runtime should be started on the device with its jwcpropertiesini file containing the following settings proxyconnectionmode=client proxyclientconncetionaddress=ip address of vm proxy socket <ipaddress> runs the proxy as a client this means that the device should open a server socket and wait for a connection from the host the java embedded runtime should be started on the device with its jwcpropertiesini file containing the following setting proxyconnectionmode=server serial <comport>  runs the proxy with a serial transport this means that the vm proxy communicates with device across the specified serial port debug  adds additional debugging information when the vm proxy is running i  runs cli in the command shell proxy in interactive mode cliacceptanyhost  accepts connections to cli from any host by default only localhost connections are accepted proxyhost <host address> specifies the http proxy address for outbound ip connections from the proxy proxyport <proxy port>  specifies the http proxy port for outbound ip connections from the proxy use the help proxy option to preview the list of the available options vm proxy options java embedded vm proxy and console using the command line interface once the vm proxy is running on the desktop you can use the ams cli the easiest way to do this is to start a putty executable on your desktop computer and connect to localhost at port this is shown in figure see the appropriate getting started guide for your embedded board for platformspecific information on using the command line interface figure putty configuration the window from port provides a commandline interface cli and is shown in figure using the command line interface developer’s guide figure commandline interface warning the commandline interface cli feature in this

accessing peripherals applications that require access to device io apis must request appropriate permissions in jad files for more information on using the device io apis please see the device io api specification and the associated javadocs at the following site httpdocsoraclecomjavame signing the application with api permissions first the jad file must have the proper api permissions here is how to sign the application both in netbeans and without an ide • in netbeans rightclick the project name and choose properties select application descriptor then in the resulting pane select api permissions click the add button and add the appropriate permissions as shown in figure click ok to close the project properties dialog figure adding permissions using the netbeans ide • if you are not using an ide you can manually modify the application descriptor file to contain the following permissions midletpermission comoraclediodevicemgmtpermission ** open method # signing application using the netbeans ide the netbeans ide enables developers both to sign the applications with a local certificate and upload the certificate on the device see the appropriate getting started guide for your embedded platform to learn how to use the netbeans ide to sign your application accessing peripherals developer’s guide method # signing application using a command line signing applications using a command line is the preferred route for applications that are widely distributed here are the instructions on how to setup a keystore with a local certificate that can be used to sign the applications generate a new selfsigned certificate with the following command on the desktop using the keytool that is shipped with the oracle java se jdk keytool genkey v alias mycert keystore mykeystoreks storepass spass keypass kpass validity keyalg rsa keysize dname cn=thehost this command generates a bit rsa key pair and a selfsigned certificate placing them in a new keystore with a keystore password of spass and a key password of kpass that is valid for days you can change both passwords as desired copy the certs directory from the board over to the desktop using an sftp client or scp command change into the certs directory and perform the following command using the mekeytoolexe command or alternatively java jar mekeytooljar if your distribution contains only that that ships with the oracle java me sdk distribution mekeytool import mekeystore mainks keystore mykeystoreks storepass spass alias mycert domain trusted this command imports the information in mykeystoreks that you just created to the mainks keystore after this is completed copy the certs directory back to the board by using an sftp client or scp command use the following commands to sign your application before deploying it to the board jadtool addcert chainnum alias myalias keystore mykeystoreks storepass spass inputkad myjadjad outputjad myjadjad to sign with the sha signature algorithm add the usesha parameter if not present the default algorithm shawithrsa is used jadtool addjarsig chainnum jarfile myjarjar alias myalias keystore mykeystoreks storepass spass keypass kpass inputjad myjadjad outputjad myjadjad usesha method # using nullauthenticationprovider this method allows to bypass a certificate check and execute unsigned applications as if they were signed and given all requested permissions this method should be used only for development and debugging final testing must be done using a real certificate as described in method # to use nullauthenticationprovider set the following property in the jwcpropertiesini file on the board internal authenticationprovider = comoraclemeepsecuritynullauthenticationprovider note that the java runtime must not be running when

setsecuritymanager setting of the security manager possibly replacing an existing security manager the security manager is a class that allows applications to implement a security policy granting the setsecuritymanager permission would allow code to change which security manager is used by installing a different possibly less restrictive security manager thereby bypassing checks that would have been enforced by the original security manager createsecuritymana ger creation of a new security manager this gives code access to protected sensitive methods that may disclose information about other classes or the execution stack setio setting of systemout and systemerr this allows changing the value of the standard system streams an attacker may set systemerr to a null outputstream which would

extended software management features for oracle java me embedded applications as given in the javaxmicroeditionswm package there are five interfaces and six classes in this package that can be used by applications to enhance software management in addition there are a number of enumerations that are present in the package; these are documented near the classes and methods that use them throughout this chapter suiteinstalllistener interface suiteinstalllistener is a subinterface that provides progress data for an installer that is downloading an app or a link the interface consists of two methods both of which are called at certain times during installation one is the installationdone method which provides only a single code the definitions of which can be found in the installererrorcode interface the other is the updatestatus method which identifies the current task as one of the suiteinstallstage constants that are shown in table and provides an integer percentage of completeness table suiteinstallstate name description done installation has completed downloadingbody install stage downloading application body downloadingdata install stage downloading additional application data downloadingdescriptor install stage downloading application descriptor storing install stage storing application verifying install stage verifying downloaded content here are the two

installererrorcode developer’s guide general purpose inputoutput this chapter describes the general purpose inputoutput gpio functionality in the oracle java me embedded product gpio typically refers a generic pin on an embedded board whose behavior including whether it is an input or output pin can be programmed by the user at runtime gpio pins are often lined up in rows by design they have no dedicated purpose and are used by programmers for a wide variety of tasks for example • gpio pins can be enabled or disabled • gpio pins can be configured to be input or output • input values are readable often with a representing a high voltage and a representing a low voltage • input gpio pins can be used as interrupt lines which allow a peripheral board connected via multiple pins to signal to the primary embedded board that it requires attention • output pin values are both readable and writable warning be sure to observe manufacturer's specifications and warnings carefully for example with the raspberry pi board the voltage value that represents a high value on an input pin may be volts +v however other pins may output volts +v be sure to check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure that you are not placing too much voltage on an input gpio line as the board may not have an overvoltage protection gpio pins have much greater functionality than this but it is important to start with the basics setting a gpio output pin for this example you will need the following hardware table hardware for gpio example hardware where to obtain raspberry pi mb rev b b+ or raspberry pi various thirdparty sellers multimeter various sinometer dtb used in the example general purpose inputoutput perhaps the simplest example of working with the gpio functionality in the oracle java me embedded product is to set the highlow value of an arbitrary output pin and read its voltage with a multimeter in this example we set the value of gpio pin to alternate between high v and low v at intervals of seconds and seconds respectively the following example shows the source code import jdkdiounavailableperipheralexception; import jdkdiodevicemanager; import jdkdiogpiogpiopin; import

will execute without any security exceptions from the oracle java me embedded runtime table permissions for gpio example permission device operation jdkdiodevicemgmtpermission gpio open note that if you're using an ide such as netbeans as the development environment you will need to access the project properties of the project and set api permissions under the application descriptor as shown in figure figure api permissions in the application descriptor in netbeans after running the application set your multimeter to read dc voltage with a maximum of v then connect one of the leads of the multimeter to gpio and the other to gnd ground as the application is running note that the voltage that is read by the multimeter will jump from its low value of around v after a call to pinsetvaluefalse to its high value of around v after a call to pinsetvaluetrue this is shown in figure and figure warning remember that the gpio pin assignments on the raspberry pi do not match the pin numbers on the board for example gpio is not mapped to pin but instead pin see appendix a or the hardwareappropriate getting started guide for the pin assignments for the target boards of the

when prototyping circuits it is often helpful to have a way of connecting wires without having to perform soldering in some cases if there are only a few connections you can use jumper wires however when layout out more complex circuits it's helpful to use a breadboard a typical breadboard is shown in figure working with a breadboard developer’s guide figure a typical breadboard a breadboard consists of a large number of holes each of which are wired together on the bottom using a standardized pattern such as the one shown in figure note that the two columns on both the left and the right of the breadboard are wired verticallythese provide power + and ground connections that can be tapped into to the horizontal rows on either side of the center line on the other hand are used to create circuits circuits can be created using small wires with metal tips on each end that can plug into the holes working with a breadboard general purpose inputoutput figure wiring pattern for a typical breadboard for the raspberry pi we can connect the gpio pins on the pi to a breadboard using a device called a tcobbler extension board this device attaches a ribbon cable to the gpio pins which in turn connects to the tcobbler board the tcobbler board is then inserted into the top of the breadboard as shown in figure working with a breadboard developer’s guide figure tcobbler extension board for the raspberry pi once connected to the pi you can use any of the holes running along the red stripe on the left side of the breadboard to provide + volts v or any of the holes running along the red stripe on the right side of the breadboard to provide + volts v in addition any of the holes running along the blue stripes on either side of the board connect to the ground gnd on the raspberry pi the gpio pins on the raspberry pi map to the pins on the tcobbler and hence the respective horizontal rows on the breadboard as shown in figure working with a breadboard general purpose inputoutput

an led we can use the code in the first example to create a small circuit on the breadboard that turns on an off a lightemitting diode led for this example you will need the following equipment table equipment needed for blinking led example hardware where to obtain led any electronics store ohm resistor any electronics store tcobbler and breadboard adafruit jumper wires male to male adafruit use the breadboard to connect one end of a ohm resistor to a row that connects to gpio which is marked on the tcobbler by ce plug the other end of the ohm blinking an led developer’s guide resistor into an unused row further down the breadboard then run an led from that row an adjacent row and then connect that row to the ground gnd the circuit should look similar to the schematic in figure figure schematic for wiring an led to gpio when completed you should have a prototype that looks like figure run the first example again and you should see the led light blinking off an on whenever the setvaluetrue call is made on the gpiopin object note remember that an led is a diode which by definition only allows current to travel one way through it if your led does not light up when the voltage is applied try flipping the connections so that the current travels the reverse direction through the diode blinking an led general purpose inputoutput figure wiring an led to gpio pin testing output and input pins our next gpio example will take the output voltage from one pin and redirect it back to an adjacent input pin while creating a listener on the input pin that reacts accordingly for this example you will need the following hardware testing output and input pins developer’s guide table hardware for example hardware where to obtain raspberry pi mb rev b various thirdparty sellers multimeter various sinometer dtb used in the example here we use gpio and on the raspberry pi due to their proximity to each other these pins are right next to gpio and gnd which was used in the

from gpio try disconnecting the lead from gpio momentarily and reconnecting it when gpio is high the output of the program should reflect that the listener is called both when the lead is released and when it is reconnected warning remember that the gpio pin assignments on the raspberry pi do not match the pin numbers on the board for example gpio is not mapped to pin but instead pin likewise gpio

setblinkrate writedisplay and clear let's cover each of these in more detail the begin method will initialize the display there are three operations that must be performed to do this properly first the oscillator on the htk led backboard must be turned on we can do this by sending a byte value of hex x across the bus next we set the blink rate of the segment display to one of four values off hz hz or hz finally we can set the brightness of the display using a value of to for the latter two operations we make use of the next two methods which can also be called independently the setblinkrate and setbrightness methods simply take an input value perform bounds checking and calculate the correct byte value to send across the bus just like turning on the oscillator we only need to send one byte across the bus to modify the blink rate or brightness to any level we choose the writedisplay method on the other hand is a little more complex here the class makes use of an array of integers declared as a field that serves as a display experimenting with a segment display developer’s guide buffer in reality the writedisplay method will truncate any value larger then before sending it across the bus but making it an array of integers is helpful for the user each of the entries in the array will map to an address on the htk led backpack that can be written to using the ic bus the purpose of each of the addresses is shown in table note that since the htk can drive different types of led displays several of the addresses are ignored when using this particular character segment

include the following line as well sscacceptandopen; without this line the secure socket will never accept an incoming connection and any attempt to make a connection will result in a runtime exception note that a call to this method will block until a successful connection is made as with the previous examples the java me embedded keystore must have a valid server certificate for the trustlevel that the application is running under which will be validated upon any secure connection if the certificate is absent or is not valid an exception will be thrown on the server the clientside code to make the connection is nearly identical to the clientside example earlier in this chapter with a slight change to the port and the protocol a successful connection should output the following address port connection made! configuring the board as a secure server developer’s guide a java me optimization techniques this appendix covers common optimization techniques when working with java me embedded devices many of these techniques are common to the cldc vm in both java embedded and traditional java me design embedded systems are typically designed to perform a specific task unlike a generalpurpose computer that strives to handle multiple tasks with equal efficiency some embedded systems also have realtime performance constraints for safety and usability; others may have little or no performance requirements allowing the system hardware to be simplified to reduce costs as such developers should use the simplest application design possible to avoid overtaxing the embedded system memory resources are frequently limited in embedded devices often memory is the most valuable resource many embedded devices have memory that is measured in megabytes mb and some of it is used by the runtime operating system rtos leaving the remainder for use by the java vm and its applications be aware of how much memory is typically used by your application the rtos and the java vm this will vary from one embedded board to another by the time a java me embedded application exhausts all memory and is subject to an outofmemoryerror there are few options left the application must either force the vm to free any unnecessary memory using a systemgc call or if that doesn't work crash threads java threads are often an expensive resource with embedded java vms java embedded applications work best when using minimal application threads if you must create multithreaded code be sure to minimize the use of synchronized code which can be expensive on embedded devices as a general rule avoid using the timer class as an extra thread is created for each timer a common technique for creating java me embedded applications is to create a background thread in the startapp method of the midlet class and reuse it throughout the imlet lifecycle system callbacks system callback functions should never block and should return as soon as possible to avoid slowing down the cldc vm pay special attention to the following midlet methods • startapp java me optimization techniques a • pauseapp • midlet constructor inputoutput the record management system rms is an io resource that should be used carefully with any application that uses recordstore objects opening and closing operations should be minimized in addition strive to group reads and writes in one section of code as much as possible spreading recordstore read and writes across the application can slow down the application another common strategy when working with recordstore objects is to use buffers which reside in memory and are often faster this is a common technique • for reading record stores read the entire record into a buffer then parse the buffer • for writing record stores write to a single buffer then write the buffer to a record general tips here are some other general hints for optimizing your code that are pervasive throughout the industry for java me code • object creation is very costly with respect to memory and performance overhead create objects only when needed and reuse any object instances that are created in a cache • use lazy instantiation if appropriate however many java me developers will create all objects outside the main loop of the program and reuse them as the application runs with reusable objects be sure to include a method that returns them to the original state independent of the object constructor • avoid autoboxing when possible • do not perform assertions in tight loops • avoid using variablelength arguments varargs • use local variables instead of global variables when you can local variables are faster and generate less bytecode • only include system classes that you need avoid using wild character imports like import javautil* instead import classes directly such as import javautildate • don't perform string concatenations using the + operator use the stringbuffer class instead for example don't do the following string str = new string hello ;str += world; instead do this stringbuffer str = new stringbuffer hello ;strappendworld; remember that in java string objects are immutable so performing concatenation with the + operator will in fact create a stringbuffer copy the contents of the string over append the other string then copy the result back into a different immutable string object inputoutput a developer’s guide • divide your multidimensional arrays into singledimensional arrays multidimensional arrays take more time to calculate the proper index in memory • avoid any unnecessary creation and disposal of objects and variables inside loops for example avoid a construct like this for int i = ; i < length; i++ myconstantclass c = new myconstantclass; resultsi = cdosomething; • use a switchcase construct instead of if blocks as they are compiled into more optimized bytecode remember that starting with java the switch keyword can handle strings which is more efficient that creating a large number of if blocks that test using the equals method • use public variables directly instead of using getset accessors • set variables to null when you don't need them anymore to assist with garbage collection application size aside from minimizing the number of classes in your application developers can also make use of obfuscator tools which are present in netbeans and other idess the original purpose of an obfuscator is to make reverse engineering bytecode more difficult however it can also create smaller and often faster class files in fact obfuscators typically reduce java me embedded class file size by % to % the netbeans ide contains an option to install the proguard obfuscator library you can choose this option by rightclicking on your project and bringing up the project properties next expand the build leaf and select obfuscating if progaurd is not already installed press the button to download and install the netbeans module as shown in figure a application size java me optimization techniques a figure a installing the proguard obfuscator library once the obfuscator is installed choose an obfuscation level by moving the slider anywhere from level and level as shown in figure a each level presents a detailed description in the window below that shows what operations the obfuscator is performing figure a choosing an obfuscation level application size a developer’s guide b java me embedded properties this appendix documents the configurable options that are found in many ports of the oracle java me embedded product system properties in the oracle java me embedded distribution can be configured in one of two ways by modifying the jwcpropertiesini file if available or by using the vm proxy commandline interface cli modifying the properties file most platforms have a jwcpropertiesini file that can be modified with a text editor the jwcpropertiesini file has two distinct sections • application properties that are used by java applications that are running on the board • internal properties used for internal system configuration in addition each jwcpropertiesini file contains comments that help describe the purpose of each entry it is highly recommend that you read through the original jwcpropertiesini file for your target embedded board as it contains essential information about each property note that the oracle java me embedded runtime may alter the values inside of the jwcpropertiesini file at any time especially if the setproperty and saveproperties commands are issued in the cli and typically without comments so it helps to study the original version that comes with each distribution bundle using the commandline interface in addition to specifying properties in the jwcpropertiesini file system properties can also be modified on the fly using the cli setproperty command the setproperty command uses the following syntax setproperty <key> <value> if you wish to examine the current value of any property use the getproperty command getproperty <key> note that after any property change the vm state is unpredictable and it is necessary to issue the saveproperties command and 'shutdown r' or depending on the embedded board cycle the power to activate the changes see chapter for more information on using the vm proxy cli java me embedded properties b the list of configurable system properties differs extensively on each platform and with each release and may be retrieved by issuing the following command via the cli proxy > propertieslist for example the properties list that is generated for the raspberry pi would look similar to the following read only string xmlrpcsubsetversion = readwrite string xmljaxpsubsetversion = readwrite bool vmconfigsystemreboot = false read only string systemstorageroot = appdb readwrite bool systemnetworkreconnect = false readwrite int systemjamspace = read only string systemdefaultstorage = appdb read only string socket = comsunmidpiojmesocketprotocolpushimpl readwrite string securityprovidersjar = null several lines omitted readwrite int amsmemorylimitmvm = using the commandline interface b developer’s guide c signing an imlet suite's jar file establishing trust is important for imlet suites that use securitysensitive apis signing an imlet suite's jar file allows the suite to be trusted a jar file is signed with the jadtool utility a copy of the jadtool utility is provided with the oracle java me embedded software bundle the jadtool utility signs a jar file by adding a certificate and the jar file's digital signature to a java application descriptor jad file adding a certificate and a jar file's digital signature to a jad file are separate steps you must complete both steps to sign a jar file the steps are in “instructions for using jadtool” you can also use the jadtool utility to obtain information about a certificate in a jad file the information can include the name of the entity that issued the certificate the certificate's serial number the dates between which it is valid and its message digest algorithm md and secure hash algorithm sha fingerprints instructions for using jadtool this section explains how to use the jadtool utility through an example that signs a hypothetical imlet suite named imaginaryimlet note imaginaryimlet is not an actual imlet suite no imaginaryimlet files are included with this release the example uses the key pair provided with the software the key pair is in the jsetestkeystorebin file which is a keystore managed with the java se platform's keytool utility for information on the keytool utility see http downloadoraclecomjavasedocstechnotestoolswindows keytoolhtml after you build an implementation of the software jsetestkeystorebin is located in this directory outputdirmeepbini where outputdir is the directory that contains the output of your builds of the oracle java me embedded software the password for the file is keystorepwd the alias of the key pair is dummyca the private key password is keypwd the file is provided for testing purposes for imlet suites on enduser devices use an rsa key pair backed by a certificate or certificate chain from a certificate authority you must import the certificate or certificate chain into a java se platform's keystore with the java se platform's keytool utility signing an imlet suite's jar file c the jadtool utility is packaged in a jar file named jadtooljar in this directory where ojmeedir is the base directory of the oracle java me embedded installation ojmeedir\toolkitlib\process\jadtool\code using the jadtool utility open a windows command prompt change your current directory to the directory that holds your imlet's jar and jad files add the certificate for your key pair to the jad file using the jadtool utility the jadtool utility adds the certificate as the value of an attribute named midletcertificatemn where m is the number of the certificate chain it defaults to one but you can provide a different number with the chainnum switch and n is an integer that for new certificates begins at one and increments by one each time you add a new certificate to the jad file for example if outputdirbinaries is c\jme\src\output\binaries the following command adds the certificate as the value of the attribute midletcertificate to the example jad file c\myimlets>java jar %ojmeehome%\toolkitlib\process \jadtool\code\jadtooljar addcert alias dummyca storepass keystorepwd keystore c\jme\src\output\midp\bin \i\jsetestkeystorebin inputjad imaginaryimletjad outputjad imaginaryimletjad optional verify that the certificate is added to the jad

fingerprints md fecddbbfb sha dccecdefebfbdfedac if you have a key pair backed by a certificate chain import the intermediate certificates import the intermediate certificates using the jadtool utility with the addcert switch shown in step taking care to use the correct chain order for example the xxxx company provides a certificate that vouches for your key pair the widgetcertificates company vouches for the xxxx certificate and verisign vouches for the widgetcertificates certificate import the xxxx certificate followed by the widgetcertificate the xxxx certificate is midletcertificate and the widgetcertificate certificate is midletcertificate using the jadtool utility c developer’s guide note you do not import the certificate of the root ca in this example the certificate is from verisign the root certificate is on the device sign the jar file using the jadtool utility the jadtool utility signs the jar file base encodes the signature and stores it as the value of the midletjarrsasha attribute of the output jad file note the key used to sign the jar file must be from the same java se keystore entry as key pair specified in step the jadtool utility does not check that the jar file is signed with a keystore entry that has a certificate in the jad file for example c\myimlets>java jar %ojmeehome%\toolkitlib\process \jadtool\code\jadtooljar addjarsig keystore c\jme\src \output\midp\bin\i\jsetestkeystorebin alias dummyca storepass keystorepwd keypass keypwd jarfile imaginaryimletjar chainnum inputjad imaginaryimletjad outputjad imaginaryimletjad

can have multiple certificate but it can hold the signature for only one jar file when a certificate in the jad file expires you must add a new certificate and resign the jar file when resigning the

returns the same information as the help option • addcert alias keyalias keystore keystore  storepass password  chainnum chainnumber  certnum certnumber  encoding encoding inputjad inputjadfile outputjad outputjadfile adds a certificate to a jad file to add a certificate this utility first creates the certificate from the entry identified by keyalias in keystore the keystore if provided must

if keystore is not provided its default userhomedirkeystore is used if keystore requires a password to access its contents password must be provided after creating the certificate and attribute name this utility concatenates the contents of inputjadfile with the new certificate and writes it as outputjadfile you can use the same file for the inputjadfile and outputjadfile the certificate is in the jad file as the value of an attribute named midletcertificatemn where • m is chainnumber or if it is not provided a jad file can contain multiple certificate chain • n is certnumber the value certnumber depends on whether the new certificate replaces an existing certificate if the certificate is a replacement then certnumber must be the number of the certificate to replace for example if the new certificate would replace the one stored as the value of attribute midletcertificate then certnumber must be if the certificate is new certnumber is ignored if inputjadfile uses an encoding

creates the signature with it using the emsapkcsv encoding method of pkcs # version see rfc at http wwwietforgrfcrfctxt after creating the signature this utility concatenates the contents of inputjadfile with the signature and writes it as outputjadfile the signature is base encoded and is in the output jad file as the value of the midletjarrsasham attribute where m is chainnumber or if it is not provided this number corresponds to the value for m in the midletcertificatemn attribute if inputjadfile uses an encoding other than utf ascii with unicode escapes encoding must be specified

the n for example to show the certificate that is the value of attribute midletcertificate the chainnumber must be and certnumber must be if certnumber or chainnumber are not provided and the all option is not used the utility uses a the information printed includes the certificate's subject issuer serial number dates between which it is valid and fingerprints md and sha the attributes in the subject and issuer names are shown in reverse order from what is in the certificate a side effect of using the java se platform certificate api as a result the names might not match what is returned from other tools that display a certificate's subject and issuer names if inputjadfile uses an encoding other than utf ascii with unicode escapes encoding must be specified the tool uses the same encoding for reading inputjadfile and writing outputjadfile options summary signing an imlet suite's jar file c options summary c developer’s guide d managing keys and certificates the oracle java me embedded platform uses public keys from a certificate authority ca to validate web sites and signed imlet suites the oracle java me embedded implementation also uses private keys from certificates to establish secure connections with client authentication when the platform uses a secure protocol to access a web site the site provides a certificate which is typically signed by a ca in the same manner signed imlet suites also contain a certificate that is signed by a ca the oracle java me embedded platform checks the validity of a certificate by using the ca's public key by signing a certificate a ca certifies the identify of the owner of the web site or imlet suite you can manage the ca certificates public keys and private keys on the embedded board by using the mekeytool utility the mekeytool utility is provided with the java me sdk distribution and is similar to the keytool utility provided with the java se platform except that mekeytool will also operate across a network on the keystores of an embedded device that is currently recognized by the oracle java me embedded device manager this chapter describes how to use mekeytool to manage keystores that are used by the oracle java me embedded emulator or recognized by the oracle java me sdk device manager running mekeytool mekeytool is an executable that can be found in the following location mesdkhomedir\bin\mekeytoolexe where mesdkhomedir is the base directory of the oracle java me embedded installation to connect to a keystore on an embedded board instead of the emulator add the xdevice option to reference a device currently recognized by the oracle java me embedded device manager mekeytoolexe xdeviceembeddedexternaldevice warning each embedded board may only accept a limited subset of commands depending on the functionality offered to list the functionality supported by the device embeddedexternaldevice for example you can use the emulator's xquery option emulatorexe xquery xdeviceembeddedexternaldevice managing keys and certificates d using the mekeytool utility open a command prompt or terminal window change your current directory to the location of the exe file shown above or add the directory to your current %path% run mekeytool with the options needed for example use the following command to display help mekeytoolexe help me keystores the mekeytool utility keeps the ca certificates public keys and private keys in an me keystore depending on the device the keystore is at the following locations where basedir is the base directory of the oracle java me embedded or oracle java me sdk installation table d location of keystores device location emulator basedirruntimesmeepappdbcerts embedded boards basedirappdbcerts if file system is accessible this keystore directory contains an index file named mainks and a set of certificate files the platform includes the key of one ca warning oracle does not recommend modifying the default keystore but instead modifying a copy either one that is usergenerated or in the working directory for the appropriate device working directory for the emulator when the oracle java me embedded emulator is first started it creates a working directory in userhomedirjavamesdkversionworkdeviceappdbcerts note that this is only the case for emulated devices such as embeddeddevice not devices that map to actual embedded boards such as embeddedexternaldevice next it copies all certificates and several other important files there be aware that deleting the working directory removes all device settings and of course any additions to the local keystore note the mekeytool utility enables you to import keys from java se keystores however you cannot use the mekeytool utility directly on a java se keystore for example if you try to use the mekeytool utility to view public keys in a java se keystore the utility displays an error message that the keystore is corrupted an me keystore has a different format java se platform using the mekeytool utility d developer’s guide keystores which have a format in accordance with the java cryptography architecture specification creating and managing multiple me keystores in addition to managing the public keys in the me keystore you can use the mekeytool utility to manage additional me keystores both with the emulator and some embedded boards that contain an accessible filesystem for example during testing you might want to have multiple keystores to run against one keystore could contain all the necessary testing keys a second keystore could contain a subset of the testing keys and a third keystore could contain an expired key creating alternate me keystores the mekeytool utility does not create a new me keystore directory the developer must create an empty keystore first consisting of a directory and an empty mainks file which can be copied from the keystore provided with the distribution bundle see importing a key for instructions on how to import a key managing alternate me keystores to manage a keystore other than the default use the import mekeystore option mekeytoolexe import mekeystore keystorename for example if you created an me keystore userhomedir\mykeys \settestkeysks that contains the keys that are needed to run a particular set of tests use the mekeytool command to manage that keystore mekeytoolexe import mekeystore userhomedirmykeys settestkeysks for all mekeytool commands you receive an error message if the file that you provide as an argument to mekeystore does not exist importing a key you can add a key to an me keystore by importing it from the java cryptography architecture keystore that comes with the java se platform or from a keystore that you create for more information on the keystore that comes with the java se platform see httpdownloadoraclecomjavasedocstechnotes toolswindowskeytoolhtml the file name for the java se keystore is keystore and the default location is in your home directory this file is created if you use the java se platform's keytool utility to create keys and you do not specify a different location the mekeytool utility references this keystore unless you use the keystore argument to specify a different keystore note if you use a java se keystore other than the default the new keystore might require a password the import option imports a key for example to add a key with an alias dummyca from the java se keystore jsetestkeystorebin that has a password importing a key managing keys and certificates d keystorepwd to the me keystore at userhomedirmykeys

unused keys for example if you added the public key of a test site with a selfsigned certificate during testing you can delete that key when testing is completed the delete command to the mekeytool utility removes a key from an me keystore the delete command requires one of the following options • owner ownername sets the string that describes the owner of the public key in a given keystore use the list command to print information about each key in the keystore the string in the command must match the one printed when you use the list command to the mekeytool utility see listing available

assess a sick or injured person treatment for injuries and conditions is given in the chapters that follow which are grouped by body system or the type of injury the final chapter provides a quickreference guide to emergency first aid the chapters are grouped by body system or cause of injury within the sections there are easytounderstand anatomy features that explain the risks involved with particular injuries or conditions and how and why first aid can help anatomy introduction colorcoded chapters help you find relevant sections easily introduction gives an overview of the anatomy for the section clear computergenerated artworks of body systems illustrate each section additional artworks provide extra information  the heart and blood vessels key key the heart and the blood vessels make up the circulatory system these structures supply the body with a constant flow of blood which brings oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and carries waste products away blood is pumped around the body by rhythmic contractions beats of the heart muscle the blood runs through a network of vessels divided into three types arteries veins and capillaries the force that is exerted by the blood flow through the main arteries is called blood pressure the pressure varies with the strength and phase of the heartbeat the elasticity of the arterial walls and the volume and thickness of the blood the heart pumps blood by muscular contractions called heartbeats which are controlled by electrical impulses generated in the heart each beat has three phases diastole when the blood enters the heart; atrial systole when it is squeezed out of the atria collecting chambers; and ventricular systole when blood leaves the heart in diastole the heart relaxes oxygenated blood from the lungs flows through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium blood that has given up its oxygen to body tissues deoxygenated blood flows from the venae cavae large veins that enter the heart into the right atrium in atrial systole the two atria contract and the valves between the atria and the ventricles pumping chambers open so that blood flows into the ventricles during ventricular systole the ventricles contract the thickwalled left ventricle forces blood into the aorta main artery which carries it to the rest of the body the right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary arteries which carry it to the lungs to collect more oxygen how the heart functions wounds and circulation the heart and blood vessels how blood circulates oxygenated blood passes from the lungs to the heart then travels to body tissues via the arteries blood that has given up its oxygen deoxygenated blood returns to the heart through the veins capillary networks a network of fine blood vessels capillaries links arteries and veins within body tissues oxygen and nutrients pass from the blood into the tissues; waste products pass from the tissues into the blood through capillaries the heart this muscular organ pumps blood around the body and then to the lungs to pick up oxygen coronary blood vessels supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients carotid artery brachial vein jugular vein aorta heart muscle superior vena cava coronary artery inferior vena cava capillary small artery arteriole small vein venule radial vein femoral vein pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to lungs pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from lungs to heart heart pumps blood around body vena cava carries deoxygenated blood from body tissues to heart brachial artery radial artery femoral artery aorta carries oxygenated blood to body tissues pulmonary artery blood flow through the heart the heart’s right side pumps deoxygenated blood from the body to the lungs the left side pumps oxygenated blood to the body via the aorta the blood cells red blood cells contain hemoglobin a red pigment that enables the cells to carry oxygen white blood cells play a role in defending the body against infection platelets help blood clot right atrium right ventricle valve left ventricle white blood cell platelet left atrium ascending aorta carries blood to upper body superior vena cava carries blood from upper body inferior vena cava carries blood from lower body descending aorta carries blood to lower body pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to lungs red blood cell there are about pints liters or pint per pounds of body weight liter per kg of blood in the average adult body roughly percent of the blood is clear yellow fluid plasma in this fluid are suspended the red and white blood cells and the platelets all of which make up the remaining percent composition of blood vessels carrying oxygenated blood vessels carrying oxygenated blood vessels carrying deoxygenated blood vessels carrying deoxygenated blood  effects of heat and cold minor burns and scalds burns to the airway minor burns and scalds burns to the airway see also hypoxia p shock pp the unconscious casualty pp  reddened skin  pain in the area of the burn later there may be  blistering of the affected skin there may be  soot around the nose or mouth  singeing of the nasal hairs  redness swelling or actual burning of the tongue  damage to the skin around the mouth  hoarseness of the voice  breathing difficulties  to stop the burning  to relieve pain and swelling  to minimize the risk of infection  to maintain an open airway  to arrange urgent removal to the hospital recognition recognition your aims your aims small superficial burns and scalds are often due to domestic incidents such as touching a hot iron or oven rack most minor burns can be treated successfully by first aid and will heal naturally however you should advise the casualty to seek medical advice if you are at all concerned about the severity of the injury assessing a burn pp after a burn blisters may form these thin “bubbles” are caused by tissue fluid leaking into the burned area just beneath the skin’s surface you should never break a blister caused by a burn because you may introduce infection into the wound what to do what to do call for emergency help tell the dispatcher that you suspect flood the injured part burns to the casualty’s airway with cold water for at least ten minutes or until the pain is relieved if water is not available any cold harmless liquid such as milk can be used reassure the casualty monitor and record vital signs—level of response breathing and pulse pp—while waiting for help to arrive take or send the casualty to the hospital if the casualty is a child or if you are in any doubt about the casualty’s condition take any steps possible to improve the casualty’s air supply such as loosening clothing around his neck gently remove any jewelry watches belts or constricting clothing from the injured area before it begins to swell offer the casualty ice or small sips of cold water to reduce swelling and pain when the burn is cooled cover it with plastic wrap or place a clean plastic bag over a foot or hand apply the wrap lengthwise over the burn not around the limb because the tissues swell if you do not have plastic wrap or a plastic bag use a sterile dressing or a gauze pad bandaged loosely in place   any burn to the face mouth or throat is very serious because the air passages may become swollen usually signs of burning such as soot or singed nasal hairs is evident suspect damage to the airway if a casualty sustains burns in a confined space—he is likely to have inhaled hot air or gases there is no specific first aid treatment for an extreme case of burns to the airway; the swelling will rapidly block the airway and there is a serious risk of hypoxia immediate and specialized medical help is required  if the casualty loses consciousness open the airway and check breathing the unconscious casualty pp  do not break blisters or otherwise interfere with the injured area  do not apply adhesive dressings or adhesive tape to the skin because removing them may tear damaged skin  do not apply any ointments other than antibiotic ones such as bacitracin—they may damage tissues  the use of specialized dressings sprays and gels to cool burns is not recommended  do not put blister bandages on blisters caused by a burn never burst a blister; they usually need no treatment however if a blister breaks or is likely to burst cover it with a nonadhesive sterile dressing that extends well beyond the edges of the blister leave the dressing in place until the blister subsides special case blisters see also assessing a burn pp caution caution introduction how to use this book the main part of the book features eight colorcoded chapters outlining first aid for more than conditions or injuries for each entry there is an introduction that describe the risks and likely cause then first aid treatment is shown in clear stepbystep instructions at the back of the manual is a quickreference emergency section that provides additional ataglance action plans for potentially lifethreatening injuries and conditions from unconsciousness and bleeding to asthma and heart attack conditions and injuries emergency advice stepbystep instructions explain each stage of treatment special case boxes highlight instances where alternative action may be required lists of recognition features help you identify a condition caution boxes alert you to potential risks or alternative treatments your aims boxes summarize purpose of first aid caution boxes advise on possible complications every step described illustrated for instant advice recognition lists repeated to provide quick identification of a condition cross references guide you back to the main article in the book  emergency first aid broken bones burns and scalds broken bones burns and scalds help the casualty support the affected part at the joints above and below the injury in the most comfortable position make the casualty comfortable by helping him sit or lie down flood the injury with cold water; cool for at least ten minutes or until pain is relieved place padding such as towels or cushions around the affected part to support it call for emergency help if necessary tell the dispatcher that the injury is a burn and explain what caused it and the estimated size and depth for extra support or if help is delayed secure the injured part to an uninjured part of the body for upper body injuries use a sling; for lower limb injuries use broadand narrowfold bandages tie knots on the uninjured side while you are cooling the burn carefully remove any clothing or jewelry from the area before it starts to swell; a helper can do this for you do not remove anything that is sticking to the burn a casualty with an arm injury could be taken by car if not in shock but a leg injury should go by ambulance so call for emergency help treat for shock monitor and record the casualty’s level of response breathing and pulse until help arrives cover the burn with plastic wrap placed lengthwise over the injury or use a plastic bag alternatively use a sterile dressing or clean gauze pad monitor and record the casualty’s level of response breathing and pulse while waiting for help support injured part start to cool burn protect injury with padding call for emergency help support with slings or bandages remove any constrictions take or send casualty to the hospital cover burn find out more pp find out more pp    do not attempt to move an injured limb unnecessarily or if it causes further pain  if there is an open wound cover it with a sterile dressing or a clean gauze pad and bandage it in place  do not give the casualty anything to eat or drink because an anesthetic may be needed  do not raise an injured leg when treating a casualty for shock  do not apply specialized dressings lotions or fat to a burn but bacitracin can be used on first degree burns  do not use adhesive dressings  do not touch the burn or burst any blisters  if the burn is severe treat the casualty for shock p  if the burn is on the face do not cover it keep cooling with water until help arrives  if the burn is caused by contact with chemicals wear protective gloves and irrigate for at least minutes  watch the casualty for signs of smoke inhalation such as difficulty breathing  distortion swelling and bruising at the injury site  pain and difficulty in moving the injured part there may be  bending twisting or shortening of a limb  a wound possibly with bone ends protruding there may be  possible areas of superficial partialthickness andor fullthickness burns  pain in the area of

effects of each condition see also references direct you to related conditions first aid is the initial assistance or treatment given to a person who is injured or suddenly becomes ill the person who provides this help may be a first aider a first responder a policeman or fireman or a paramedic or emt this chapter prepares you for being a first aider psychologically and emotionally as well as giving practical advice on what you should and should not do in an emergency situation the information given throughout this book will help you give effective first aid to any casualty in any situation however to become a fully competent first aider you should complete a recognized first aid course and receive certification this will also strengthen your skills and increase your confidence the american red cross and the american heart association teach a variety of first aid courses at different educational levels  to understand your own abilities and limitations  to stay safe and calm at all times  to assess a situation quickly and calmly and summon the appropriate help if necessary  to assist the casualty and provide the necessary treatment with the help of others if possible  to pass on relevant information to the emergency services or to the person who takes responsibility for the casualty  to be aware of your own needs aims and objectives becoming a first aider becoming a first aider what is a first aider? first aid refers to the actions taken in response to someone who is injured or has suddenly become ill a first aider is a person who takes action while taking care to keep everyone involved safe p and to cause no further harm while doing so follow the actions that most benefit the casualty taking into account your own skills knowledge and experience using the guidelines set out in this book this chapter prepares you for the role of first aider by providing guidance on responding to a first aid situation and assessing the priorities for the casualty there is advice on the psychological aspect of giving first aid and practical guidance on how to protect yourself and the casualty chapter managing an incident pp provides guidelines on dealing with events traffic accidents or fires for example chapter assessing a casualty pp looks at the practical steps to take when assessing a sick or injured person’s condition one of the primary rules of first aid is to ensure that an area is safe for you before you approach a casualty p do not attempt heroic rescues in hazardous circumstances if you put yourself at risk you are unlikely to be able to help casualties and could become one yourself and cause harm to others if it is not safe do not approach the casualty but call for emergency help  assess a situation quickly and calmly  protect yourself and any casualties from danger—never put yourself at risk p  prevent crosscontamination between yourself and the casualty as best as possible p  comfort and reassure casualties  assess the casualty identify as best as you can the injury or nature of illness affecting a casualty pp  give early treatment and treat the casualties with the most serious lifethreatening conditions first  arrange for appropriate help call for emergency help if you suspect serious injury or illness; take or send the casualty to the hospital; transfer him into the care of a healthcare professional or to a higher level of medical care stay with a casualty until care is available first aid priorities assessing an incident when you come across an incident stay calm and support the casualty ask him what has happened try not to move the casualty; if possible treat him in the position you find him what is a first aider? how to prepare yourself how to prepare yourself when responding to an emergency you should recognize the emotional and physical needs of all involved including your own you should look after your own psychological health and be able to recognize stress if it develops pp a calm considerate response from you that engenders trust and respect from those around you is fundamental to your being able to give or receive information from a casualty or witnesses effectively this includes being aware of and managing your reactions so that you can focus on the casualty and make an assessment by talking to a casualty in a kind considerate gentle but firm manner you will inspire confidence in your actions and this will generate trust between you and the casualty without this confidence he may not tell you about an important event injury or symptom and may remain in a highly distressed state the actions described in this chapter aim to help you facilitate this trust minimize distress and provide support to promote the casualty’s ability to cope and recover the key steps to being an effective first aider are  be calm in your approach  be aware of risks to yourself and others  build and maintain trust from the casualty and the bystanders  give early treatment treating the most serious lifethreatening conditions first  call appropriate help  remember your own needs it is important to be calm in your approach to providing first aid consider what situations might challenge you and how you would deal with them in order to convey confidence to others and encourage them to trust you you need to control your own emotions and reactions people often fear the unknown becoming more familiar with first aid priorities and the key techniques in this book can help you feel more comfortable by identifying your fears in advance you can take steps to overcome them learn as much as you can for example by enrolling in a first aid course asking others how they dealt with similar situations or talking your fears through with a person you trust stay in control in an emergency situation the body responds by releasing hormones that may cause a “fight flight or freeze” response when this happens your heart beats faster your breathing quickens and you may sweat more you may also feel more alert want to run away or feel frozen to the spot if you feel overwhelmed and slightly panicky you may feel pressured to do something before you are clear about what is needed pause and take a few slow breaths consider who else might help you feel calmer and remind yourself of the first aid priorities opposite if you still feel overwhelmed take another breath and tell yourself to be calmer when you are calm you will be better able to think more clearly and plan your response the thoughts you have are linked to the way you behave and the way you feel if you think that you cannot cope you will have more trouble determining what to do and will feel more anxious more ready to fight flee or freeze if you know how to calm yourself you will be better able to deal with anxiety and help the casualty be calm when you give first aid it is important to protect yourself and the casualty from infection as well as injury take steps to avoid crosscontamination—transmitting germs or infection to a casualty or contracting infection from a casualty remember infection is a risk even with relatively minor injuries it is a particular concern if you are treating a wound because bloodborne viruses such as hepatitis b or c and human immunodeficiency virus hiv may be transmitted by contact with blood in practice the risk is low and should not deter you from carrying out first aid the risk increases if an infected person’s blood makes contact with yours through a cut or scrape usually taking measures such as washing your hands and wearing disposable gloves will provide sufficient protection for you and the casualty there is no known evidence of these bloodborne viruses being transmitted during resuscitation if a face shield or pocket mask is available it should be used when you give rescue breaths pp and pp take care not to prick yourself with any needle found on or near a casualty or cut yourself on glass if you accidentally prick or cut your skin or splash your eye wash the area thoroughly and seek medical help immediately if you are providing first aid on a regular basis it is advisable to seek guidance on additional personal protection such as immunization if you think you have been exposed to an infection while giving first aid seek medical advice as soon as possible  do wash your hands and wear latexfree disposable gloves in case you or the casualty are allergic to latex if gloves are not available ask the casualty to dress his or her own wound or enclose your hands in clean plastic bags  do cover cuts and scrapes on your hands with waterproof dressings  do wear a plastic apron if dealing with large quantities of body fluids and wear glasses or goggles to protect your eyes  do dispose of all waste safely p  do not touch a wound or any part of a dressing that will come into contact with a wound with your bare hands  do not breathe cough or sneeze over a wound while you are treating a casualty becoming a first aider protection from infection when to seek medical advice minimizing the risk of crosscontamination to help protect yourself from infection you can carry protective equipment such as caution  pocket mask or face shield  latexfree disposable gloves  alcohol gel to clean your hands protection from infection how to wash your hands wet your hands under running water put some soap into the palm of a cupped hand rub the palms of your hands together rub the back of the fingers of your right hand against the palm of your left hand then repeat with your left hand in your right palm rub the palm of your left hand against the back of your right hand then rub the right palm on the back of your left hand rub your right thumb in the palm of your left hand then your left thumb in the right palm interlock the fingers of both hands and work the soap between them rub the fingertips of your left hand in the palm of your right hand and vice versa rinse thoroughly then pat dry with a disposable paper towel  if you can wash your hands before you touch a casualty but if this is not possible wash them as soon as possible afterward for a thorough wash pay attention to all parts of the hands— palms wrists fingers and thumbs and fingernails use soap and water if available or rub your hands with alcohol gel thorough handwashing » becoming a first aider in addition to hand washing gloves give added protection against infection in a first aid situation if possible carry protective disposable latexfree gloves with you at all times wear them whenever there is a likelihood of contact with blood or other body fluids if in doubt wear them anyway disposable gloves should be used to treat only one casualty put them on just before you approach a casualty and remove them as soon as the treatment is completed and before you do anything else when taking off the gloves hold the top edge of one glove with your other gloved hand and peel it off so that it is inside out repeat with the other hand without touching the outside of the gloves dispose of them in a biohazard bag below ideally wash your hands before putting on the gloves hold one glove by the top and pull it on do not touch the main part of the glove with your fingers pick up the second glove with the gloved hand with your fingers under the top edge pull it onto your hand your gloved fingers should not touch your skin always use latexfree gloves some people have a serious allergy to latex and this may cause anaphylactic shock p nitrile gloves often blue or purple are recommended using protective gloves dealing with waste once you have treated a casualty all soiled material must be disposed of carefully to prevent the spread of infection place items such as dressings or gloves in a plastic bag—ideally a biohazard bag—and give it to the emergency services seal the bag tightly and label it to show that it contains clinical waste put sharp objects including needles in a plastic container known as a sharps container which is usually red if no sharps container is available put used needles in a jar with a screw top and give it to the emt for disposal biohazard bag sharps container  putting on gloves «protection from infection caution protection from infection dealing with a casualty dealing with a casualty casualties are often frightened because of what is happening to them and what may happen next your role is to stay calm and take charge of the situation—but be ready to stand back if there is someone better qualified if there is more than one casualty use the primary survey pp to identify the most seriously injured casualties and treat in the order of priority consider the age and appearance of your casualty when you talk to him since different people need different responses respect people’s wishes; accept that someone might want to be treated in a particular way communication can be difficult if a person speaks a different language or cannot hear you use simple language or signs or write questions down ask if anyone speaks the same language as the casualty or knows the person or saw the incident and can describe what happened building trust diversity and communication establish trust with your casualty by introducing yourself find out what the person likes to be called and use his name when you talk to him crouch or kneel down so that you are at the same height as the casualty explain what is happening and why you will inspire trust if you say what you are doing before you do it treat the casualty with dignity and respect at all times if possible give him choices for example whether he would prefer to sit or lie down andor who he would like to have with him also if possible gain his consent before you treat him by asking if he agrees with whatever you are going to do reassure the casualty when treating a casualty remain calm and do not do anything without explanation try to answer any questions he may have honestly » special case treating children you will need to use simpler shorter words when talking to children if possible make sure a child’s parents or caregivers are with him and keep them involved at all times it is important to establish the caregiver’s trust as well as the child’s talk first to the parentcaregiver and get his or her permission to continue to treat the child once the parent caregiver trusts you the child will also feel more confident becoming a first aider dealing with a casualty use your eyes and ears to be aware of how a casualty responds listen by showing verbal and nonverbal listening skills  make eye contact but look away now and then so as not to stare  use a calm confident voice that is loud enough to be heard but do not shout  do not speak too quickly  keep instructions simple use short sentences and simple words  use affirming nods and “mmms” to show you are listening when the casualty speaks  check that the casualty understands what you mean—ask to make sure  use simple hand gestures and movements  do not interrupt the casualty but always acknowledge what you are told; for example summarize what a casualty has told you to show that you understand when a casualty resists help treating the casualty listen carefully if someone is ill or injured he may be upset confused tearful angry andor anxious to get away be sensitive to a casualty’s feelings; let him know that his reactions are understandable also accept that you may not be able to help or might even be seen as a threat stay at a safe distance until you have gained the person’s consent to move closer so that he does not feel crowded do not argue or disagree a casualty may refuse help for example because he is suffering from a head injury or hypothermia if you think a person needs something other than what he asks for explain why for example you could say “i think someone should look at where you’re hurt before you move in case moving makes it worse” if someone still refuses your help and you think he needs urgent medical attention call for emergency help a casualty has the right to refuse help even if it causes further harm tell the dispatcher that you have offered first aid and have been refused if you are worried that a person’s condition is deteriorating observe from a distance until help arrives when treating a casualty always relate to him calmly and thoughtfully to maintain trust think about how he might be feeling check that you have understood what the casualty said and consider the impact of your actions for example is the casualty becoming more or less upset angry and tense? a change in emotional state can indicate that a condition is worsening be prepared to change your manner depending on what a person feels comfortable with; for example ask fewer questions or talk about something else keep a casualty updated and give him options rather than telling him what to do ask the casualty about his nextofkin or friends who can help and help him make contact with them ask if you can help make arrangements so that any responsibilities the casualty may have can be taken care of stay with the casualty do not leave someone who may be dying seriously ill or badly injured alone except to go to call for emergency help talk to the casualty while touching his shoulder or arm or holding a hand never allow a casualty to feel alone « dealing with a casualty in an emergency situation you may be faced with several tasks at once to maintain safety to call for help and to start giving first aid some of the people at the scene may be able to help you do the following  make the area safe; for example control traffic and keep onlookers away  call for emergency help p  obtain first aid equipment for example an aed automated external defibrillator  control bleeding with direct pressure or support an injured limb  help maintain the casualty’s privacy by holding a blanket around the scene and encouraging onlookers to move away  transport the casualty to a safe place if his life is in immediate danger only if it is safer to move him than to leave him where he is and you have the necessary help and equipment p the reactions of bystanders may cause you concern or anger they may have had no first aid training and feel helpless or frightened themselves if they have seen or been involved in the incident they too may be injured and distressed bear this in mind if you need to ask a bystander to help you talk to people in a firm but gentle manner by staying calm yourself you will gain their trust and help them remain calm too enlisting help from others care of personal belongings keeping notes make sure the casualty’s belongings are with him at all times if you have to search belongings for identification or clues to a person’s condition medication for example do so in front of a reliable witness if possible ask the casualty’s permission before you do this afterward ensure that all of the clothing and personal belongings and medication accompany the casualty to the hospital or are handed over to the police as you gather information about a casualty write it down so that you can refer to it later a written record of the timing of events is particularly valuable to medical personnel note for example the length of a period of unconsciousness the duration of a seizure the time of any changes in the casualty’s condition and the time of any intervention or treatment hand your notes to the emergency services when they arrive or give them to the casualty useful information to provide includes  casualty’s details including his name age and contact details  history of the incident or illness  brief description of any injuries  unusual behavior or a change in behavior  treatment—where given and when  vital signs—level of response breathing rate and pulse pp if the first aider is trained  medical history  medication the casualty has taken with details of the amounts taken and when  nextofkin contact details  your contact details as well as the date time and place of your involvement remember that any information you gather is confidential never share it with anyone not involved in the casualty’s care without his agreement let the casualty know why you are recording information and who you will give it to when you are asking for such information be sensitive to who is around and of the casualty’s privacy and dignity becoming a first aider requesting help further help is available from a range of sources if help is needed you must decide both on the type of help and how to access it first carry out a primary survey pp to ascertain the severity of the casualty’s condition if it is not serious explain the options and allow him to choose where to go if a casualty’s condition is serious seek emergency help throughout the book there are guidelines for choosing the appropriate level of help  call for emergency help if the casualty needs urgent medical attention and should be transported to the hospital in an ambulance for example when you suspect a heart attack  take or send the casualty to a hospital choose this option when a casualty needs hospital treatment but his condition is unlikely to worsen; for example with a finger injury you can take him yourself if you can arrange transportation—either in your own car or in a taxi  seek medical advice depending on what is available in his area the casualty should be advised to call his own physician or nurse practitioner he would do this for example when he has symptoms such as earache or diarrhea you can call for help from  emergency services including police fire and ambulance services by calling   utilities including gas electricity or water—the phone number will be in the telephone directory  health services including doctor dentist and hospital—this varies in different areas the phone numbers will be in the telephone directory calls to the emergency services are free from any phone including cell phones on some roadways emergency phones have been placed at regular intervals to enable people to call for help to summon help using these telephones pick up the receiver and your call will be answered however the density of these phones can vary widely by state and area you may do better with a cell phone than these highway phones keep time away from the casualty to a minimum ideally tell someone else to make the call for you while you stay with the casualty ask the person to confirm that the call has been made and that help is on the way if you have to leave a casualty to call for help first take any necessary vital action primary survey pp calling for help calling for help when calling for help in an emergency stay calm be clear and concise and give as much detail as possible requesting help when you dial you will be asked which service you require if there are casualties ask for the ambulance service ems; the dispatcher will alert other services if they are required always remain on the telephone and let the dispatcher hang up first because you may be given important information about what to do for the casualty while you wait andor asked for further information as the situation develops if someone else makes the call make sure that he is aware of the importance of his call and that he reports back to you after making the call talking to the emergency services state your name clearly and say that you are acting in your capacity as a first aider it is essential to provide the following  your telephone number andor the number you are calling from  the exact location of the incident; give a road name or number it can also be helpful to mention any intersections or other landmarks in the area in many cases your call can be traced if you are unsure of your exact location if you are on a highway say in which direction the vehicles were traveling  the type and gravity of the emergency for example “traffic accident two cars road blocked three people trapped”  number gender and age of casualties for example “one man early sixties breathing difficulties suspected heart attack”  details of any hazards such as gas toxic substances powerline damage or adverse weather conditions such as fog or ice once the emergency services arrive they will take over the care of the casualty tell them what has happened and any treatment given hand over any notes you made while attending the casualty you may be asked to continue helping for example by assisting relatives or friends of the casualty while the paramedics provide emergency care you should also follow instructions given to you by the medical team remain until you are told you can go since they may need to ask you more questions or the police may want to speak to you help maintain a clear and clean environment and preserve the dignity and confidentiality of those involved you may be asked to contact a relative explain as simply and honestly as you can what has happenened and where the casualty has been taken do not be vague or exaggerate because this may cause unnecessary alarm it is better to admit ignorance than to give someone misleading information making the call when the emergency services arrive assisting at the scene once the emergency services arrive tell them everything you know while they assess and treat the casualty you may be asked to look after or reassure friends however the information you give may cause distress; if so remain calm and be clear about what to do next becoming a first aider the use of medication remember your own needs in first aid administering medication is largely confined to relieving general aches and pains it usually involves helping a casualty take his own medicines a variety of medications can be bought without a doctor’s prescription however you must not buy or borrow medication to administer to a casualty or give your own if you advise the casualty to take any medication other than that stipulated in this manual he may be put at risk and you could face legal action as a consequence whenever a casualty takes medication it is essential to make sure that  it is for the condition  it is not out of date  it is taken as advised  any precautions are strictly followed  the recommended dose is not exceeded  you keep a record of the name and dose of the medication as well as the time and method of administration most people who learn first aid gain significantly from doing so in addition to learning new skills and meeting new people by learning first aid you can make a real difference in peoples’ lives being able to help people who are ill or injured often results in a range of positive feelings however you may also feel stressed when you are called upon to administer first aid and feel emotional once you have finished treating a casualty whatever the outcome occasionally that stress can interfere with your physical and mental wellbeing after an incident everyone responds to stressful situations in different ways and some people are more susceptible to stress than others it is important to learn how to deal with any stress in order to maintain your own health and effectiveness as a first aider gaining an understanding of your own needs can help you be better prepared for future situations an emergency is an emotional experience many first aiders experience satisfaction or even elation and most cope well however after you have treated a casualty depending on the type of incident and the outcome you might experience a mixture of the following  satisfaction  confusion worry doubt  anger sadness fear you may go through what has happened again and again in your mind so it can be helpful to talk to someone you trust about how you feel and what you did consider talking to someone else who was there or who you know has had a similar experience never reproach yourself or hide your feelings this is especially important if the outcome was not as you had hoped even with appropriate treatment and however hard you try a casualty may not recover immediately after an incident aspirin should never be given to anyone under the age of years because there is risk of a rare condition called reye’s syndrome caution the use of medication remember your own needs delivering first aid can lead to positive feelings because you notice new things about yourself such as your ability to deal with a crisis however occasionally the effect of an incident on you will depend on your first aid experience as well as on the nature of the actual incident the majority of the incidents you will deal with will be of a minor nature and they will probably involve people you know if you have witnessed an incident that involved a threat to life or you have experienced a feeling of helplessness you may find yourself suffering from feelings of stress after the incident in most cases these feelings will disappear over time if however you experience persistent or distressing symptoms associated with a stressful incident such as nightmares and flashbacks seek further help from someone you trust and feel you can confide in see your doctor or a mental health professional if you feel overwhelmed by your symptoms you can talk through them with the professionals and together decide what is best for you seeking help is nothing to be embarrassed about and it is important to overcome these feelings this will not only help you deal with your current reactions but it will also help you learn how to respond to situations in the future later reactions talking things over confiding in a friend or relative is often useful ideally talk to someone who was also present at the incident; she may have the same feelings about it as you if you are unable to deal with the effects of the event you were part of or witnessed seek help from your doctor when to seek help the scene of any incident can present many potential dangers whether someone has become ill or has been injured whether in the home or outside at the scene of an incident before any first aid is provided you must make sure that approaching the scene of the incident does not present unacceptable danger to the casualty or to you or anyone else who is helping this chapter provides advice for first aiders on how to ensure safety in an emergency situation there are specific guidelines for emergencies that pose a particular risk these include fires traffic accidents and incidents involving electricity and drowning the procedures that are used by the emergency services for major incidents where particular precautions are necessary and where first aiders may be called on to help are also described here  to protect yourself from danger and make the area safe  to assess the situation quickly and calmly and summon help if necessary  to assist any casualties and provide necessary treatment with the help of bystanders  to call for emergency help if you suspect serious injury or illness  to be aware of your own needs aims and objectives managing an incident managing an incident action at an emergency in any emergency it is important that you follow a clear plan of action this will enable you to prioritize the demands that may be made upon you and help you decide on your best response the principle steps are to assess the situation to make the area safe if possible and to give first aid use the primary survey pp to identify the most seriously injured casualties and treat them in the order of priority evaluating the scene accurately is one of the most important factors in the management of an incident you should stay calm state that you have first aid training and if there are no medical personnel in attendance calmly take charge identify any safety risks and assess the resources available action for key dangers you may face such as fire are dealt with in this chapter but be aware too of tripping hazards sharp objects chemical spills and falling debris all incidents should be managed in a similar manner consider the following  safety what are the dangers and do they still exist? are you wearing protective equipment? is it safe for you to approach?  scene what factors are involved at the incident? what are the mechanisms of the injuries pp? how many casualties are there? what are the potential injuries?  situation what happened? how many people are involved and what ages are they? are any of them children or elderly? the conditions that give rise to an incident may still present a danger and must be eliminated if possible it may be that a simple measure such as turning off the ignition of a car to reduce the risk of fire is sufficient as a last resort move the casualty to safety usually specialist help and equipment is required for this when approaching a casualty make sure you protect yourself wear highvisibility clothing gloves and head protection if you have them remember too that a casualty faces the risk of injury from the same hazards that you face if extrication from the scene is delayed try to protect the casualty from any additional hazards if you cannot make an area safe call for emergency help before performing first aid stand clear until the emergency services have secured the scene once an area has been made safe use the primary survey pp to quickly carry out an initial assessment of the casualty or casualties to establish treatment priorities if there is more than one casualty attend to those with lifethreatening conditions first if possible treat casualties in the position in which you find them; move them only if they are in immediate danger or if it is necessary in order to provide lifesaving treatment enlist help from others if assessing the situation making an area safe giving emergency help action at an emergency hand over any notes you have made to the emergency services when they arrive p answer any questions they may have and follow any instructions as a first aider you may be asked to help for example to move a casualty using specialist equipment if so you should always follow their instructions helicopter rescue occasionally helicopter rescue is required if a casualty is being rescued in this way there are a number of safety rules to follow if the emergency services are already present you should stay clear unless they give you specific instructions if the emergency services are not present keep bystanders clear make sure everyone is at least yards meters away and that no one is smoking kneel down as the helicopter approaches keeping well away from the rotor blades once it has landed do not approach it keep bystanders back and wait for a member of the crew to approach you assisting the emergency services begin treatment start lifesaving first aid as soon as possible ask others to call for help and retrieve equipment such as an aed automated external defibrillator possible ask bystanders to call for the emergency services p they can also help protect a casualty’s privacy put out flares or warning triangles in the event of a vehicle accident p or retrieve equipment while you begin first aid managing an incident traffic accidents the severity of traffic accidents can range from a fall from a bicycle to a major vehicle crash involving many casualties often the accident site will present serious risks to safety largely because of passing traffic it is essential to make the accident area safe before attending any casualties p; this protects you the casualties and other road users once the area is safe quickly assess the casualties and prioritize treatment give first aid to those with lifethreatening injuries before treating anyone else call for emergency help giving as much detail as you can about the accident indicating number and age of the casualties and types of injury do not put yourself or others in further danger take the following precautions  park safely well away from the site of the accident set your hazard lights flashing and put on a highvisibility jacketvest if you have one  set up warning triangles or flares or position another vehicle that has hazard lights at least yards meters from the accident in each direction; bystanders can do this while you attend to the casualty if possible send helpers to warn oncoming drivers to slow down  make vehicles safe for example switch off the ignition of any damaged vehicle stabilize vehicles if a vehicle is upright and you can get in without risk to yourself apply the emergency brake put it in park or place blocks in front of the wheels if it is on its side do not attempt to right it  watch out for physical dangers such as traffic make sure that no one smokes anywhere near the accident  alert the emergency services to damaged power lines fuel spills or any vehicles with hazmat signs opposite making the accident area safe warn other road users ask a bystander to set up warning triangles in both directions advise the person to watch for other vehicles while she is doing this traffic accidents quickly assess any casualties by carrying out a primary survey pp deal first with those who have lifethreatening injuries assume that any casualty who has been involved in a traffic accident may have a neck or spinal injury pp if possible treat casualties in the position in which you find them supporting the head and neck at all times and wait for the emergency services search the area around the accident thoroughly to make sure you do not overlook any casualty who may have been thrown clear or who has wandered away from the site bystanders can help if a person is trapped in or under a vehicle she will need to be released by the fire department monitor and record the casualty’s vital signs—level of response breathing and pulse pp if trained—while you wait assessing the casualties casualty in a vehicle assume that any injured casualty in a vehicle has a neck injury support the head while you await help reassure her and keep her ears uncovered so that she can hear you  do not cross a highway to attend to an accident or casualty  at night wear or carry something light or reflective such as a highvisibility jacket and use a flashlight  do not move the casualty unless it is absolutely necessary if you do have to move her the method will depend on the casualty’s condition and available help  be aware that road surfaces may be slippery because of fuel oil or even ice  be aware that undeployed air bags and unactivated seatbelt tensioners may be a hazard  find out as much as you can about the accident and relay this information to the emergency services when they arrive traffic accidents may be complicated by spillages of toxic substances or vapors keep bystanders away from the scene and stand upwind of the vehicle hazmat signs on the back of the vehicle indicate that it may be carrying a dangerous substance stay clear and give the details to the emergency services caution special case hazardous substances gases radioactive materials oxidizersorganic peroxides dangerous goods toxic materials corrosive materials flammable liquids flammable solids explosives managing an incident fires fire spreads very quickly so your first priority is to warn any people at risk if in a building activate the nearest fire alarm call for emergency help then leave the building however if doing this delays your escape make the call when you are out of the building as a first aider try to keep everyone calm encourage and assist people to evacuate the area when arriving at an incident involving fire stop observe think do not enter the area a minor fire can escalate in minutes to a serious blaze call for emergency help and wait for it to arrive a fire needs three components to start and maintain it ignition a spark or flame; a source of fuel gasoline wood or fabric; and oxygen air removing one of these elements can break this “triangle of fire”  remove combustible materials such as paper or cardboard from the path of a fire because they can fuel the flames  cut off a fire’s oxygen supply by shutting a door on a fire or smothering the flames with a fire blanket this will cause the fire to suffocate and go out  turn off a car’s ignition or switch off the gasoline supply if you see or suspect a fire in a building activate the first fire alarm you see try to help people out of the building without putting yourself at risk close doors behind you to help prevent the fire from spreading if you are in a public building use the fire exits and look for assembly points outside you should already know the evacuation procedure at your workplace if however you are visiting other premises you are not familiar with follow the signs for escape routes and obey any instructions given by the fire marshals the elements of fire leaving a burning building when escaping from a fire  do not reenter a burning building to collect personal possessions  do not use elevators  do not go back to a building unless cleared to do so by a fire officer fire precautions  do not move anything that is on fire  do not smother flames with flammable materials  do not fight a fire if it could endanger your own safety  if your clothes catch fire and help is not available you can extinguish the flames yourself by stopping dropping to the ground and rolling  do not put water on an electrical fire pull the plug out or switch the power off  smother a grease fire with a fire blanket or pot lid; never use water evacuating other people encourage people to leave the building calmly but quickly via the nearest exit if they have to use the stairs make sure they do not rush and risk falling down caution fires always follow this procedure stop drop and roll  stop the casualty from panicking running around or going outside; any movement or breeze will fan the flames  drop the casualty to the ground if possible wrap him tightly in a fire blanket or heavy fabric such as a coat curtain blanket not a nylon blanket or an openweave type of any material—acrylic wool cotton or other or rug  roll the casualty along the ground until the flames have been smothered treat any burns pp help the casualty lie down with the burned side uppermost and cool the burn by applying cool water or fanning the area gently any fire in a confined space creates a highly dangerous atmosphere that is low in oxygen and may also be polluted by carbon monoxide and other toxic fumes never enter a smoke or fumefilled building or open a door leading to a fire let the emergency services do this  if you are trapped in a burning building if possible go into a room at the front of the building with a window and shut the door block gaps under the door by placing a rug or similar heavy fabric across the bottom of the door to minimize smoke open the window and shout for help  stay low if you have to cross a smokefilled room air is clearest at floor level  if escaping through a high window climb out backward feet first and lower yourself to the full length of your arms before dropping down clothing on fire smoke and fumes putting out flames help the casualty onto the ground to stop flames from rising to his face wrap him in a fire blanket to starve flames of oxygen and roll him on the ground until the flames are extinguished avoiding smoke and fumes shut the door of the room you are in and put a rug or blanket against the door to keep smoke out open the window and shout for help keep as low as possible to avoid fumes in the room managing an incident electrical incidents when a person is electrocuted the passage of electrical current through the body may stun him causing his breathing and heartbeat to stop the electrical current can also cause burns both where it enters and where it exits the body to go to “earth” an electrical burn may appear very small or not be visible on the skin but the damage can extend deep into the tissues p factors that affect the severity of the injury are the voltage; the type of current; and the path of the current a low voltage of  volts is found in most outlets of a home or workplace but large appliances require  volt outlets industrial outlets may be up to volts the type of current will either be alternating ac or direct dc and the path of the current can be handtohand handtofoot or foottofoot most lowvoltage and hightension currents are ac which causes muscular spasms tetany and the “lockedon” phenomenon—the casualty’s grasp is “locked” onto the object preventing him from letting go so he may remain electrically charged “live” in contrast dc tends to produce a single large muscular contraction that often throws the person away from the source be aware that the jolt may cause the casualty to be thrown or to fall resulting in injuries such as spinal injuries and fractures contact with a highvoltage current found in power lines and overhead cables is usually immediately fatal anyone who survives will have severe burns since the temperature of the electricity may reach up to °f °c furthermore the shock produces a muscular spasm that propels the casualty some distance causing additional injuries highvoltage electricity may jump “arc” up to yards m the power must be cut off and isolated before the casualty is approached a casualty who has suffered this type of shock is likely to be unconscious once you have been officially informed that it is safe to approach assess the casualty and if he is not breathing begin cpr with chest compressions pp highvoltage current protect bystanders keep everyone away from the incident bystanders should stay at least yards m from the damaged cable andor casualty  do not touch the casualty if he is in contact with the electrical current  do not use anything metallic to break the electrical contact  do not approach highvoltage wires until the power is turned off  do not move a person with an electrical injury unless he is in immediate danger and is no longer in contact with the electricity  if it is safe to touch the casualty and he is unconscious and not breathing start cpr with chest compressions pp caution electrical incidents domestic current as used in homes and workplaces can cause serious injury or even death incidents are usually due to faulty switches frayed cords or defective appliances young children are at risk because they are naturally curious and may put their fingers or other objects into electrical wall sockets water is also a very efficient conductor of electricity so presents additional risks handling an otherwise safe electrical appliance with wet hands or when you are standing on a wet floor greatly increases the risk of an electric shock a natural burst of electricity discharged from the atmosphere lightning forms an intense trail of light and heat lightning seeks contact with the ground through the nearest tall feature in the landscape and sometimes through anyone standing nearby however the short duration of a lightning strike usually precludes serious thermal injury it may however set clothing on fire knock the casualty down or cause heart and breathing to stop cardiac arrest p cardiopulmonary resuscitationcpr adult pp; child pp; infant pp must be started promptly always clear everyone from the site of a lightning strike since it can strike again in the same place lowvoltage current lightning breaking contact with the electricity before beginning any treatment look first do not touch if the casualty is still in contact with the electrical source he will be “live” and you risk electrocution once you are sure that the power is off and contact between the casualty and the electricity has been broken perform a primary survey pp and treat any condition found call for emergency help turn off the source of electricity to break the contact between the casualty and the electrical supply switch off the current at the circuit box if possible otherwise turn off the electricity at the wall switch if there is one after the power is turned off move the source away from both you and the casualty incidents around water may involve people of any age however drowning is one of the most common causes of accidental death among young people under the age of young children can drown in fish ponds paddling pools bathtubs and even in buckets or the toilet if they fall in head first as well as in swimming pools in the sea and in open water many cases of drowning involve people who have been swimming in strong currents or very cold water or who have been swimming or boating after drinking alcohol there are particular dangers connected with incidents involving swimmers in cold water the sudden immersion in cold water can result in an overstimulation of nerves causing the heart to stop cardiac arrest cold water may cause hypothermia pp and exacerbate shock pp spasm in the throat and inhalation of water can block the airway hypoxia p and drowning p inhaled or swallowed water may be absorbed into the circulatory system causing water overload to the brain heart or lungs the exertion of swimming can also strain the heart such incidents may happen in the winter if someone falls through the ice when skating on a pond or pursuing a pet managing an incident water incidents  if the casualty is unconscious lift him out of the water support his head and neck and carry him his head lower than his chest to keep him from inhaling water and protect the airway if he vomits  if removal from the water cannot be immediate begin rescue breaths while still in the water  when you reach land check for normal breathing and if not begin cpr with compressions pp water rescue your first priority is to get the casualty onto dry land with the minimum of danger to yourself stay on dry land hold out a stick a branch or a rope for him to grab then pull him from the water alternatively throw him a float if you are a trained lifesaver there is no danger to yourself and the casualty is unconscious wade or swim to the casualty and tow him ashore if you cannot do this safely call for emergency help once the casualty is out of the water shield him from the wind if possible treat him for drowning p and the effects of severe cold pp if possible replace any wet clothing with dry clothing arrange to take or send the casualty to the hospital even if he seems to have recovered completely if you are at all concerned call for emergency help caution water incidents major incidentsmass casualties major incidentmass casualties a major incident or mass casualty incident is one that presents a serious threat to the safety of a community or may cause so many casualties that it requires special arrangements from the emergency services events of this kind can overwhelm the resources of the emergency services because there may be more casualties to treat than there are personnel available it is the responsibility of the emergency services to declare a situation to be a mass casualty and certain procedures will be activated by them if necessary the area around the incident will be sealed off and hospitals and emergency response personnel notified organizing this is not a first aider’s responsibility but you may be asked to help if you are the first person on the scene of what may be a mass casualty do not approach it call for emergency help immediately pp the dispatcher will need to know the type of incident that has occurred for example a fire a traffic accident or an explosion the location the access any particular hazards and the approximate number of casualties first the area immediately around the incident will be cordoned off—the inner perimeter around this an outer perimeter the minimum safe area for emergency personnel fire ambulance and police will be established no one without the correct identification and safety equipment will be allowed inside the area the onscene commander typically the fire chief will lead the response triage of casualties will occur and if the scene is safe and conditions permit casualties in need of medical treatment will be moved to a casualty collection point triage the emergency services use a system called triage to assess casualties all casualties undergo a primary survey pp at the scene to establish treatment priorities this will be followed by a secondary survey pp in the casualty collection point this check will be repeated and any change monitored until a casualty recovers or is transferred into the care of a medical team  casualties who cannot walk will undergo further assessment they will be assigned to red priority one immediate or yellow priority two urgent areas for treatment and transferred to a hospital by ambulance as soon as possible  walking casualties with minor injuries will be assigned to the green priority three area for treatment and transferred to a hospital if necessary  uninjured people may be taken to a survivor reception center  dead or critically injured casualties will be assigned to the gray or black categories first aider’s role you will not be allowed to enter the perimeter area without adequate personal safety equipment or approval from emergency services personnel you may be asked to assist the emergency services by for example helping identify casualties that have minor injuries supporting injured limbs making a note of casualties’ names andor helping contact their relatives emergency service scene organization when a person suddenly becomes ill or has been injured it is important to find out what is wrong as quickly as possible however your first priority is to make sure that you are not endangering yourself by approaching a casualty once you are sure that an incident area is safe you need to begin your assessment of the casualty or casualties this chapter explains how to approach each casualty and plan your assessment using a methodical twostage system first to check and treat any lifethreatening conditions according to their priority primary survey then to carry out a detailed assessment looking for injuries that are not immediately apparent secondary survey there is advice on deciding treatment priorities managing more than one casualty and arranging aftercare a casualty’s condition may improve or deteriorate while in your care so there is guidance on how to monitor changes in his condition  to assess a situation quickly and calmly while first protecting yourself and the casualty from any danger  to assess each casualty and treat lifethreatening injuries first  to carry out a more detailed assessment of each casualty  to seek appropriate help call for emergency help if you suspect serious injury or illness  to be aware of your own needs aims and objectives assessing a casualty assessing a casualty assessing the sick or injured from the previous chapters you now know that to ensure the best possible outcome for anyone who is injured or suddenly becomes ill you need to take responsibility for making assessments tell those at the scene that you are a trained first aid provider and calmly take control however as indicated in chapter pp resist the temptation to begin dealing with any casualty until you have the assessed the overall situation ensured that everyone involved is safe and if appropriate taken steps to organize the necessary help as you read this chapter look back at chapter pp and remember the following  be calm  be aware of risks  build and maintain the casualty’s trust  call appropriate help  remember your own needs there are three aspects to this  first find out what is wrong with the casualty  second treat conditions found in order of severity—lifethreatening conditions first  third arrange for the next step of a casualty’s care you will need to decide what type of care a casualty needs you may need to call for emergency help suggest the casualty seeks medical advice or allow him to go home accompanied if you think it is necessary other people at the incident can help you with this ask one of them to call for emergency help while you attend a casualty alternatively they may be able to look after less seriously injured casualties or retrieve first aid equipment managing the injured or sick first actions support the casualty; a bystander may be able to help ask the casualty what happened and try to identify the most serious injury assessing the sick or injured if there is more than one casualty you will need to prioritize those that must be treated first according to the severity of their injuries use the primary survey abc principles above to do this remember that unresponsive casualties are at greatest risk methods of assessment when you assess a casualty you first need to identify and deal with any lifethreatening conditions or injuries—the primary survey deal with each lifethreatening condition as you find it working in the following order— airway breathing circulation—before you progress to the next stage depending on your findings you may not move on to the next stage of the assessment if the lifethreatening injuries are successfully managed or there are none you can continue the assessment and perform a secondary survey the primary survey this is an initial rapid assessment of a casualty to establish and treat conditions that are an immediate threat to life pp if a casualty is conscious suffering from minor injuries and is talking to you then this survey will be completed very quickly if however a casualty is more seriously injured for example unconscious this assessment will take longer follow the airway breathing and circulation abc principle  airway is the airway open and clear? the airway is not open and clear if the casualty is unable to speak an obstructed airway will prevent breathing causing hypoxia p and ultimately death the airway is open and clear if the casualty is talking to you  breathing is the casualty breathing normally? if the casualty is not breathing normally call for emergency help then start chest compressions with rescue breaths cardiopulmonary resuscitationcpr if this happens you are unlikely to move on to the next stage if the casualty is breathing check for and treat any breathing difficulty such as asthma then move on to the next stage circulation  circulation is the casualty bleeding severely? if he is bleeding this must be treated immediately because it can lead to a lifethreatening condition known as shock pp call for emergency help if there is no bleeding continue to the secondary survey the secondary survey this is a detailed examination of a casualty to look for other injuries or conditions that may not be readily apparent on the primary survey pp to do this carry out a headtotoe examination pp your aim is to find out  history what actually happened and any relevant medical history  symptoms injuries or abnormalities that the casualty tells you about  signs injuries or abnormalities that you can see by checking the recognition features of the different injuries and conditions explained in the chapters of this book you can identify what may be wrong record your findings and pass on any relevant information to the medical team level of response you will initially have noted whether or not a casualty is conscious he may have spoken to you or made eye contact or some other gesture p or perhaps there has been no response to your questions such as “are you all right?” or “what happened?” now you need to establish the level of response using the avpu scale p this is important because some illnesses and injuries cause a deterioration in a casualty’s level of response so it is vital to assess the level then monitor him for changes special case several casualties assessing a casualty mechanisms of injury the type of injury that a person sustains is directly related to how the injury is caused whether a casualty sustains a single injury or multiple injuries is also determined by the mechanisms that caused it this is the reason why a history of the incident is important in many situations this vital information can be obtained only by those people who deal with the casualty at the scene—often first aiders look too at the circumstances in which an injury was sustained and the forces that were involved the information is useful because it also helps the emergency services and medical team predict the type and severity of injury as well as the treatment this therefore helps the diagnosis treatment and likely outcome for the casualty circumstances of injury the extent and type of injuries sustained due to impact—for example a fall from a height or the impact of a car crash—can be predicted if you know exactly how the incident happened for example a car occupant is more likely to sustain serious injuries in a sideimpact collision than in a frontal collision at the same speed this is because the side of the car provides less protection and cannot absorb as much energy as the front of the vehicle for a driver wearing a seatbelt whose vehicle is struck either headon or from behind a specific pattern of injuries can be suspected the driver’s body will be suddenly propelled one way but the driver’s head will lag behind briefly before moving this results in a “whiplashing” movement of the neck below the casualty may also have injuries caused by the seatbelt restraint; for example fracture of the breastbone and possibly bruising of the heart or lungs there may be injuries to the face due to contact with the steering wheel or an inflated airbag whiplash the head may be whipped backward and then rapidly forward or vice versa due to sudden forces on the body such as in a car crash this produces a whiplash injury with strained muscles and stretched ligaments in the neck mechanisms of injury most serious injury may be hidden a first aider should keep the casualty still ask someone to support her head and call for emergency help forces exerted on the body the energy forces exerted during an impact are another important indicator of the type or severity of any injury for example if a man falls from a height of feet m or less onto hard ground he will probably suffer bruising but no serious injury a fall from a height of more than feet m however is more likely to produce more serious injuries such as a pelvic fracture or internal bleeding an apparently less serious fall can mask a more dangerous injury a fall from a standing position in susceptible people like the elderly those suffering from bone disorders or those who taking blood thinners can result in serious head or other injuries questions to ask at the scene when you are attending a casualty ask the casualty or any witnesses questions to try to find out the mechanism of the injury witnesses are especially important if the casualty is unable to talk to you possible questions include  was the casualty ejected from a vehicle?  was the casualty wearing a seat belt?  did the vehicle roll over?  was the casualty wearing a helmet?  how far did the casualty fall?  what type of surface did she land on?  is there evidence of body contact with a solid object such as the floor a coffee table or a vehicle’s windshield?  how did she fall? for example twisting falls can stretch or tear the ligaments or tissues around a joint such as the knee or ankle pass on all the information that you have gathered to the emergency services pp and  assessing a casualty primary survey the primary survey is a quick systematic assessment of a casualty to establish if any conditions or injuries sustained are life threatening by following a methodical sequence using established techniques each lifethreatening condition can be identified in a priority order and dealt with on a “find and treat” basis the sequence should be applied to every casualty you attend you should not allow yourself to be distracted from it by other events the chart opposite guides you through this sequence depending on your findings you may not move on to the next stage of the assessment only when lifethreatening conditions are successfully managed or there are none should you perform a secondary survey pp response at this point you need to make a quick assessment to find out whether a casualty is conscious or unconscious observe the casualty as you approach introduce yourself even if he does not appear to be responding to you ask the casualty some questions such as “what happened?” or “are you all right?” or give a command such as “open your eyes!” if there is no initial response gently shake the casualty’s shoulders if the casualty is a child tap his shoulder; if he is an infant tap his foot if there is still no response he is unconscious if the casualty responds and makes eye contact or some other gesture he is conscious unconscious casualties take priority and require urgent treatment pp airway the first step is to check that a casualty’s airway is open and clear if a casualty is alert and talking to you it follows that the airway is open and clear if however a casualty is unconscious the airway may be obstructed p you need to open and clear the airway adult p; child p; infant p—do not move on to the next stage until it is open and clear breathing is the casualty breathing normally? look listen and feel for breaths if he is alert andor talking to you he will be breathing however it is important to note the rate depth and ease with which he is breathing for example conditions such as asthma p that cause breathing difficulty require urgent treatment if an unconscious casualty is not breathing the heart will stop chest compressions and rescue breaths cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr must be started immediately adult pp; child pp; infant pp circulation conditions that affect the circulation of blood can be life threatening injuries that result in severe bleeding p can cause blood loss from the circulatory system so they must be treated immediately to minimize the risk of a lifethreatening condition known as shock pp only when lifethreatening conditions have been stabilized or there are none present should you make a detailed secondary survey of the casualty pp if you see the casualty suddenly lose consciousness and fall to the ground or other witnesses describe those symptoms assume sudden cardiac arrest and immediately start cpr with chest compressions pp special case sudden cardiac arrest primary survey the abc check if lifethreatening conditions are managed or there are none present move on to the secondary survey pp to check for other injury or illness circulation are there any signs of severe bleeding? unconscious conscious unconscious conscious airway is the casualty’s airway open and clear adult pp; child pp; infant p? breathing is the casualty breathing normally? look listen and feel for breaths  if the casualty is conscious treat conditions such as choking or suffocation that cause the airway to be blocked go to the next stage breathing when the airway is open and clear  if the casualty is unconscious tilt the head and lift the chin to open the airway adult p; child p; infant p go to the next stage breathing when the airway is open and clear  treat any difficulty found; for example asthma go to the next stage circulation   if the casualty is unconscious and not breathing call for emergency help begin chest compressions and rescue breaths adult pp; child pp; infant pp if this happens you are unlikely to move on to the next stage  control the bleeding pp call for emergency help treat the casualty to minimize the risk of shock pp no yes yes yes no no assessing a casualty secondary survey once you have completed the primary survey and dealt with any lifethreatening conditions start the methodical process of checking for other injuries or illnesses by performing a headtotoe examination this is called the secondary survey question the casualty and the people around him make a note of your findings if you can and pass all the details to the emergency services or hospital or whoever takes responsibility for the casualty p ideally the casualty should remain in the position found at least until you are satisfied that it is safe to move him into a more comfortable position appropriate for his injury or illness this survey includes two further checks beyond the abc pp  disability is the casualty’s level of response p  examine the casualty you may need to remove or cut away clothing to examine andor treat the injuries by conducting this survey you are aiming to discover the following  history what happened leading up to the injury or sudden illness and any relevant medical history  symptoms information that the casualty gives you about his condition  signs you find on examination of the casualty history there are two important aspects to the history what happened and any previous medical history event history the first consideration is to find out what happened your initial questions should help you discover the immediate events leading up to the incident the casualty can usually tell you this but sometimes you have to rely on information from people nearby so it is important to verify that they are telling you facts and not just their opinions there may also be clues such as the impact on a vehicle which can indicate the likely nature of the casualty’s injury this is often referred to as the mechanism of injury pp previous medical history the second aspect to consider is a person’s medical history while this may have nothing to do with the present condition it could be a clue to the cause clues to the existence of such a condition may include a medical bracelet or medication in the casualty’s possessions p taking a history  ask what happened; for example establish whether the incident is due to illness or an accident  ask about medication the casualty is taking  ask about medical history find out if there are ongoing and previous conditions  find out if a person has any allergies including to any medications or latex  check when the person last had something to eat or drink  note the presence of a medical warning bracelet—this may indicate an ongoing medical condition such as epilepsy diabetes or anaphylaxis secondary survey listen to the casualty make eye contact with the casualty as you talk to him keep your questions simple and listen carefully to the symptoms he describes symptoms these are the sensations that the casualty feels and describes to you when you talk to the casualty ask him to give you as much detail as possible for example if he complains of pain ask where it is ask him to describe the pain is it constant or intermittent sharp or dull ask him what makes the pain better or worse whether it is affected by movement or breathing and if it did not result from an injury where and how it began the casualty may describe other symptoms too such as nausea giddiness heat cold or thirst listen very carefully to his answers p and do not interrupt him while he is speaking signs these are features such as swelling bleeding discoloration deformity and smells that you can detect by observing and feeling the casualty rather than asking the casualty questions use your senses—look listen feel and smell—to get a complete picture always compare the injured and uninjured sides of the body you may also notice that the person is unable to perform normal functions such as moving his limbs or standing make a note of any obvious superficial injuries going back to treat them only when you have completed your examination compare both sides of the body always compare the injured part of the body with the uninjured side check for swelling deformity and discoloration quick reminder use the mnemonic a m p l e as a reminder when assessing a casualty to ensure that you have covered all aspects of the casualty's history when the emergency services arrive they may ask a—allergy—does the person have any allergies? m—medications—is the person on any medication? p—previous medical history—do you know of any preexisting conditions? l—last meal—when did the person last eat? e—event history—what happened? » assessing a casualty « secondary survey look for external clues as part of your assessment look for external clues to a casualty’s condition if you suspect drug abuse take care because he may be carrying needles and syringes you may find an appointment card for a hospital or clinic or a card indicating a history of allergy diabetes or epilepsy horsebackriders or cyclists may carry such a card inside their riding hat or helmet food or medication may also give valuable clues about the casualty’s condition; for example people with diabetes may carry sugar packets or glucose gel a person with a known disorder may have medical warning information on a special bracelet or medallion such as a “medicalert” keep any such item with the casualty or give it to the emergency services if you need to search a casualty’s belongings always try to ask first and perform the search in front of a reliable witness p medication a casualty may be carrying medication such as antiinflammatories for back pain or nitroglycerine for angina medical bracelet this may be inscribed with information about a casualty’s medical history eg epilepsy diabetes or anaphylaxis or there may be a number to call pufferinhaler the presence of an inhaler usually indicates that the casualty has asthma or other diseases that can cause wheezing or difficulty breathing insulin pen this may indicate that a person has diabetes the casualty may also have a glucose testing kit autoinjector this contains epinephrine adrenaline for people at risk of anaphylactic shock the pens are color coded for adult and child doses medical clues secondary survey headtotoe examination » once you have taken the casualty’s history p and asked about any symptoms she has p you should carry out a detailed examination use your senses when you examine a casualty look listen feel and smell always start at the head and work down; this “headtotoe” routine is both easily remembered and thorough you may have to open cut away or remove clothing that is covering an injury or if the casualty feels pain in a particular area always be sensitive to a casualty’s privacy and dignity and ask her permission before doing this protect yourself and the casualty by wearing disposable gloves make sure that you do not move the casualty more than is strictly necessary if possible examine a conscious casualty in the position in which you find her or one that best suits her condition unless her life is in immediate danger if an unconscious breathing casualty has been placed in the recovery position leave her in this position while you carry out the headtotoe examination check the casualty’s breathing and pulse rates pp then work from her head downward initially note minor injuries but continue your examination to make sure that you do not miss any concealed potentially serious conditions; return to them only when you have completed your examination headtotoe examination  pain  anxiety  heat  cold  loss of sensation  abnormal sensation  thirst  nausea  tingling  pain on touch or pressure  faintness  stiffness  momentary unconsciousness  weakness  memory loss  dizziness  sensation of

crepitus  acetone  alcohol  burning  gas or fumes  solvents or glue  urine  feces  cannabis possible findings on carrying out an examination assessing a casualty look at the skin note the color and temperature is it pale flushed or grayblue cyanosis; is it hot or cold dry or damp? pale cold sweaty clammy skin suggests shock; a flushed hot face suggests fever or heatstroke a blue tinge indicates lack of oxygen; look for this in the lips ears and face check the nose for discharges as you did for the ears look for clear fluid or watery blood or a mixture of both coming from either nostril soot around the nostrils or singed nasal hairs might indicate serious airway burns  look in the mouth for anything that might obstruct the airway if the casualty has dentures that are intact and fit firmly leave them look for mouth wounds or burns and check for irregularity in the line of the teeth headtotoe examination loosen clothing around the neck and look for signs such as a medical warning necklace p or a hole stoma in the windpipe run your fingers gently along the spine from the base of the skull down as far as possible without moving the casualty; check for irregularity swelling tenderness or deformity assess breathing p check the rate fast or slow depth shallow or deep and nature is it easy or difficult noisy or quiet check the pulse p assess the rate fast or slow rhythm regular or irregular and strength strong or weak start the physical examination at the casualty's head run your hands carefully over the scalp to feel for bleeding swelling or depression which may indicate a fracture be careful not to move the casualty if you suspect that she may have injured her neck what to do  « speak clearly to the casualty in both ears to find out if she responds or if she can hear look for clear fluid or watery blood coming from either ear these discharges may be signs of a serious head injury pp examine both eyes note whether they are open check the size of the pupils the black area if the pupils are not the same size it may indicate head injury look for any foreign object or blood in the whites of the eyes  headtotoe examination check that the casualty has no abnormal sensations in the arms or fingers if the fingertips are pale or grayblue there may be a problem with blood circulation look out for needle marks on the forearms or a medical warning bracelet p if there is any impairment in movement or loss of sensation in the limbs do not move the casualty to examine the spine since these signs suggest spinal injury otherwise gently pass your hand under the hollow of the back and check for swelling and tenderness  gently feel the casualty’s abdomen to detect any evidence of bleeding and to identify any rigidity or tenderness of the abdomen’s muscular wall which could be a sign of internal bleeding compare one side of the abdomen with the other note any bruising on the abdomen or pelvis check the legs look and feel for bleeding swelling deformity or tenderness ask the casualty to raise each leg in turn and to move her ankles and knees feel both sides of the hips and examine the pelvis for signs of fracture check clothing for any evidence of incontinence which suggests spinal or bladder injury or bleeding from orifices which suggests pelvic fracture  check the movement and feeling in the toes check that the vicitm has no abnormal sensations in her feet or toes compare the feet look at the skin color grayblue skin may indicate a circulatory disorder or an injury due to cold look at the chest ask the casualty to breathe deeply and note whether the chest expands evenly easily and equally on both sides feel the rib cage to check for deformity irregularity or tenderness ask the casualty if she is aware of grating sensations when breathing and listen for unusual sounds note whether breathing causes any pain look for any external injuries such as bleeding or stab wounds feel along the collarbones shoulders upper arms elbows hands and fingers for any swelling tenderness or deformity check the movements of the elbows wrists and fingers by asking the casualty to bend and straighten each joint  assessing a casualty monitoring vital signs when treating a casualty you may need to assess and monitor his breathing pulse and level of response this information can help you identify problems and indicate changes in a casualty’s condition monitoring should be repeated regularly and your findings recorded and handed over to the medical assistance taking over p in addition if a casualty has a condition that affects his body temperature such as fever heatstroke or hypothermia you will also need to monitor his temperature you need to monitor a casualty’s level of response to assess her level of consciousness and any change in her condition any injury or illness that affects the brain may affect consciousness and any deterioration is potentially serious assess the level of response using the avpu scale right and make a note of any deterioration or improvement  a—is the casualty alert? are her eyes open and does she respond to questions?  v—does the casualty respond to voice? can she answer questions and obey commands?  p—does the casualty respond to pain? does she open her eyes or move if pinched?  u—is the casualty unresponsive to any stimulus ie unconscious? level of response when assessing a casualty’s breathing check the breathing rate and listen for any breathing difficulties or unusual noises an adult’s normal breathing rate is  breaths per minute; in babies and young children it is  breaths per minute when checking breathing listen for breaths and watch the casualty’s chest movements for a baby or young child it might be easier to place your hand on the chest and feel for movement of breathing record the following information  rate—count the number of breaths per minute  depth—are the breaths deep or shallow  ease—are the breaths easy difficult or painful?  noise—is the breathing quiet or noisy and if noisy what are the types of noise? breathing checking a casualty’s breathing rate observe the chest movements and count the number of breaths per minute use a watch to time breaths for a baby or young child place your hand on the chest and feel for movement monitoring vital signs brachial pulse place the pads of two fingers on the inner side of an infant’s upper arm digital thermometer used to measure temperature under the tongue or in the armpit leave it in place until it makes a beeping sound about seconds then read the display radial pulse place the pads of two or three fingers below the wrist creases at the base of the thumb forehead thermometer a heatsensitive strip for use on a small child hold against the child’s forehead for about seconds the color on the strip indicates temperature carotid pulse place the pads of two fingers in the hollow between the large neck muscle and the windpipe ear sensor place the probe inside the ear press the measurement key wait for a beeping sound then read the display this thermometer can be used while a person is asleep pulse body temperature each heartbeat creates a wave of pressure as blood is pumped along the arteries pp where arteries lie close to the skin surface such as on the inside of the wrist and at the neck this pressure wave can be felt as a pulse the normal pulse rate in adults is  beats per minute the rate is faster in children and may be slower in very fit adults an abnormally fast or slow pulse may be a sign of illness the pulse may be felt at the wrist radial pulse or if this is not possible the neck carotid pulse in babies the pulse in the upper arm brachial pulse is easier to find when checking a pulse use your fingers not your thumb and press lightly against the skin record the following points  rate number of beats per minute  strength strong or weak  rhythm regular or irregular although not a vital sign low or high body temperature may be an important indicator of a lifethreatening problem you can feel exposed skin but use a thermometer to obtain an accurate reading normal body temperature is °f °c but can be slightly higher or lower a temperature above ºf ºc is usually caused by infection but can be the result of heat exhaustion or heatstroke pp a lower body temperature may result from exposure to cold andor wet conditions—hypothermia p—or it may be a sign of lifethreatening infection or shock pp there are several different types of thermometer; see below to stay alive we need an adequate supply of oxygen to enter the lungs and be transferred to all cells in the body by the circulating blood if a person is deprived of oxygen for any length of time the brain will begin to fail as a result the casualty will eventually lose consciousness breathing will cease the heart will stop and death results the airway must be kept open so that breathing can occur allowing oxygen to enter the lungs and be circulated in the body the priority of a first aider when treating any unconscious casualty is to assess for breathing and immediately begin cpr with chest compressions if breathing is absent an automated external defibrillator aed may be required to “shock” the heart back into a normal rhythm this chapter outlines the priorities to remember when dealing with a casualty who has lost consciousness for any reason there are important differences in the treatment of unconscious children and adults; this chapter gives separate stepbystep instructions for dealing with each of these groups  to maintain an open airway to check breathing and resuscitate if required  to call for emergency help aims and objectives the unconscious casualty the unconscious casualty breathing and circulation oxygen is essential to support life without it cells in the body die—those in the brain survive only a few minutes without oxygen oxygen is taken in when we inhale pp and it is then circulated to all the body tissues via the circulatory system p it is vital to maintain breathing and circulation in order to sustain life the process of breathing enables air which contains oxygen to be taken into the air sacs alveoli in the lungs here the oxygen is transferred across blood vessel walls into the blood where it combines with blood cells at the same time the waste product of breathing carbon dioxide is released and exhaled in the breath when oxygen has been transferred to the blood cells it is carried from the lungs to the heart through the pulmonary veins the heart pumps the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body via blood vessels called arteries after oxygen is given up to the body tissues deoxygenated blood is brought back to the heart by blood vessels called veins p the heart pumps this blood to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries where the carbon dioxide is released and the blood is reoxygenated before circulating around the body again see also how breathing works p the heart and blood vessels pp the respiratory system pp how the heart and lungs work together air containing oxygen is taken into the lungs via the mouth and nose blood is pumped from the heart to the lungs where it absorbs oxygen oxygenated blood is returned to the heart before being pumped around the body exchange of gases in the air sacs carbon dioxide passes out of blood cells into air sacs alveoli oxygen crosses the walls of alveoli into blood cells red blood cell air sac alveolus lungs heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body direction of carbon dioxide flow direction of oxygen flow oxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the heart fresh oxygen is drawn into the lungs via the nose and mouth by the windpipe trachea oxygenated blood leaves the heart to be circulated around the body via the aorta deoxygenated blood returns from body tissue to the heart deoxygenated blood is pumped to the lungs by the heart through the pulmonary arteries breathing and circulation lifesaving priorities lifesaving priorities the procedures set out in this chapter can maintain a casualty’s circulation and breathing until emergency help arrives with an unconscious casualty who is not breathing normally your priorities can be remembered by the initials cab upon determining that the casualty is not breathing begin chest compressions c immediately to maintain blood circulation to get oxygenated blood to the tissues after providing the initial circulation for the casualty it is important to maintain an open airway a and to breathe for the casualty b to get oxygen into the body in an adult during the first minutes after the heart stops cardiac arrest the blood oxygen level remains constant so chest compressions are more important than rescue breaths in the initial phase of resuscitation after two to four minutes the blood oxygen level falls and rescue breathing becomes important as well the combination of chest compressions and rescue breaths is called cardiopulmonary resuscitation or cpr in a child or infant a problem with breathing is the most likely reason for the heart to stop in addition to cpr a machine called an automated external defibrillator aed can be used to deliver an electric shock that may restore a normal heartbeat pp chest compressiononly cpr if you have not had any formal training in cpr or you are unwilling or unable to give rescue breaths you can give chest compressions only the dispatcher will give instructions for performing chest compressiononly cpr pp call for emergency help look for an available aed or send a bystander for one chest compressions and rescue breaths are

stabilizes the casualty’s condition early advanced care early defibrillation early help early cpr » chain of survival four elements increase the chances of a collapsed casualty surviving if any one of the elements in this chain is missing the chances of survival are reduced the unconscious casualty if the heart stops beating blood does not circulate through the body as a result vital organs—most importantly the brain—become starved of oxygen brain cells are unable to survive for more than three to four minutes without a supply of oxygen some circulation can be maintained artificially by chest compressions pp these act as a mechanical aid to the heart in order to get blood flowing around the body pushing vertically down on the center of the chest increases the pressure in the chest cavity expelling blood from the heart and forcing it into the tissues as pressure on the chest is released the chest recoils or comes back up and more blood is “sucked” into the heart; this blood is then forced out of the heart by the next compression to ensure that the blood is supplied with enough oxygen chest compressions should be combined with rescue breathing opposite however even if you do not feel comfortable providing rescue breaths or are not trained to do so it is very important that you still provide chest compressions a machine called an aed automated external defibrillator can be used to attempt to restart the heart when it has stopped pp the earlier the aed is used the greater the chance of the casualty surviving with each minute’s delay the casualty’s chances of survival fall aeds can be used safely and effectively without training these machines can now be found in many public places such as railroad and bus stations shopping centers airports and government buildings they are generally housed in cabinets often marked with a lightning bolt and placed where they can be easily found and accessed the cabinets are not locked but most are fitted with an alarm that is activated when the door is opened restoring heart rhythm importance of maintaining circulation using an automated external defibrillator giving chest compressions «lifesaving priorities lifesaving

the casualty’s breathing becomes difficult and noisy and may stop lifting the chin and tilting the head back lifts the tongue away from the entrance to the air passage allowing delivery of rescue breaths exhaled air contains about percent oxygen only five percent less than inhaled air and a small amount of carbon dioxide your exhaled breath therefore contains enough oxygen to supply another person with oxygen—and potentially keep him alive—when it is forced into his lungs during rescue breathing by giving rescue breaths p you force air into his air passages this reaches the air sacs alveoli in the lungs and oxygen is then transferred through tiny blood vessels capillaries to red blood cells when you take your mouth away from the casualty’s his chest falls and air containing waste products is pushed out or exhaled from his lungs this process performed together with chest compressions pp can supply the tissues with oxygen until help arrives an open airway breathing for a

casualty is not responsive and not breathing or just gasping you must begin chest compressions if the casualty is breathing place him in the recovery position if you find the casualty slumped or not on his back and you do not suspect a spinal injury first place him on his back so that you can best assess him on discovering a collapsed casualty you should first make sure the scene is safe and then establish whether he is conscious or unconscious do this by gently shaking the casualty’s shoulders ask “what happened?” or give a command such as “open your eyes” always speak loudly and clearly to the casualty how to check response if there is no further danger leave the casualty in the position in which he was found check for lifethreatening injuries and summon help if needed shout for help leave the casualty in the position in which he was found and assess for breathing treat any condition found and monitor and record vital signs—level of response breathing and pulse pp—until emergency help arrives or the casualty recovers if you are unable to assess the casualty for breathing in the position in which he was found get help to turn him over using the logroll technique p if seeking

remove the pads at any point even if the casualty appears to have recovered  it does not matter if the aed pads are reversed if you put them on the wrong way do not remove and replace them; it wastes time and the pads may not stick to the chest properly when they are reattached the aed will start analyzing the heart rhythm make sure that no one is touching the casualty follow the oral andor visual prompts given by the machine opposite what to do  switch on the aed and take the pads out of the sealed pack remove or cut through clothing and wipe away sweat from the chest remove the backing paper and attach the pads to the casualty’s chest in the positions indicated place the first pad on the casualty’s upper right side just below his collarbone place the second pad on the casualty’s left side just below his armpit inset above make sure the pad has its long axis along the headtotoe axis of the casualty’s body caution the aed will start to give you a series of visual and verbal prompts as soon as it is switched on there are several different aed models available each of which has voice prompts you should always follow the prompts given by the aed that you are using until advanced emergency care is available sequence of aed instructions how to use an aed  switch on the aed  attach pads to casualty’s chest the aed reanalyzes heart rhythm the aed reanalyzes heart rhythm  if the casualty shows signs of regaining consciousness such as coughing opening his eyes speaking or moving purposefully and starts to breathe normally place him in the recovery position pp leave the aed attached to the casualty aed advises that a shock is needed the machine charges up aed instructs you to deliver the shock  make sure everyone is clear of the casualty  depending on the type of aed it will either deliver the shock automatically or instruct you to push the shock button the casualty may appear to “jump” with each shock; this is quite normal aed instructs you to continue cpr for two minutes before it reanalyzes heart rhythm aed instructs you to continue cpr for two minutes before it reanalyzes heart rhythm aed advises that no shock is needed aed gets ready to analyze the casualty’s heart rhythm it may state “stand clear analyzing now” or “analyzing” make sure that no one is touching the casualty is a shock advised? » yes no the use of an aed is occasionally complicated by underlying medical conditions external factors clothing or the cause of the cardiac arrest the safety of all concerned should always be your first consideration clothing and jewelry any clothing or jewelry that could interfere with pads should be removed or cut away normal amounts of chest hair are not a problem but if it prevents good contact between the skin and the pads it should be shaved off ensure that any metal is removed from the area where the pads will be attached remove clothing containing metal such as an underwire bra external factors water or excessive sweat on the chest can reduce the effectiveness of the shock so the chest should be dry if a casualty is rescued from water p dry the chest before applying the aed pads if the casualty is unconscious following an electric shock start cpr immediately after the contact with electricity is broken medical conditions some casualties with heart conditions have a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd this should not stop you from using an aed however if you can see or feel a device under the chest skin do not place the pad directly over it if a casualty has a patch such as a nitroglycerin patch on the chest remove it before you apply the aed pregnant casualties there are no contraindications to using an aed during pregnancy; however the increased breast size may present some problems therefore to place the aed pads correctly you may need to move one or both breasts this must be carried out with respect and dignity considerations when using an aed the unconscious casualty «how to use an aed standard adult aeds can be used on children over the age of eight years for children between the ages of one and eight the smallersized pediatric pads are preferred if they are available if not a standard aed and adult pads can be used when the emergency services arrive continue to resuscitate the child until they take over from you they need to know  casualty’s present status; for example unconscious and not breathing  number of shocks you have delivered  when the casualty collapsed and the length of time he has been unconscious  any relevant history if known if the casualty recovers at any point leave the aed pads attached to his chest ensure that any used materials from the aed cabinet are disposed of as clinical waste p inform the relevant person what has been taken out of the cabinet because it will need to be replaced positioning aed pads on children handing over to the emergency services positioning pediatric aed pads place one pad in the center of the child’s back then place the second pad over the center of the child’s chest make sure both pads are vertical connect the pads to the aed and proceed as described on p using aed pads on a larger child place the pads on the child’s chest as for an adult— one on the child’s upper right side just below his collarbone and the second pad on the child’s left side just below the armpit make sure the long axis of the pad is along the headtotoe axis of the child’s body how to use an aed a manual defibrillator is preferred for infants younger than one year of age but if none is available use an aed with pediatric pads caution oxygen is essential to life every time we inhale air containing oxygen enters the lungs this oxygen is then transferred to the blood to be transported around the body breathing and the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide a waste product from body tissues are described as “respiration” the structures within the body that enable us to breathe— the air passages and the lungs—together make up the respiratory system and work with the heart and circulatory system respiration can be impaired in several different ways the airways may be blocked causing choking or suffocation; the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs may be affected by the inhalation of smoke or fumes; lung function may be impaired by chest injury; or the breathing mechanism may be affected by conditions such as asthma anxiety can also cause breathing difficulties problems with respiration can be lifethreatening and need urgent first aid  to assess the casualty’s condition  to identify and remove the cause of the problem and provide fresh air  to comfort and reassure the casualty  to maintain an open airway check breathing and be prepared to resuscitate if necessary  to obtain medical help if necessary call for emergency help if you suspect a serious illness or injury aims and objectives respiratory problems respiratory problems the respiratory system this system comprises the mouth nose windpipe trachea lungs and pulmonary blood vessels respiration involves the process of breathing and the exchange of gases oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs and in cells throughout the body we inhale air to take oxygen into the lungs and we exhale to expel the waste gas carbon dioxide which is a byproduct of respiration when we inhale air is drawn through the nose and mouth into the airway and the lungs in the lungs oxygen is taken from air sacs alveoli into the pulmonary capillaries at the same time carbon dioxide is released from the capillaries into the alveoli carbon dioxide is then expelled as we exhale an average man’s lungs can hold more than pints liters of air; a woman’s lungs can hold less than pints liters of air structure of the respiratory system the lungs form the central part of the respiratory system together with the circulatory system they perform the vital function of gas exchange in order to distribute oxygen around the body and remove carbon dioxide gas exchange in air sacs a network of tiny blood vessels capillaries surrounds each air sac alveolus the thin walls of both structures allow oxygen to diffuse into the blood and carbon dioxide to leave it epiglottis pulmonary capillary alveolus larynx ribs surround and protect the chest cavity windpipe trachea extends from the larynx to two main bronchi intercostal muscles span spaces between ribs lungs are two spongy organs that occupy a large part of chest cavity pleural membrane which has two layers separated by a lubricating fluid surrounds and protects each of the lungs diaphragm is a sheet of muscle that separates chest and abdominal cavities bronchioles are small air passages that branch from bronchi and eventually open into air sacs alveoli within the lungs two main bronchi one to each lung further subdivide into smaller bronchi then bronchioles bronchiole the respiratory system the breathing process consists of the actions of breathing in inspiration and breathing out expiration followed by a pause pressure differences between the lungs and the air outside the body determine whether air is drawn in or expelled when the air pressure in the lungs is lower than outside air is drawn in; when pressure is higher air is expelled the pressure within the lungs is altered by the movements of the two main sets of muscles involved in breathing the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm breathing is regulated by a group of nerve cells in the brain called the respiratory center this center responds to changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the blood when the level rises the respiratory center reacts by stimulating the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm to contract and a breath occurs our breathing rate can be altered consciously under normal conditions or in response to abnormal levels of carbon dioxide low levels of oxygen or with stress exercise injury or illness how breathing works how breathing is controlled inhaling the intercostal muscles the muscles between the ribs and the diaphragm contract causing the ribs to move up and out the chest cavity to expand and the lungs to expand to fill the space as a result the pressure inside the lungs is reduced and air is drawn into the lungs exhaling the intercostal muscles relax and the rib cage returns to its resting position while the diaphragm relaxes and resumes its domed shape as a result the chest cavity becomes smaller and pressure inside the lungs increases air flows out of the lungs to be exhaled lung inflates lung deflates intercostal muscles between ribs contract ribs rise and swing outward diaphragm returns to domed position intercostal muscles between ribs relax ribs move down and inward diaphragm contracts and moves down respiratory problems

earlobes but as the hypoxia worsens cyanosis affects the rest of the body  anxiety  restlessness  headache  cessation of breathing if the hypoxia is not quickly reversed recognition this condition arises when there is insufficient oxygen in the body tissues there are a number of causes of hypoxia ranging from suffocation choking or poisoning to impaired lung or brain function the condition is accompanied by a variety of symptoms depending on the degree of hypoxia if not treated quickly hypoxia is potentially fatal because a sufficient level of oxygen is vital for the normal function of all the body organs and tissues but especially the brain in a healthy person the amount of oxygen in the air is more than adequate for the body tissues to function normally however in an injured or ill person a reduction in oxygen reaching the tissues results in deterioration of body function mild hypoxia reduces a casualty’s ability to think clearly but the body responds to this by increasing the rate and depth of breathing p however if the oxygen supply to the brain cells is cut off for as little as three to four minutes the brain cells will begin to die all the conditions covered in this

help the casualty to lie down while you support his head and neck recognition your aims caution respiratory problems inhalation of fumes the inhalation of smoke gases such as carbon monoxide or toxic vapors can be lethal a casualty who has inhaled fumes is likely to have low levels of oxygen in his body tissues hypoxia p and therefore needs urgent medical attention do not attempt to carry out a rescue if it is likely to put your own life at risk; fumes that have built up in a confined space will quickly overcome anyone who is not wearing protective equipment smoke inhalation any person who has been enclosed in a confined space during a fire should be assumed to have inhaled smoke smoke from burning plastics foam padding and synthetic wall coverings is likely to contain poisonous fumes casualties who have suffered from fume inhalation should also be examined for other injuries caused by the fire such as external burns inhalation of carbon monoxide carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that is hard to detect because it has no taste or smell the gas acts directly on red blood cells preventing them from carrying oxygen to the body tissues if carbon monoxide is inhaled in large quantities—for example from smoke or vehicle exhaust fumes in a confined space— it can very quickly prove fatal lengthy exposure to even a small amount of carbon monoxide—for example due to a leakage of fumes from a defective heater or flue—may also prove fatal  exhaust fumes of motor vehicles  smoke from most fires  backdrafts from blocked chimney flues  emissions from defective gas or kerosene

him lie down on a rug or coat with his head lower than the rest of the body so that water can drain from his mouth this reduces the risk of inhaling water p treat the casualty for hypothermia; replace wet clothing with dry clothes if possible and cover him with dry blankets or coats if the casualty is fully conscious give him a warm drink  if the casualty is unconscious and you are on your own give cpr for two minutes before you call for emergency help if an unconscious casualty starts to breathe treat him for hypothermia by covering him with warm clothes and blankets if he recovers replace his wet clothes with dry ones if possible and cover him with warm clothes and blankets monitor and record vital signs—breathing pulse and level of response pp—until help arrives call for emergency help even if he appears to recover fully because of the risk of secondary drowning monitor and record his vital signs—level of response breathing and pulse pp—until help arrives caution drowning hyperventilation hyperventilation what to do when speaking to the casualty be firm but kind and reassuring if possible lead the casualty away to a quiet place where she may be able to regain control of her breathing more easily and quickly if this is not possible ask any bystanders to leave encourage the casualty to seek medical advice on preventing and controlling panic attacks in the future  this is commonly a manifestation of acute anxiety and may accompany a panic attack it may occur in individuals who have recently experienced an emotional upset or those with a history of panic attacks the unnaturally fast or deep breathing of hyperventilation causes an increased loss of carbon dioxide from the blood which leads to chemical changes within the blood these changes result in symptoms such as dizziness and trembling as well as tingling in the hands as breathing returns to normal these symptoms will gradually subside  do not advise the casualty to rebreathe her own air from a paper bag because this may aggravate a more serious illness  hyperventilation due to acute anxiety is rare in children look for other causes  be aware that serious illness may also cause rapid breathing and anxiety  unnaturally fast breathing  fast pulse rate  apprehension there may also be  attentionseeking behavior  dizziness or faintness  trembling sweating and dry mouth or marked tingling in the hands  tingling and cramps in the hands and feet and around the mouth  to remove the casualty from the cause of distress  to reassure the casualty and calm her down recognition your aims caution respiratory problems asthma in an asthma attack the muscles of the air passages in the lungs go into spasm as a result the airways become narrowed which makes breathing difficult sometimes there is a recognized trigger for an attack such as an allergy a cold a particular drug or cigarette smoke at other times there is no obvious trigger many sufferers have sudden attacks people with asthma may be treated depending on the severity of their condition with rescue inhalers or nebulizers on a regular basis they can usually deal with their own attacks by using their inhaler at the first sign of an attack but may need help and encouragement what to do keep calm and reassure the casualty get her to take her usual dose of her inhaler; use a spacer if she has one ask her to breathe slowly and deeply sit her down in the position she finds most comfortable; do not let her lie down a mild attack should ease in a few minutes if it does not ask the casualty to take another dose from her inhaler

casualty inhale the medication more effectively they are especially useful when giving medication to young children special case using a spacer caution asthma croup croup what to do sit your child on your knee supporting her back calmly reassure the child try not to panic because this will only alarm her which is likely to make the attack worse if it is safe to do so create a steamy atmosphere take the child into the bathroom and run a hot faucet or shower or boil some water in the kitchen keep the child away from hot running water or steam call medical help or if the croup is severe call for emergency help keep monitoring her vital signs— level of response breathing and pulse pp—until help arrives  croup can cause an attack of breathing difficulty in young children it is caused by a viral infection in the windpipe and larynx although croup can be alarming it usually passes without lasting harm attacks of croup usually occur at night and are made worse if the child is crying and distressed if an attack of croup persists or is severe and accompanied by fever call for emergency help there is a small risk that the child is suffering from a rare crouplike condition called epiglottitis in which the epiglottis p a small flaplike structure in the throat becomes infected and swollen and may block the airway completely most children are now immunized against the bacterium that causes epiglottitis  distressed breathing in a young child there may also be  a short barking cough  a rasping noise especially on inhaling stridor  croaky voice  bluegray skin cyanosis  in severe cases the child uses muscles around the nose neck and upper arms in trying to breathe suspect epiglottitis if  a child is in respiratory distress and not improving  the child has a high temperature  to comfort and support the child  to obtain medical help if necessary  do not put your fingers down the child’s throat this can cause the throat muscles to go into spasm and block the airway recognition your aims caution respiratory problems penetrating chest wound see also hypoxia p shock pp the unconscious casualty pp the heart and lungs and the major blood vessels around them lie in the chest protected by the breastbone and the rib cage the rib cage also extends far enough down to protect organs such as the liver and spleen in the upper part of the abdomen if a sharp object penetrates the chest wall there may be severe damage to the organs in the chest and the upper abdomen and this may lead to shock the lungs are particularly susceptible to injury either by being damaged themselves or from wounds that perforate the twolayered membrane pleura that surrounds and protects each lung air can then enter between the membranes and exert pressure on the lung and the lung may collapse—a condition called pneumothorax pressure around the affected lung may build up to such an extent that it affects the uninjured lung and the casualty becomes increasingly breathless in a tension pneumothorax this pressure buildup may prevent the heart from refilling with blood properly impairing the circulation and causing shock sometimes blood collects in the pleural cavity a hemothorax and puts pressure on the lungs  to seal the wound and maintain breathing  to minimize shock  to arrange urgent removal to the hospital your aims  difficult and painful breathing possibly

same position as long as he remains conscious monitor and record the casualty’s vital signs—level of response breathing and pulse pp—until emergency help arrives what to do special case if the casualty is unconscious the heart and blood vessels are collectively known as the circulatory cardiovascular system this system keeps the body supplied with blood which carries oxygen and nutrients to all body tissues the circulatory system may be disrupted by either severe internal or external bleeding or fluid loss for example from burns pp the techniques described in this section show how you can help maintain an adequate blood supply to the heart and brain following injury or illness affecting the circulatory system a break in the skin or the internal body surfaces is known as a wound wounds can be daunting particularly if there is a lot of bleeding but prompt action reduces the amount of blood loss and minimizes shock treatments for all circulatory conditions and types of wounds are covered in this chapter  to assess the casualty’s condition quickly and calmly  to control blood loss by applying pressure and elevating the injured part  to minimize the risk of shock  to comfort and reassure the casualty  to call for emergency help if you suspect a serious injury or illness  to be aware of your own needs including the need to protect yourself against bloodborne infections aims and objectives wounds and circulation the heart and blood vessels key the heart and the blood vessels make up the circulatory system these structures supply the body with a constant flow of blood which brings oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and carries waste products away blood is pumped around the body by rhythmic contractions beats of the heart muscle the blood runs through a network of vessels divided into three types arteries veins and capillaries the force that is exerted by the blood flow through the main arteries is called blood pressure the pressure varies with the strength and phase of the heartbeat the elasticity of the arterial walls and the volume and thickness of the blood wounds and circulation how blood circulates oxygenated blood passes from the lungs to the heart then travels to body tissues via the arteries blood that has given up its oxygen deoxygenated blood returns to the heart through the veins capillary networks a network of fine blood vessels capillaries links arteries and veins within body tissues oxygen and nutrients pass from the blood into the tissues; waste products pass from the tissues into the blood through capillaries the heart this muscular organ pumps blood around the body and then to the lungs to pick up oxygen coronary blood vessels supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients carotid artery brachial vein jugular vein aorta heart muscle superior vena cava coronary artery inferior vena cava capillary small artery arteriole small vein venule radial vein femoral vein pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to lungs pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from lungs to heart heart pumps blood around body vena cava carries deoxygenated blood from body tissues to heart brachial artery radial artery femoral artery aorta carries oxygenated blood to body tissues pulmonary artery vessels carrying oxygenated blood vessels carrying deoxygenated blood key the heart pumps blood by muscular contractions called heartbeats which are controlled by electrical impulses generated in the heart each beat has three phases diastole when the blood enters the heart; atrial systole when it is squeezed out of the atria collecting chambers; and ventricular systole when blood leaves the heart in diastole the heart relaxes oxygenated blood from the lungs flows through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium blood that has given up its oxygen to body tissues deoxygenated blood flows from the venae cavae large veins that enter the heart into the right atrium in atrial systole the two atria contract and the valves between the atria and the ventricles pumping chambers open so that blood flows into the ventricles during ventricular systole the ventricles contract the thickwalled left ventricle forces blood into the aorta main artery which carries it to the rest of the body the right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary arteries which carry it to the lungs to collect more oxygen how the heart functions the heart and blood vessels blood flow through the heart the heart’s right side pumps deoxygenated blood from the body to the lungs the left side pumps oxygenated blood to the body via the aorta the blood cells red blood cells contain hemoglobin a red pigment that enables the cells to carry oxygen white blood cells play a role in defending the body against infection platelets help blood clot

weight liter per kg of blood in the average adult body roughly percent of the blood is clear yellow fluid plasma in this fluid are suspended the red and white blood cells and the platelets all of which make up the remaining percent composition of blood vessels carrying oxygenated blood vessels carrying deoxygenated blood bleeding and types of wound when a blood vessel is damaged the vessel constricts and a series of chemical reactions occur to form a blood clot—a “plug” over the damaged area below if large blood vessels are torn or severed uncontrolled blood loss may occur before clotting can take place and shock pp may develop types of bleeding bleeding hemorrhage is characterized by the type of blood vessel that is damaged arteries carry oxygenated blood under pressure from the heart if an artery is damaged bleeding will be profuse blood will spurt out with each heartbeat if a main artery is severed the volume of circulating blood will fall rapidly blood from veins having given up its oxygen into the tissues is darker red it is under less pressure than arterial blood but vein walls can widen greatly and the blood can “pool” inside them varicose vein if a large or varicose vein is damaged blood will gush from it profusely bleeding from capillaries occurs with any wound at first bleeding may be brisk but blood loss is usually slight a blow may rupture capillaries under the skin causing bleeding into the tissues bruising when a blood vessel is severed or damaged it constricts narrows in order to prevent excessive amounts of blood from escaping injured tissue cells at the site of the wound together with specialized blood cells called platelets then trigger a series of chemical reactions that result in the formation of a substance that forms a mesh this mesh traps blood cells to make a blood clot the clot releases a fluid known as serum which contains antibodies and specialized cells; this serum begins the process of repairing the damaged area at first the blood clot is a jellylike mass fibroblast cells form a plug within the clot later this dries into a crust scab that seals and protects the site of the wound until the healing process is complete how wounds heal wounds and circulation injury at the site of injury platelets in the blood arrive to begin formation of a clot other cells are attracted to the site to help with repair clotting a clot is formed by platelets in the blood and bloodclotting protein tissueforming cells migrate to the damaged area to start repair plugging and scabbing a plug of fibrous tissue is formed within the clot the plug hardens and forms a scab that eventually drops off when skin beneath it is healed blood clot new tissue site of injury epidermis dermis plug of fibrous tissue severed blood vessel fibroblast wounds can be classified into a number of different types depending on the object that produces the wound—such as a knife or a bullet—and the manner in which the wound has been inflicted each of these types of wounds carries specific risks associated with surrounding tissue damage and infection types of wound simple laceration this is caused by a clean surface cut from a sharpedged object such as a razor blood vessels are cut straight across so bleeding may be profuse structures such as tendons or nerves may be damaged complex laceration blunt or ripping forces result in tears or lacerations these wounds may bleed less than clean surface cuts but there may be deep tissue damage these lacerations are often contaminated with germs so the risk of infection is high puncture wound an injury such as standing on a nail or being pricked by a needle will result in a puncture wound it has a small entry site but a deep track of internal damage since germs and dirt can be carried far into the body the infection risk with this kind of wound is high abrasion scrape this is a superficial wound in which the topmost layers of skin are scraped off leaving a raw tender area abrasions are often caused by a sliding fall or a friction burn they can contain embedded foreign particles that may cause infection stab wound this is a deep incision caused by a long or bladed instrument usually a knife penetrating the body stab wounds to the trunk must always be treated as serious because of the danger of injury to vital organs and lifethreatening internal bleeding contusion bruise a blunt blow can rupture capillaries beneath the skin causing blood to leak into the tissues this process results in bruising extensive contusion and swelling may indicate deeper damage such as a fracture or an internal injury gunshot wound this type of wound is caused by a bullet or missile being driven into the body causing serious internal injury as well as infection caused by clothing and contaminants from the air being sucked into the wound it is important to note the number of wounds bleeding and types of wounds entry wound exit wound shock this is a lifethreatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails and vital organs such as the heart and brain are deprived of oxygen it requires immediate emergency treatment shock can be made worse by fear and pain minimize the risk of shock developing by reassuring the casualty and making him comfortable the most common cause of shock is severe blood loss if this exceeds pints liters shock will develop this degree of blood loss may result from external bleeding it may also be caused by hidden bleeding from internal organs p blood escaping into a body cavity p or bleeding from damaged blood vessels due to a closed fracture p and p loss of other body fluids can also result in shock conditions that can cause severe fluid loss include diarrhea vomiting bowel obstruction serious burns and blood infection shock may also occur when there is sufficient blood volume but the heart is unable to pump the blood around the body this can be due to severe heart disease heart attack or acute heart failure cardiogenic shock other causes of shock include overwhelming infection septic shock severe allergic reaction anaphylactic shock and spinal cord injury neurogenic shock see also anaphylactic

grit from a wound before beginning treatment if left in a wound they may cause infection or delay healing the best way to remove superficial pieces of glass or grit from the skin is to pick them out with tweezers alternatively rinse loose pieces off with running water do not try to remove pieces that are firmly embedded in the wound because you may damage the surrounding tissue and aggravate bleeding instead cover the object with a dressing and bandage and take the casualty to a healthcare provider blisters infected wound foreign object in a wound never remove impaled objects such as

arrange transportation to the hospital your aims  if at any stage the person loses consciousness and is not breathing normally begin cpr with chest compressions pp the scalp has many small blood vessels running close to the skin surface so any cut can result in profuse bleeding which often makes a scalp wound appear worse than it is in some cases however a scalp wound may form part of a more serious underlying head injury such as a skull fracture or may be associated with a neck injury for these reasons you should examine a casualty with a scalp wound very carefully particularly if it is possible that signs of a serious head injury are being masked by alcohol or drug intoxication if you are in any doubt follow the treatment for head injury p in addition bear in mind the possibility of a neck spinal injury what to do if there are any displaced flaps of skin at the injury site carefully replace them over the wound reassure the casualty keep the pad in place with a roller bandage to

or tissue to mop up any dribbling after ten minutes tell the casualty to release the pressure if the bleeding has not stopped tell him to reapply the pressure for two further periods of ten minutes  nosebleed  to maintain an open airway  to control bleeding your aims bleeding from the nose most commonly occurs when tiny blood vessels inside the nostrils are ruptured either by a blow to the nose or as a result of sneezing picking or blowing the nose nosebleeds may also occur as a result of high blood pressure and anticlotting medication a nosebleed can be serious if the casualty loses a lot of blood in addition if bleeding follows a head injury the blood may appear thin and watery the latter is a very serious sign because it indicates that the skull is fractured and fluid is leaking from around the brain  do not let the casualty tip his head back because blood may then run down the throat and induce vomiting once the bleeding has stopped and with the casualty still leaning forward clean around his nose with lukewarm water advise him to rest quietly for a few hours tell him to avoid exertion and in particular not to blow his nose because this could disturb any clots if bleeding

gently rinse off any dirt before replacing it in the socket if this is not possible ask the casualty to keep the tooth inside his cheek or under his tongue if he feels able to do this without swallowing the tooth alternatively place it in a small container of milk to prevent it from drying out cuts to the tongue lips or lining of the mouth range from minor injuries to more serious wounds the cause is usually the casualty’s own teeth or dental extraction bleeding from the mouth may be profuse and can be alarming in addition there is a danger that blood may be inhaled into the lungs causing problems with breathing what to do what to do ask the casualty to hold the tooth firmly in place send him to a dentist or the hospital gently push the tooth into the socket then press a gauze pad between the bottom and top teeth to help keep the tooth in place if bleeding persists replace the pad tell the casualty to let the blood dribble out; if she swallows it it may induce vomiting do not wash the mouth out because this may disturb a clot advise her to avoid drinking anything hot for hours ask the casualty to sit down with her head forward and tilted slightly to the injured side to allow blood to drain from her mouth place a sterile gauze pad over the wound ask the casualty to squeeze the pad between finger and thumb and press on the wound for ten minutes bleeding from the mouth

girdles or pantyhose because these may cause the bleeding to continue  to control bleeding  to prevent and minimize shock  to arrange urgent removal to the hospital veins contain oneway valves your aims that keep the blood flowing toward the heart if these valves fail blood collects pools behind them and makes the veins swell this problem called varicose veins usually develops in the legs a varicose vein has taut thin walls and is often raised typically producing knobbly skin over the affected area the vein can be burst by a gentle knock and this may result in profuse bleeding shock will quickly develop if bleeding is not controlled keeping the leg raised put another large soft pad over the dressing bandage it firmly enough to exert even pressure but not so tightly that the circulation in the limb is impaired call for emergency help keep the injured leg raised and supported until the ambulance arrives monitor and record vital signs—level of response breathing and pulse pp—regularly until help arrives in addition check the circulation in the limb beyond the bandage p every ten minutes see also shock pp the skeleton is the supporting framework around which the body is constructed it is jointed in many places and muscles attached to the bones enable us to move most of our movements are controlled at will and coordinated by impulses that travel from the brain via the nerves to every muscle and joint in the body it is difficult for a first aider to distinguish between different bone joint and muscle injuries so this chapter begins with an overview of how bones muscles and joints function and how injuries affect them first aid treatments for most injuries from serious fractures to sprains strains and dislocations are included here in this section first aid for head and spinal injuries is also covered in the chapter there is anatomical information about the nervous system that explains how these injuries can be made worse by potential damage to the damage and spinal cord  to assess the casualty’s condition quickly and calmly  to support the injured part of the body  to minimize shock  to call for emergency help if you suspect a serious injury  to comfort and reassure the casualty  to be aware of your own needs aims and objectives bone joint and muscle injuries the skeleton the body is built on a framework of bones called the skeleton this structure supports the muscles blood vessels and nerves of the body many bones of the skeleton also protect important organs such as the brain and heart at many points on the skeleton bones articulate with each other by means of joints these are supported by ligaments and moved by muscles that are attached to the bones by tendons bone joint and muscle injuries the skeleton there are bones in the adult human skeleton providing a protective framework for the body the skull spine and rib cage protect vital body structures; the pelvis supports the abdominal organs; and the bones and joints of the arms and legs enable the body to move breastbone sternum ulna radius upper arm bone humerus collarbone clavicle hip joint is point at which leg bones are connected to pelvis forearm bones thighbone femur kneecap patella splint bone fibula bones of the hand wrist bones carpals hand bone metacarpal finger bone phalanx shinbone tibia lower leg bones ankle bones tarsals foot bones metatarsals shoulder blade scapula twelve pairs of ribs form rib cage which protects vital organs in chest and moves with lungs during breathing spine which is formed from bones separate vertebrae and the fused sacrum and coccyx protects spinal cord and enables back to move skull protects brain and supports structures of face collarbones and shoulder blades form shoulder girdle to which arms are attached jawbone mandible is hinged and enables mouth to open and close pelvis is attached to lower part of spine and protects lower abdominal organs scaphoid also known as the backbone the spine has a number of functions it supports the head makes the upper body flexible helps support the body’s weight and protects the spinal cord p the spine is a column made up of bones called vertebrae which are connected by joints between individual vertebrae are disks of fibrous tissue known as intervertebral disks which help make the spine flexible and cushion it from jolts muscles and ligaments that are attached to the vertebrae help stabilize the spine and control the movements of the back the spine this bony structure protects the brain and the top of the spinal cord it also supports the eyes and other facial structures the skull is made up of several bones most of which are fused at joints called sutures within the bone are air spaces sinuses which lighten the skull the bones covering the brain form a dome called the cranium several other bones form the eye sockets nose cheeks and jaw the skull spinal column the vertebrae form five groups the cervical vertebrae support the head and neck; the thoracic vertebrae form an anchor for the ribs; the lumbar vertebrae help support the body’s weight and give stability; the sacrum supports the pelvis; and the coccyx forms the end of the spine structures that make the spine flexible the joints connecting the vertebrae and the disks between the vertebrae allow the spine to move there is only limited movement between adjacent vertebrae but together the vertebrae disks and ligaments allow a range of movements in the spine as a whole the skeleton structures of the skull this illustration shows the cranium and the main bones of the face the jawbone is the only bone in the skull that moves significantly cervical spine bones thoracic spine bones lumbar spine bones sacrum fused bones suture parietal bone vertebra gelatinous core portion of spine section of disk fibrous covering intervertebral disk frontal bone eye socket nasal bone lower jawbone mandible cheekbone zygomatic bone ligaments between vertebrae help control movement of spine projection provides an anchor for ligaments and muscles coccyx fused bones occipital bone temporal bone upper jawbone maxilla bone joint and muscle injuries bones muscles and joints bone is a living tissue containing calcium and phosphorus—minerals that make it hard rigid and strong from birth to early adulthood bones grow by laying down calcium on the outside they are also able to generate new tissue after injury age and certain diseases can weaken bones making them brittle and susceptible to breaking or crumbling either under stress or spontaneously inherited problems or bone disorders such as rickets cancer and infections can cause bones to become distorted and weakened damage to the bones during adolescence can shorten a bone or impair movement in older people a disorder called osteoporosis can cause the bones to lose density making them brittle and prone to breaking muscles cause various parts of the body to move skeletal voluntary muscles control movement and posture they are attached to bones by bands of strong fibrous tissue tendons and many operate in groups as one group of muscles contracts its paired group relaxes involuntary muscles operate the internal organs such as the heart and work constantly even while we are asleep they are controlled by the autonomic nervous system p the muscles parts of a bone each bone is covered by a membrane periosteum which contains nerves and blood vessels under this membrane is a layer of compact dense bone; at the core is spongy bone in some bones there is a cavity at the center containing soft tissue called bone marrow straightening the arm the triceps muscle at the back of the upper arm shortens contracts to pull down the bones of the forearm the biceps muscle at the front of the arm relaxes bending the arm the biceps muscle at the front of the arm shortens contracts pulling the bones of the forearm upward to bend the arm at the same time the triceps muscle relaxes and lengthens spongy bone compact bone bone marrow vein nerve artery periosteum triceps muscle contracts biceps muscle relaxes tendon triceps muscle relaxes biceps muscle contracts bones muscles and joints the joints a joint is where one bone meets another in a few joints immovable joints the bone edges fit together or are fused immovable joints are found in the skull and pelvis most joints are movable and the bone ends are joined by fibrous tissue called ligaments which form a capsule around the joint the capsule lining synovial membrane produces fluid to lubricate the joint; the ends of the bones are also protected by smooth cartilage muscles that move the joint are attached to the bones by tendons the degree and type of movement depends on the way the ends of the bones fit together the strength of the ligaments and the arrangement of muscles structures of a movable joint cartilage covers the bone ends and minimizes friction bands of tissue ligaments hold the ends together the joint is enclosed in a lubricantfilled capsule pivot joint one bone rotates within a fixed collar formed by another as at the base of the skull saddle joint bone ends meet at right angles in this joint the only example is at the base of the thumb hinge joint this joint allows bending and straightening in only one plane as in the knees and elbows plane joint surfaces of this type of joint are almost flat and slide over each other this joint is found in the wrist and foot ballandsocket joint this joint allows movement in all directions examples are the hip and shoulder ellipsoidal joint in this type of joint movement can occur in most directions the wrist joint is an example bone ligament cartilage synovial membrane synovial fluid bone joint and muscle injuries  to prevent movement at the injury site  to arrange

bone is called a fracture considerable force is needed to break a bone unless it is diseased or old however bones that are still growing are supple and may split bend or crack like a twig a bone may break at the point where a heavy blow is received fractures may also result from a twist or a wrench indirect force in an open fracture one of the broken bone ends may pierce the skin surface or there may be a wound at the fracture site an open fracture carries a high risk of becoming infected in a closed fracture the skin above the fracture is intact however bones may be displaced unstable causing internal bleeding and the casualty may develop shock pp open and closed fractures a stable fracture occurs when the broken bone ends do not move because they are not completely broken or they are impacted such injuries are common at the wrist shoulder ankle and hip usually these fractures can be gently handled without further damage in an unstable fracture the broken bone ends can easily move there is a risk that they may damage blood vessels nerves and organs around the injury unstable injuries can occur if the bone is broken or the ligaments are torn ruptured they should be handled carefully to prevent further damage stable and unstable fractures closed fracture the skin is not broken although the bone ends may damage nearby tissues and blood vessels internal bleeding is a risk open fracture bone is exposed at the surface where it breaks the skin the casualty may suffer bleeding and shock infection is a risk stable fracture although the bone is fractured the ends of the injury remain in place the risk of bleeding or further damage is minimal unstable fracture in this type of fracture the broken bone ends can easily be displaced by movement or muscle contraction

dislocation can be caused by a strong force wrenching the bone into an abnormal position or by violent muscle contraction this very painful injury most often affects the shoulder knee jaw or joints in the thumbs or fingers dislocations may be associated with torn ligaments pp or with damage to the synovial membrane that lines the joint capsule p joint dislocation can have serious consequences if vertebrae are dislocated the spinal cord can be damaged dislocation of the shoulder or hip may damage the large nerves that supply the limbs and result in partial paralysis a dislocation of any joint may also fracture the bones involved it is difficult to distinguish a dislocation from a closed fracture p if you are in any doubt treat the injury as a fracture for extra support for an injured arm secure the limb to the chest by tying a broadfold bandage p around the chest and the sling check the circulation beyond the bandages p every ten minutes immobilize the injured arm with a sling p  caution bone joint and muscle injuries strains and sprains the softer structures around bones and joints—the ligaments muscles and tendons— can be injured in several ways injuries to these soft tissues are commonly called strains and sprains they occur when the tissues are overstretched and partially or completely torn ruptured by violent or sudden movements for this reason strains and sprains are frequently associated with sports strains and sprains should be treated initially by the “rice” procedure r—rest the injured part; i—apply ice pack or a cold pad; c—provide comfortable support with mild compression from an elastic bandage; e—elevate the injured part this procedure may be sufficient to relieve the symptoms but if you are in any doubt treat it as a fracture pp muscles and tendons may be strained ruptured or bruised a strain occurs when the muscle is overstretched; it may be partially torn often at the junction between the muscle and the tendon that joins it to a bone in a rupture a muscle or tendon is torn completely; this may occur in the main bulk of the muscle or in the tendon deep bruising can be extensive in parts of the body where there is a large bulk of muscle injuries in these areas are usually accompanied by bleeding into the surrounding tissues which can lead to pain swelling and bruising muscle and tendon injury muscle tears vigorous movements may cause muscle fibers such as the hamstring in the leg to tear muscle tears can cause severe pain and swelling ruptured tendon the achilles tendon attaches the calf muscle to the heel bone it can snap after sudden exertion and may need surgery and immobilization one common ligament injury is a sprain this is the stretching or tearing of a ligament at or near a joint it is often due to a sudden or unexpected wrenching motion that pulls the bones in the joint too far apart tearing the surrounding tissues ligament injury sprained ankle this is due to overstretching or tearing of one or more ligaments—the fibrous cords that connect bones at a joint in this example one of the ligaments in the ankle is partially torn ruptured achilles tendon normal muscle fibers torn muscle fibers produce localized pain and swelling tibialis anterior tendon tibia fibula sprained ligament heel bone strains and sprains there may be  pain and tenderness  difficulty in moving the injured part especially if it is a joint  swelling and bruising in the area recognition  to reduce swelling and pain  to obtain medical help if necessary your aims see also cold compresses p fractures pp what to do help the casualty sit or lie down support the injured part in a comfortable position preferably raised cool the area by applying a cold compress such as an ice pack in a towel p to the injury this helps reduce swelling bruising and pain  apply comfortable support to the injured part leave the cold compress in place or wrap an elastic bandage around the area secure it with a support bandage that extends to the next joint; for an ankle injury the bandage should extend from the base of the toes to below the knee support the injured part in a raised position to help minimize bruising and swelling in the area check the circulation beyond the bandages p every ten minutes if the circulation is impaired loosen the bandages if the pain is severe or the casualty is unable to use the injured part arrange to take or send him to the hospital otherwise advise the casualty to rest the injury and to seek medical advice if necessary  bone joint and muscle injuries the nervous system the nervous system is the body's informationgathering storage and control system it consists of a central processing unit—the brain—and a network of nerve cells and fibers there are two main parts to the nervous system the central nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system which consists of all the nerves that connect the brain and the spinal cord to the rest of the body in addition the autonomic involuntary nervous system controls body functions such as digestion heart rate and breathing the central nervous system receives and analyzes information from all parts of the body the nerves carry messages in the form of highspeed electrical impulses between the brain and the rest of the nervous system spinal cord protection the spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column nerves from the spinal cord emerge between vertebrae brain structure of the nervous system the system consists of the brain spinal cord and a network of nerves that carry electrical impulses between the brain and the body cross section through a nerve each nerve is made up of bundles of nerve fibers fascicles a fatty substance myelin surrounds and insulates larger nerve fibers cranial nerves pairs extend directly from the underside of the brain; most serve the head face neck and shoulders vagus nerve longest of the cranial nerves serves organs in chest and abdomen; it controls the heart rate radial nerve controls muscles that straighten elbow and fingers tibial nerve serves calf muscles sciatic nerve serves hip and hamstring muscles body of vertebra spinal nerve spinal cord nerve fiber myelin sheath nerve fascicle the nervous system structure of the brain the brain is enclosed within the skull it has three main parts the cerebrum which has an outer layer called the cortex; the cerebellum; and the brain stem central nervous system together the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system cns this system contains billions of interconnected nerve cells neurons and is enclosed by three membranes called meninges a clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid flows around the brain and spinal cord it functions as a shock absorber provides oxygen and nutrients and removes waste products the brain has three main structures the cerebrum which is concerned with thought sensation and conscious movement; the cerebellum which coordinates movement balance and posture; and the brain stem which controls basic functions such as breathing the main function of the spinal cord is to convey signals between the brain and the peripheral nervous system below autonomic nervous system some of the cranial nerves and several small spinal nerves work as the autonomic nervous system this system is concerned with vital body functions such as heart rate and breathing the system’s two parts the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems counterbalance each other the sympathetic system prepares the body for action by releasing hormones that raise the heart rate and reduce the blood flow to the skin and intestines the parasympathetic system releases hormones with a calming effect peripheral nervous system this part of the nervous system consists of two sets of paired nerves—the cranial and spinal nerves—connecting the cns to the body the cranial nerves emerge in pairs from the underside of the brain the pairs of spinal nerves branch off at intervals from the spinal cord passing into the rest of the body nerves comprise bundles of nerve fibers that can relay both incoming sensory and outgoing motor signals spinal cord extends from brain stem to lower end of spine vertebral column protects delicate spinal cord brain stem cerebrum cerebellum skull cerebrospinal fluid meninges membranes surround brain and spinal cord bone joint and muscle injury head injury head injuries are common they are potentially serious because they can lead to damage to the brain there may also be injuries to the spine in the neck scalp wounds andor a skull fracture if a casualty has sustained a minor injury such as a bruise or scalp wound he is likely to be fully conscious if he has suffered a more serious blow to the head such as in a sporting impact consciousness may be temporarily impaired the brain lies inside the skull cushioned by fluid and can therefore be shaken by a blow to the head this is called concussion and it often produces a temporary loss of consciousness complications from concussion may affect thinking language or emotions and may lead to problems with communication and memory and cause personality changes depression and earlyonset dementia if a casualty has suffered a severe blow to his head this may cause bleeding or swelling inside the skull that can press on the brain compression this is a serious condition the pressure can rise immediately after the impact or it may develop a few hours or even days later the severity of the head injury is related to the mechanism of injury and its impact on the head a serious head injury is likely after a high speed motor collision or a fall from a height seek medical advice if you notice signs of a worsening head injury such as  increasing drowsiness  persistent headache  confusion dizziness balance problems andor memory loss  difficulty speaking  difficulty walking  vomiting episodes after the injury  double vision  seizure causes of head injury the brain

situations a blow to one side of the jaw produces indirect force which causes a fracture on the other side of the face a fall onto the point of the chin can fracture the jaw on both sides the lower jaw may also be dislocated by a blow to the face or is sometimes dislocated by yawning if the face is seriously injured with the jaw fractured in more than one place treat as for a facial injury opposite if the casualty is not seriously injured help him sit with his head forward to allow fluids to drain from his mouth encourage the casualty to spit out loose teeth and keep them to send to the

broken by a direct blow usually a fracture results from an indirect force transmitted from an impact at the shoulder or passing along the arm for example from a fall onto an outstretched arm collarbone fractures often occur in young people as a result of sports activities the broken ends of the collarbone may be displaced causing swelling and bleeding in the surrounding tissues as well as distortion of the shoulder what to do help the casualty sit down gently place the injured arm across her body in the position that she finds most comfortable ask her to support the elbow on the

however it is much more common especially in elderly people for the arm bone to break at the shoulder end usually in a fall a fracture at the top of the bone is usually a stable injury p because the broken bone ends stay in place for this reason it may not be immediately apparent that the bone is broken although the arm is likely to be painful there is a possibility that the casualty will cope with the pain and leave the fracture untreated for some time what to do help the casualty sit down remove all jewelry such as bracelets rings and watches gently place the forearm horizontally across

muscles and ligaments or the spinal cord and the nerves that branch off from it the most serious risk associated with spinal injury is damage to the spinal cord such damage can cause loss of power andor sensation below the injured area the spinal cord or nerve roots can suffer temporary damage if they are pinched by displaced or dislocated disks or by fragments of broken bone if the cord is partly or completely severed damage may be permanent the most important indicator is the mechanism of the injury suspect spinal injury if abnormal forces have been exerted on the back or neck and particularly if a casualty complains of any changes in sensation or difficulties with movement if the incident involved violent forward or backward bending or twisting of the spine you must assume that the casualty has a spinal injury you must take particular care to avoid unnecessary movement of the head neck and spine at all times although spinal cord injury may occur without any damage to the vertebrae spinal fracture greatly increases the risk the areas that are most vulnerable are the bones in the neck and those in the lower back any of the following incidents should alert you to a possible spinal injury  falling from a height such as a ladder  falling awkwardly for instance while doing gymnastics or bouncing on a trampoline  diving into a shallow pool and hitting the bottom  falling from a horse or motorcycle  football tackle or misplaced hit  sudden deceleration in a motor vehicle  a heavy object falling across the back  injury to the head or the face when the vertebrae

foot and toe injuries cramps cramps see also dehydration p heat exhaustion p  to relieve the spasm and pain this condition is a sudden painful spasm in one or more muscles your aim cramps commonly occur during sleep they can also develop after strenuous exercise due to a buildup of chemical waste products in the muscles or to excessive loss of salts and fluids from the body through sweating or dehydration cramps can often be relieved by stretching and massaging the affected muscles cramp in the foot help the casualty stand with his weight on the front of his foot; you can also rest the foot on your knee to stretch the affected muscles once the spasm has passed massage the affected part of the foot with your fingers cramp in the calf muscles help the casualty straighten his knee and support his foot flex his foot upward toward his shin to stretch the calf muscles then massage the affected area on the back of the calf cramp in the front of the thigh help the casualty lie down

the skin protects the body and helps maintain body temperature within a normal range it can be damaged by fire hot liquids or caustic substances this chapter contains advice on how to assess burns whether minor or severe the effects of temperature extremes can also impair skin and other body functions injuries may be localized— such as frostbite or sunburn—or generalized as in heat exhaustion or hypothermia young children and the elderly are most susceptible to problems caused by extremes of temperature  to assess the casualty’s condition quickly and calmly  to comfort and reassure the casualty  to call for emergency help if you suspect a serious illness or injury  to be aware of your own needs for burns  to protect yourself and the casualty from danger;  to assess the burn prevent further damage and relieve symptoms for extremes of temperature  to protect the casualty from heat or cold  to restore normal body temperature aims and objectives effects of heat and cold effects of heat and cold the skin one of the largest organs the skin plays key roles in protecting the body from injury and infection and in maintaining the body at a constant temperature the skin consists of two layers of tissue—an outer layer epidermis and an inner layer dermis—that lie on a layer of fatty tissue subcutaneous fat the top part of the epidermis is made up of dead flattened skin cells which are constantly shed and replaced by new cells made in the lower part of this layer the epidermis is protected by an oily substance called sebum— secreted from glands called sebaceous glands— which keeps the skin supple and waterproof the lower layer of the skin the dermis contains the blood vessels nerves muscles sebaceous glands sweat glands and hair roots follicles the ends of sensory nerves within the dermis register sensations from the body’s surface such as heat cold pain and even the slightest touch blood vessels supply the skin with nutrients and help regulate body temperature by preserving or releasing heat opposite structure of the skin the skin is made up of two layers the thin outer epidermis and the thicker dermis beneath it most of the structures of the skin such as blood vessels nerves and hair roots are contained within the dermis hair follicle pore releases sweat at the skin surface erector pili muscle contracts to pull the hair upright hair tiny structures called papillae form the junction between the dermis and epidermis nerve epidermis dermis layer of fatty tissue nerve ending sweat gland secretes sweat onto the skin surface sebaceous gland produces oily secretion sebum arteriole supplies oxygenated blood venule carries away waste the skin one of the major functions of the skin is to help maintain the body temperature within its optimum range of °f °c a structure in the brain called the hypothalamus regulates body temperature if the temperature of blood passing through this thermostat falls or rises to a level outside the optimum range various mechanisms are activated to either warm or cool the body as necessary how the body keeps warm when the body becomes too cold changes take place to prevent heat from escaping blood vessels at the body surface narrow constrict to keep warm blood in the main part core of the body the activity of the sweat glands is reduced and hairs stand on end to “trap” warm air close to the skin in addition to the mechanisms that prevent heat loss other body systems act to produce more warmth the rate of metabolism is increased heat is also generated by muscle activity which may be either voluntary for example during physical exercise or in cold conditions involuntary shivering how the body loses heat in hot conditions the body activates a number of mechanisms to encourage heat loss and thus prevent the body temperature from becoming too high blood vessels that lie in or just under the skin widen dilate as a result blood flow to the body surface increases and more heat is lost in addition the sweat glands become more active and secrete more sweat this sweat then cools the skin as it evaporates maintaining body temperature how skin responds to low body temperature blood vessels narrow constrict to reduce blood flow to the skin the erector pili muscles contract making the hairs stand upright and trap warm air close to the skin how skin responds to high body temperature blood vessels widen dilate making the skin appear flushed and heat is lost sweat glands become active and produce sweat droplets which evaporate and cool the skin constricted blood vessel dilated blood vessel contracted erector pili muscle sweat gland “goose pimple” sweat droplet erect hair hair relaxed erector pili muscle dermis layer of fatty tissue epidermis effects of heat and cold assessing a burn when skin is damaged by burning it can no longer function effectively as a natural barrier against infection in addition body fluid may be lost because tiny blood vessels in the skin leak tissue fluid serum this fluid either collects under the skin to form blisters or leaks through the surface there may be related injuries significant fluid loss and infection may develop later what to assess it is particularly important to consider the circumstances in which the burn has occurred; whether or not the airway is likely to have been affected; and the extent location and depth of the burn there are many possible causes of burns below by establishing the cause of the burn you may be able to identify any other potential problems that could result for example a fire in an enclosed space is likely to have produced poisonous carbon monoxide gas or other toxic fumes may have been released if burning material was involved if the casualty’s airway has been affected he may have difficulty breathing and will need urgent medical attention and admission to the hospital the extent of the burn will also indicate whether or not shock is likely to develop shock is a lifethreatening condition and occurs whenever there is a serious loss of body fluids p in a burn that covers a large area of the body fluid loss will be significant and the risk of shock high if the burn is on a limb fluid may collect in the tissues around it causing swelling and pain this buildup of fluid is particularly serious if the limb is constricted for example by clothing or footwear burns allow germs to enter the skin and therefore carry a serious risk of infection  flames  contact with hot objects such as domestic appliances or cigarettes dry burn type of burn causes scald electrical burn radiation burn chemical burn cold injury  steam  hot liquids such as tea and coffee or hot oil  lowvoltage current as used by domestic appliances  highvoltage currents as carried in overhead or underground cables  lightning strikes  sunburn  overexposure to ultraviolet rays from a sunlamp  exposure to a radioactive source such as an xray  industrial chemicals including inhaled fumes and corrosive gases  domestic chemicals and agents such as paint stripper caustic soda weed killers bleach oven cleaner or any other strong acid or alkali chemical  frostbite  contact with freezing metals  contact with freezing vapors such as liquid oxygen or liquid nitrogen types of burn and possible causes assessing a burn burns are classified according to the depth of skin damage there are three depths superficial partialthickness and fullthickness a casualty may suffer one or more depths of burn in a single incident a superficial burn involves only the outermost layer of skin the epidermis it usually heals well if first aid is given promptly and if blisters do not form sunburn is one of the most common types of superficial burn other causes include minor domestic incidents partialthickness burns are very painful they destroy the epidermis and cause the skin to become red and blistered they usually heal well but if they affect more than percent of the body in an adult and percent in a child they can be lifethreatening in fullthickness burns pain sensation is lost which masks the severity of the injury the skin may look waxy pale or charred and needs urgent medical attention there are likely to be areas of partial and superficial burns around them depth of burns if the casualty is a child seek medical advice or take the child to the hospital however small the burn appears for adults medical attention should be sought for any serious burn such burns include  all partialthickness burns larger than percent of the total body surface area  all burns involving the face hands feet genitals and genital area or major joints  all fullthickness burns  electrical burns including lightning injury  chemical burns  inhalation injury  casualties with preexisting medical disorders that could complicate treatment  casualties with trauma as well as burns  casualties who will require social emotional or rehabilitative treatment if you are unsure about the severity of any burn seek medical advice burns that require hospital treatment superficial burn this type of burn involves only the outermost layer of skin superficial burns are characterized by redness swelling and tenderness partialthickness burn this affects the epidermis and the skin becomes red and raw blisters form over the skin due to fluid released from the damaged tissues beneath fullthickness burn with this type of burn all the layers of the skin are affected; there may be some damage to nerves fat tissue muscles and blood vessels burn tissue fluid blister damaged tissues effects of heat and cold severe burns

 to gather information for the emergency services recognition your aims  do not remove anything sticking to the burn; you may cause further damage and introduce infection into the burned area  do not burst any blisters  do not apply any lotion or ointment to the burned area; it may damage tissues and increase the risk of infection  the use of specialized dressings sprays and gels to cool burns is not recommended  do not use adhesive dressings or apply adhesive tape to the skin; a burn may be more extensive than it first appears  if the casualty has a burn on his face do not cover the injury— you could cause the casualty distress and obstruct the airway  do not allow the casualty to eat or drink because he may need an anesthetic take great care when treating thermal burns that are deep or extensive the longer the burning continues the more severe the injury will be if the casualty has been injured in a fire assume that smoke or hot air has also affected his airway andor lungs your priorities are to cool the burn which stops the burning process and relieves the pain and to monitor his breathing a casualty with a severe burn or scald injury will almost certainly be suffering from shock because of the fluid loss and will need urgent hospital treatment the possibility of nonaccidental injury must always be considered no matter what the age of the casualty keep an accurate record of what has happened and any treatment you have given if you have to remove or cut away clothing keep it in case of future investigation what to do start cooling the burn as soon as possible after the injury occurred flood the burn with plenty of cool tap water but do not delay removal of the casualty to the hospital help the casualty sit or lie down if possible try to prevent the burned area from coming into contact with the ground call for emergency help; if possible get someone to do this while you cool the burn  caution severe burns and scalds continue cooling the affected area for at least ten minutes or until the pain is relieved watch for signs of breathing difficulty do not overcool the casualty because you may lower the body temperature to a dangerous level this is a particular hazard for babies and elderly people do not touch or otherwise interfere with the burn gently remove rings watches belts shoes and burned or or smoldering clothing before the tissues begin to swell a helper can do this while you are cooling the burn do not remove clothing that is stuck to the burn when the burn is cooled cover the injured area with plastic wrap to protect it from infection discard the first two turns from the roll and then wrap it lengthwise over the burn a clean plastic bag can be used to cover a hand or foot; secure it with a bandage or adhesive tape applied over the plastic not the damaged skin if there is no plastic wrap available use a sterile nonstick dressing or improvise with gauze apply any dressing very loosely reassure the casualty and treat him for shock pp if necessary record details of the casualty’s injuries monitor and record his vital signs—level of response breathing and pulse pp—while waiting for emergency help to arrive effects of heat and cold minor burns and scalds  reddened skin  pain in the area of the burn later there may be  blistering of the affected skin  to stop the burning  to relieve pain and swelling  to minimize the risk of infection recognition your aims small superficial burns and scalds are often due to domestic incidents such as touching a hot iron or oven rack most minor burns can be treated successfully by first aid and will heal naturally however you should advise the casualty to seek medical advice if you are at all concerned about the severity of the injury assessing a burn pp after a burn blisters may form these thin “bubbles” are caused by tissue fluid leaking into the burned area just beneath the skin’s surface you should never break a blister caused by a burn because you may introduce infection into the wound what to do flood the injured part with cold water for at least ten minutes or until the pain is relieved if water is not available any cold harmless liquid such as milk can be used take or send the casualty to the hospital if the casualty is a child or if you are in any doubt about the casualty’s condition gently remove any jewelry watches belts or constricting clothing from the injured area before it begins to swell when the burn is cooled cover it with plastic wrap or place a clean plastic bag over a foot or hand apply the wrap lengthwise over the burn not around the limb because the tissues swell if you do not have plastic wrap or a plastic bag use a sterile dressing or a gauze pad bandaged loosely in place  do not break blisters or otherwise interfere with the

fatal damage most strong corrosive chemicals are found in industry but chemical burns can also occur in the home; for instance from dishwasher products the most common cause of alkali burns in children oven cleaners pesticides and paint stripper chemical burns are always serious and the casualty will need urgent hospital treatment if possible note the name or brand of the burning substance before treating the casualty ensure the safety of yourself and others because some chemicals give off poisonous fumes causing breathing difficulties caution effects of heat and cold chemical burn to the eye splashes of chemicals in the eye can cause serious injury if not treated quickly some chemicals damage the surface of the eye resulting in scarring and even blindness your priority is to wash out irrigate the eye so that the chemical is diluted and dispersed when irrigating the eye be careful that the contaminated rinsing water does not splash you or the casualty before beginning to treat the casualty put on protective gloves if available what to do put on protective gloves hold the casualty’s affected eye under gently running cold water for at least ten minutes irrigate the eyelid thoroughly both inside and out; if the casualty’s eye is shut in a spasm of pain gently but firmly try to pull the eyelid open arrange to take or send the casualty to the hospital identify the chemical if possible and pass on details to the medical staff make sure that contaminated water does not splash the uninjured eye you may find it easier to pour the water over the eye using an eye

two to six percent of his body weight can occur during a typical period of exercise on a warm day the average daily intake of fluids is pints liters; this fluid loss needs to be replaced in addition to fluid the body loses essential body salts through sweating dehydration is primarily the result of excessive sweating during sporting activities especially in hot weather; prolonged exposure to sun or hot humid conditions; sweating through raised body temperature during a fever; and loss of fluid through severe diarrhea and vomiting young children older people or those involved in prolonged periods of activity are particularly at risk severe dehydration can cause muscle cramps through the loss of body salts the aim of first aid is to replace the lost water and salts through rehydration

than others to developing heat exhaustion a dangerous and common cause of heat exhaustion occurs when the body produces more heat than it can cope with some nonprescription drugs such as ecstasy can affect the body’s temperature regulation system this combined with the exertion of dancing in a warm environment can result in a person becoming overheated and dehydrated these effects can lead to

foreign objects poisoning bites and stings the sensory organs the body is covered and protected by the skin this is one of the body’s largest organs and is made up of two layers the outer layer called the epidermis and an inner layer the dermis the skin forms a barrier against harmful substances and germs it is also an important sense organ containing nerves that ensure that the body is sensitive to heat cold pain and touch these complex organs enable us to see the world around us each eye consists of a colored part iris with a small opening pupil that allows light to enter the eye the size of the pupil changes according to the amount of light that is entering the eye light is focused by the transparent lens onto a “screen” retina at the back of the eye special cells in the retina convert this information into electrical impulses that then travel via the optic nerve that leads from the eye to the part of the brain where the impulses are analyzed each eye is protected by a bony socket

poisoning bites and stings how poisons affect the body a poison toxin is a substance that if taken into or absorbed into the body in sufficient quantity can cause either temporary or permanent damage poisons can be swallowed absorbed through the skin inhaled splashed into the eyes or injected once in the body they may enter the bloodstream and be carried swiftly to all organs and tissues signs and symptoms of poisoning vary with the poison they may develop quickly or over a number of days vomiting is common especially when the poison has been ingested inhaled poisons often cause breathing difficulties effects of poisons on the body poisons can enter the body through the skin digestive system lungs or bloodstream once there they can be carried to all parts of the body and cause multiple side effects poisons reaching the brain may cause confusion delirium seizures and unconsciousness swallowed corrosive chemicals can burn the mouth lips and food passage esophagus some poisons disturb the action of the heart by interrupting its normal electrical activity poisons reaching the kidneys situated toward the back of the body behind the large intestine from the bloodstream can cause serious damage to these organs injected poisons and drugs rapidly enter the bloodstream; some prevent blood cells from carrying oxygen to body tissues corrosive chemicals can burn the skin pesticides and plant toxins may be absorbed through the skin causing local or general reactions poisons in the digestive system can cause vomiting abdominal pain and diarrhea poisons can seriously damage the liver poisonous gases solvents vapors or fumes can be inhaled and affect the airways and lungs causing severe breathing problems how poisons affect the body types of poisons types of poisons some poisons are manmade—for example chemicals and drugs—and these are found in the home as well as in industry almost every household contains substances that are potentially poisonous such as bleach and paint stripper as well as prescribed or overthecounter medicines which may be dangerous if taken in excessive amounts other poisons occur in nature for example plants produce poisons that may irritate

which the body fails to produce sufficient insulin insulin is a chemical produced by the pancreas a gland that lies behind the stomach which regulates the blood sugar glucose level in the body diabetes can result in higher than normal blood sugar hyperglycemia or lower than normal blood sugar hypoglycemia if a person with diabetes is unwell giving him sugar will rapidly correct hypoglycemia and is unlikely to do harm in cases of hyperglycemia types of diabetes there are two types type or insulindependent diabetes and type also known as noninsulindpendent diabetes in type diabetes the body produces little or no insulin people with type diabetes need regular insulin injections throughout their lives type diabetes is sometimes referred to as juvenile diabetes or earlyonset diabetes because it usually develops in childhood or the teenage years insulin can be administered using an insulin syringe an injection pen or a special pump the pump is a small device about the size of a pack of cards strapped to the person’s body the insulin is administered via a piece of tubing that leads from the pump to a needle just under the skin in type diabetes the body does not make enough insulin or cannot use it properly this type is usually linked with obesity and is also known as maturityonset diabetes because it is more common in people over the age of the risk of developing this type is increased if it runs in your family type diabetes can sometimes be controlled with diet weight loss and regular exercise however oral medication and in some cases insulin injections may be needed what to do diabetes mellitus high blood sugar hyperglycemia may develop slowly over a period of hours or days if it is not treated hyperglycemia will result in unconsciousness diabetic coma and

include head injury some braindamaging diseases shortage of oxygen or glucose in the brain and the intake of certain poisons including alcohol or drugs epileptic seizures result from recurrent major disturbances of brain activity these seizures can be sudden and dramatic just before a seizure a casualty may have a brief warning period aura with for example a strange feeling or a particular smell

fainting is a brief loss of consciousness caused by a temporary reduction of the blood flow to the brain it may be a reaction to pain exhaustion lack of food or emotional stress it is also common after long periods of physical inactivity such as standing or sitting still especially in a warm atmosphere this inactivity causes blood to pool in the legs reducing the amount of blood reaching the brain when a person faints the pulse rate becomes very slow however the rate soon picks up and returns to normal a casualty who has fainted usually makes a rapid and complete recovery do not advise a person who feels faint to sit on a chair with his head between his knees because if he faints he may fall and injure himself if the casualty is a woman in the late stages of pregnancy help her lie

difficulty breathing ranging from a tight chest to severe difficulty causing the casualty to wheeze and gasp for air  pale or flushed skin  visible swelling of tongue and throat with puffiness around the eyes  feeling of terror  confusion and agitation  signs of shock leading to collapse and loss of consciousness recognition this is a severe allergic reaction affecting the whole body it may develop within seconds or minutes of contact with a trigger and is potentially fatal in an anaphylactic reaction chemicals are released into the blood that widen dilate blood vessels this causes blood pressure to fall and air passages to narrow constrict resulting in breathing difficulties in addition the tongue and throat can swell obstructing the airway the amount of oxygen reaching the vital organs can be severely reduced causing hypoxia p common triggers include nuts shellfish eggs wasp and bee stings latex and certain medications a casualty with anaphylactic shock needs emergency

medical or dental advice if necessary your aims earache can result from inflammation of the outer middle or inner ear often caused by an infection associated with a cold tonsillitis or flu it can also be caused by a boil an object stuck in the ear canal or transmitted pain from a tooth abscess there may also be temporary hearing loss earache often occurs when flying as a result of the changes in air pressure during ascent and descent infection can cause pus to collect in the middle ear; the eardrum may rupture allowing the pus to drain which temporarily eases the pain toothache can develop when pulp inside a tooth becomes inflamed due to dental decay if untreated the pulp becomes infected leading to an abscess which causes a throbbing pain infection may cause swelling around the tooth or jaw  do not give aspirin to anyone under years of age  if there is a discharge from an ear fever or hearing loss obtain medical help advise a casualty to seek medical advice if you are concerned particularly if the casualty is a child if a casualty has toothache advise her to see her dentist the most common sore throat is a “raw” feeling caused by inflammation which is often the first sign of a cough or cold tonsillitis occurs when the tonsils at the back of the throat are infected the tonsils become red and swollen and white spots of pus may be seen swallowing may be difficult and the glands at the angle of the jaw may be enlarged and sore  to relieve the pain  to obtain medical advice if necessary your aims  do not give aspirin to anyone under years of age  if you suspect

to obtain medical help if necessary your aims pain in the abdomen often has a relatively minor cause such as food poisoning the pain of a stitch usually occurs during exercise and is sharp distension widening or obstruction of the intestine causes colic—pain that comes and goes in waves— which often makes the casualty double up in agony and may be accompanied by vomiting occasionally abdominal pain is a sign of a serious disorder affecting the organs and other structures in the abdomen if the appendix bursts or the intestine is damaged the contents of the intestine can leak into the abdominal cavity causing inflammation of the cavity lining this lifethreatening condition called peritonitis causes intense pain which is made worse by movement or pressure on the abdomen and will lead to shock pp an inflamed appendix appendicitis is especially common in children symptoms include pain often starting in the center of the abdomen and moving to the lower righthand side loss of appetite nausea vomiting bad breath and fever if the appendix bursts peritonitis will develop the treatment is urgent surgical removal of the appendix abdominal pain  if the pain is severe or occurs with fever and vomiting call for emergency help treat the casualty for shock pp do not give her medicine or allow her to eat or drink because an anesthetic may be needed what to do reassure the casualty and make her comfortable prop her up if she finds breathing difficult give her a container to use if she is vomiting give the casualty a hotwater bottle wrapped in a towel to hold against her abdomen if in doubt about her condition seek medical advice  see also shock pp this common condition is a form of cramp usually associated with exercise which occurs in the trunk or the sides of the chest the most likely cause is a buildup in the muscles of chemical waste products such as lactic acid during physical exertion help the casualty sit down and reassure him the pain will usually ease quickly if the pain does not disappear within a few minutes or if you are concerned about the casualty’s condition seek medical advice caution special case stitch abdominal pain vomiting and diarrhea vomiting and diarrhea see also drug poisoning p swallowed poisons p what to do reassure the casualty if she is vomiting and give her a warm damp cloth to wipe her face help her sit down and when the vomiting stops give her water or unsweetened fruit juice to sip slowly and often when the casualty is hungry again advise her to eat easily digested foods such as pasta bread or potatoes for the first hours there may be  nausea  vomiting and later diarrhea  stomach pains  fever recognition these problems are usually due to irritation of the digestive system diarrhea and vomiting can be caused by a number of different organisms including viruses bacteria and parasites they usually result from consuming contaminated food or water but infection can be passed from person to person good hygiene helps prevent infectious diarrhea vomiting and diarrhea may occur either separately or together both conditions can cause the body to lose vital fluids and salts resulting in dehydration when they occur together the risk of dehydration is increased and can be serious especially in infants young children and elderly people the aim of treatment is to prevent dehydration by giving frequent sips of water or unsweetened fruit juice even if the casualty is vomiting dehydration products whether added to water or sold in liquid form provide the correct balance of water and salt to replace those lost through the vomiting and diarrhea and can be purchased at a pharmacy  do not give antidiarrhea medicines  if you are concerned about a casualty’s condition especially if the vomiting or diarrhea is persistent or the casualty is a young child or an older person seek medical advice  to reassure the casualty  to restore lost fluids and salts your aims caution if the vomiting andor diarrhea are severe or the casualty develops chest pain difficulty breathing or severe abdominal pain take or arrange to send her to the hospital if the casualty becomes lightheaded or dizzy treat for fainting p medical conditions  to obtain medical help or arrange for the woman to be taken to the hospital  to ensure privacy reassure the woman and make her comfortable  to prevent infection in the mother baby and yourself  to care for the baby during and after delivery your aims childbirth is a natural and often lengthy process that normally occurs at about the th week of pregnancy there is usually plenty of time to get a woman to the hospital or get help to her before the baby arrives most pregnant women are aware of what happens during childbirth but a woman who goes into labor unexpectedly or early may be very anxious you will need to reassure her and make her comfortable miscarriage however is potentially serious because there is a risk of severe bleeding a woman who is miscarrying needs urgent medical help p there are three distinct stages to childbirth in the first stage the baby gets into position for the birth the baby is born in the second stage and in the third stage the afterbirth placenta and umbilical cord is delivered first stage in this stage a woman’s body begins to experience contractions which together with the pressure of the baby’s head cause the cervix neck of the uteruswomb to open the contractions become stronger and more frequent until the cervix is fully dilated open—about  in  cm—and ready for the baby to be born during this first stage the mucous plug that protects the uterus from infection is expelled and the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby leaks out from the vagina this stage can take several hours for a first baby but is normally shorter in any subsequent pregnancies second stage once the cervix is fully dilated the baby’s head will press down on the mother’s pelvic floor triggering a strong urge to push the birth canal vagina stretches as the baby travels through it the baby’s head normally emerges first and the body is delivered soon afterward this stage of labor normally lasts about an hour third stage about  minutes after the baby is born the placenta the organ that nourishes the unborn baby and the umbilical cord will be expelled from the uterus the uterus begins to contract again pushing the placenta out then it closes down the area where it was attached; this reduces the bleeding childbirth placenta detaches from wall of uterus baby’s head presses against cervix baby emerges uterus contracts to push baby down birth canal fully dilated umbilical cord see also shock pp vaginal bleeding p childbirth emergency childbirth emergency childbirth  do not give the mother anything to eat because there is a risk that she may vomit if she is thirsty give her sips of water  do not pull on the baby’s head or shoulders during delivery  if the umbilical cord is wrapped around the baby’s neck as he is born check that it is loose and then very carefully ease it over the baby’s head to prevent strangulation  if a newborn baby does not cry open the airway and check breathing unconscious infant pp  do not slap the baby  do not pull or cut the umbilical cord even when the placenta has been delivered what to do call for emergency help give the dispatcher details of the stage the mother has reached the length of each contraction and the intervals between them follow the instructions of the dispatcher as the baby is born handle him carefully— newborns are very slippery make sure he is breathing wrap him in a clean cloth towel or blanket and place him between his mother’s legs so he is on the same level as the afterbirth as the third stage begins reassure the mother support her as she delivers the afterbirth; do not cut the cord keep the placenta and the umbilical cord intact because the doctor or ambulance crew need to check that it is complete if bleeding or pain is severe treat for shock pp help the mother lie down and raise her legs when the second stage starts the mother will want to push make sure the surroundings are as clean as possible to reduce the risk of infection the mother should remove any items of clothing that could interfere with the birth put clean sheets or towels under the woman; she may also want to be covered encourage her to stay as upright as possible during the first stage help her sit or kneel on the floor in a comfortable position support her with cushions or let her move around stay calm and encourage her to breathe deeply during her contractions massage her lower back gently using the heel of your hand she may find having her face and hands wiped soothing or you can spray her face with cool water and give her ice cubes to suck  in the rare event of a baby arriving quickly you should not try to “deliver” the baby; the birth will happen naturally without intervention your role is to comfort and listen to the wishes of the mother and care for her and her baby caution see also shock pp vaginal bleeding p this chapter outlines the techniques and procedures that underpin first aid including moving a casualty and applying dressings and bandages usually a first aider is not expected to move an injured person but in some circumstances—such as when a casualty is in immediate danger—it may be necessary the key principles for moving casualties are described here information is also given on making an assessment of the risks involved in moving a casualty or assisting a casualty to safety a guide to the equipment and materials commonly found in a first aid kit is given with information on how and when to use them applying dressings and bandages effectively is an essential part of first aid wounds usually require a dressing and almost all injuries benefit from the support that bandages can give  to assess the casualty’s condition  to comfort and reassure the casualty  to maintain a casualty’s privacy and dignity  to use a first aid technique relevant to the injury  to use dressings and bandages as needed  to apply good handling techniques if moving a casualty  to obtain appropriate help call for emergency help if you suspect serious injury or illness aims and objectives techniques and equipment techniques and equipment removing clothing to make a thorough examination of a casualty obtain an accurate diagnosis or give treatment you may have to remove some of his clothing this should be done with the minimum of disturbance to the casualty and with his agreement if possible remove as little clothing as possible and do not damage clothing unless it is necessary if you need to cut a garment try to cut along the seams keeping the clothing clear of the casualty’s injury maintain the casualty’s privacy and prevent exposure to cold stop if removing clothing increases the casualty’s discomfort or pain removing clothing in lower body injuries removing clothing in upper body injuries shoes untie any laces support the ankle and carefully pull the shoe off by the heel to remove long boots you may need to cut them down the back seam socks remove socks by pulling them off gently if this is not possible lift each sock away from the leg and cut the fabric with a pair of scissors trousers gently pull up the pant leg to expose the calf and knee or pull down from the waist if you need to cut clothing lift it clear of the casualty’s injury jackets support the injured arm undo any fastenings on the jacket and gently pull the garment off the casualty’s shoulders remove the arm on the uninjured side from its sleeve pull the garment around to the injured side of the body and ease it off the injured arm sweaters and sweatshirts with clothing that cannot be unfastened begin by easing the arm on the uninjured side out of its sleeve next roll up the garment and stretch it over the casualty’s head finally slip off the other sleeve of the garment taking care not to disturb her arm on the injured side removing clothing removing headgear protective headgear such as a a horseback rider's bicyclist’s or motorcyclist’s helmet is best left on; it should be removed only if absolutely necessary for example if you cannot maintain an open airway if the item does need to be removed the casualty should do this herself if possible; otherwise you and a helper should remove it support the head and neck at all times and keep the head aligned with the spine see also spinal injury pp ask a helper to grip the sides of the helmet and pull them apart to take pressure off the head then lift the helmet upward and backward undo or cut the straps working from the base of the helmet ease your fingers underneath the rim support the back of the neck with one hand and hold the lower jaw firmly ask a helper to hold the helmet with both hands maintain support on the head and neck ask your helper to tilt the helmet forward slightly so that it will pass over the base of the casualty’s skull and then to lift it straight off the casualty’s head continue to support the casualty’s neck and lower jaw ask your helper working from above to tilt the helmet backward without moving the head and gently lift the front of the helmet clear of the casualty’s chin do not remove a helmet unless absolutely necessary removing an openface or riding helmet removing a fullface helmet undo or cut through the chinstrap support the casualty’s head and neck keeping them aligned with the spine hold the lower jaw with one hand and support the neck with the other hand removing headgear caution casualty handling  do not approach a casualty if doing so puts your own life in danger  do not move a casualty unless there is an emergency situation that demands you take immediate action when giving first aid you should leave a casualty in the position in which you find him until medical help arrives only move him if he is in imminent danger and even then only if it is safe for you to approach and you have the training and equipment to carry out the move a casualty should be moved quickly if he is in imminent danger from  drowning p;  fire or he is in an area that is filling with smoke pp;  explosion or gunfire;  a collapsing building or other structure if it is necessary to move a casualty consider the following before you start  is the task necessary? usually the casualty can be assessed and treated in the position in which you find him  what are his injuries or conditions and will a move make them worse?  can the casualty move himself? ask the casualty if he feels able to move  the weight and size of the casualty  can anyone help? if so are you and any helpers trained and physically fit?  will you need protective equipment to enter the area and do you have it?  is there any equipment available to assist with moving the casualty and are you trained to use it?  is there enough space around the casualty to move him safely?  what sort of ground will you be crossing? if you need to move a casualty take the following steps to ensure safety  select a method relevant to the situation the casualty’s condition and the help and equipment that is available  use a team appoint one person to coordinate the move and make sure that the team understands exactly what to do  plan your move carefully and make sure that everyone is prepared  prepare any equipment and make sure that the team and equipment are in position  use the correct technique to avoid injuring the casualty yourself or any helpers  ensure the safety and comfort of the casualty yourself and any helpers  always explain to the casualty what is happening and encourage him to cooperate as much as possible  position yourself as close as possible to the casualty’s body  adopt a stable base with your feet shoulderwidth apart so that you remain well balanced and maintain good posture at all times during the procedure  use the strongest muscles in your legs and arms to power the move bend your knees assessing the risk of moving a casualty assisting a casualty safely techniques and equipment caution first aid materials all workplaces leisure centers homes and cars should have first aid kits the kits for workplaces or public places must conform to legal requirements and be clearly marked and easily accessible for home or the car you can either buy a kit or put together first aid items yourself and keep them in a

use a prepacked sterile wound dressing with a bandage attached opposite whenever possible if no such dressing is available use a sterile pad alternatively any clean nonfluffy material can be used to improvize a dressing p protect small cuts with an adhesive dressing p when handling or applying a dressing there are a number of rules to follow these enable you to apply dressings correctly; they also protect the casualty and yourself from cross infection  always put on disposable gloves if they are available before handling any dressing  cover the wound with a dressing that extends beyond the wound’s edges  hold the edge of the dressing keeping your fingers well away from the area that will be in contact with the wound  place the dressing directly on top of the wound; do not slide it on from the side  remove and replace any dressing that slips out of position  if you only have one sterile dressing use this to cover the wound and put other clean materials on top of it  if blood seeps through the dressing do not remove it; instead place another dressing over the top if blood seeps through the second dressing remove both dressings completely and then apply a fresh dressing making sure that you put pressure on the bleeding point  after treating a wound dispose of gloves used dressings and soiled items in a suitable plastic bag such as a red biohazard bag keep disposable gloves

sterile dressings are available individually wrapped in various sizes they are sealed in protective wrappings to keep them sterile once the seal on this type of dressing has been broken the dressing is no longer sterile » caution techniques and equipment dressings if there is no sterile wound dressing with a bandage available use a sterile pad or make a pad with pieces of gauze make sure the pad is large enough to extend well beyond the edges of the wound hold the dressing face down; never touch the part of the dressing that will be in contact with a wound secure the dressing with tape if you need to maintain pressure to control bleeding use a bandage if you have no suitable dressings any clean nonfluffy material can be used in an emergency if using a piece of folded cloth hold it by its edges unfold it then refold it so that the clean inner side can be placed against the wound improvised dressings sterile pad and gauze dressings what to do what to do  never apply adhesive tape all the way around a limb or digit because this can impair circulation  check that the casualty is not allergic to the adhesive before using adhesive tape; if there is any allergy use a pad and bandage secure the pad with a bandage or a clean strip of cloth such as a scarf tie the ends in a square knot p place the cloth pad directly on the wound if necessary cover the pad with more material secure the pad with adhesive tape or a roller bandage hold the material by the edges open it out and refold it so that the inner surface faces outward holding the dressing or pad by the edges place it directly onto the wound « caution see also roller bandages pp dressings cold compresses these are useful for dressing small cuts and scrapes they consist of a gauze or cellulose pad and an adhesive backing and are often wrapped singly in sterile packs there are several sizes available and special shapes for use on fingertips heels and elbows; some types are waterproof blister bandages have an oval cushioned pad people who work with food must cover any wounds with waterproof adhesive bandages cooling an injury such as a bruise or sprain can reduce swelling and pain there are two types of compress cold pads which are made from material dampened with cold water and ice packs an ice pack can be made using crushed ice and a small amount of water sealed in a plastic bag or packages of frozen peas or other small vegetables adhesive bandages what to do clean and dry the skin around the wound unwrap the adhesive bandage and hold it by the protective strips over the backing with the pad side facing downward peel back the strips to expose the pad but do not remove them without touching the pad surface place the pad on the wound soak a clean washcloth or towel in cold water wring

away the protective strips then press down the edges of the bandage resoak the pad in cold water every few minutes to keep it cold cool the injury for at least ten minutes hold the pack firmly on the area left cool the injury for no more than ten minutes at a time removing the pack for fiveminute periods    check that the casualty is not allergic to the adhesive dressings if he is use hypoallergenic tape or a pad and bandage  to prevent cold injuries always wrap an ice pack in a cloth do not leave it on the skin for more than ten minutes at a time cold pad ice pack using a cold compress cold compresses caution caution techniques and equipment principles of bandaging there are a number of different first aid uses for bandages they can be used to secure dressings control bleeding support and immobilize limbs and reduce swelling in an injured limb there are three main types of bandages roller bandages secure dressings and support injured limbs tubular bandages hold dressings on fingers or toes or support injured joints triangular bandages can be used as large dressings as slings to secure dressings or to immobilize limbs if you have no bandage available you can improvise from everyday items; for example you can fold a square of fabric such as a headscarf diagonally to make a triangular bandage p  reassure the casualty before applying a bandage and explain clearly what you are going to do  help the casualty sit or lie down in a comfortable position  support the injured part of the body while you are working on it ask the casualty or a helper to do this  work from the front of the casualty and from the injured side where possible  pass the bandages through the body’s natural hollows at the ankles knees waist and neck then slide them into position by easing them back and forth under the body  apply bandages firmly but not so tightly that they interfere with circulation to the area beyond the bandage opposite  fingers or toes should be left exposed if possible so that you can check the circulation afterward  use square knots to tie bandages p ensure that the knots do not cause discomfort and do not tie the knot over a bony area tuck loose ends under a knot if possible to provide additional padding  check the circulation in the area beyond the bandage opposite every ten minutes once it is secured if necessary unroll the bandage until the blood supply returns and reapply it more loosely rules for applying a bandage see also roller bandages pp triangular bandages p tubular gauze bandages p principles of bandaging if circulation is impaired there may be  a swollen and congested limb  blue skin with prominent veins  a feeling that the skin is painfully distended later there may be  pale waxy skin  skin cold to touch  numbness and tingling followed by severe pain  inability to move affected fingers or toes recognition when applying bandages to immobilize a limb you also need to use soft bulky material such as towels or clothing as padding place the padding between the legs or between an arm and the body so that the bandaging does not displace broken bones or press bony areas against each other use folded triangular bandages and tie them at intervals along the limb avoiding the injury site secure with square knots p tied on the uninjured side if both sides of the body are injured tie knots in the middle or where there is least chance of causing further damage when bandaging a limb or applying a sling you must check the circulation in the hand or foot immediately after you have finished bandaging and every ten minutes thereafter these checks are essential because limbs can swell after an injury and a bandage can rapidly become too tight and restrict blood circulation to the area beyond it if this occurs you need to undo the bandage and reapply it more loosely immobilizing a limb checking circulation after bandaging tie knots on the uninjured side never over joint or fracture press one of the nails or the skin beyond the bandage for five seconds until it turns pale then release the pressure if the color does not return within two seconds the bandage is too tight loosen a tight bandage by unrolling enough turns for warmth and color to return to the skin the casualty may feel a tingling sensation if necessary loosen and reapply the bandage recheck every ten minutes  what to do techniques and equipment roller bandages these bandages are made of cotton gauze elastic fabric or linen and are wrapped around the injured part of the body in spiral turns there are three main types of roller bandage  openweave bandages often made of gauze are used to hold dressings in place their loose weave allows good ventilation but they cannot be used to exert direct pressure on the wound to control bleeding or to provide support to joints  selfadhesive support bandages are used to support muscle and joint injuries and do not need pins or clips  elastic bandages are used to give firm even support to injured joints there are several ways to fasten the end of a roller bandage safety pins or adhesive tape are usually included in first aid kits some bandage packs may contain bandage clips if you do not have any of these a simple tuck should keep the bandage end in place before applying a roller bandage check that it is tightly rolled and of a suitable width for the injured area small areas such as fingers require narrow bandages of approximately in cm wide while wider bandages of  in  cm are more suitable for large areas such as legs it is better for a roller bandage to be too wide than too narrow smaller sizes may be needed for a child securing roller bandages choosing the correct size of bandage adhesive tape the ends of bandages can be folded under and then stuck down with small strips of adhesive tape safety pin these pins can secure all types of roller bandage fold the end of the bandage under then put your finger under the bandage to prevent injury as you insert the pin right make sure that once fastened the pin lies flat far right bandage clip metal clips are sometimes supplied with elastic roller bandages for securing the ends tucking in the end if you have no fastening secure the bandage by passing the end around the limb once and tucking it in roller bandages follow the general rules below when applying a roller bandage to an injury  keep the rolled part of the bandage the “head” uppermost as you work the unrolled short end is called the “tail”  position yourself in front of the casualty on the injured side  support the injured part while you apply the bandage applying a roller bandage what to do place the tail of the bandage below the injury working from the inside of the limb outward make two straight turns with the bandage to anchor the tail

continue to bandage diagonally above and below the joint in a figureeight increase the bandaged area by covering about twothirds of the previous turn with each new layer pass the bandage from the inner side of the upper limb to just below the joint make one diagonal turn below the elbow joint to cover the lower half of the bandaging from the first straight turn   do not apply the bandage so tightly that the circulation to the limb beyond is impaired roller bandages can be used on elbows and knees to support soft tissue injuries such as strains or sprains to ensure that there is effective support flex the joint slightly then apply the bandage in figureeight turns rather than the standard spiraling turns p work from the inside to the outside of the upper surface of the joint extend the bandaging far enough on either side of the joint to exert an even pressure « caution roller bandages a elastic bandage may be applied to hold dressings in place on a hand or to support a wrist in soft tissue injuries a support bandage should extend well beyond the injury site to provide pressure over the entire injured area hand bandages what to do repeat the sequence of figureeight turns extend

wrist pass the bandage diagonally across the back of the hand to the nail of the little finger and across the front of the casualty’s fingers place the tail of the bandage on the inner side of the wrist by the base of the thumb make two straight turns around the wrist  techniques and equipment tubular gauze bandages these bandages are rolls of seamless tubular fabric the tubular gauze bandage is used with a special applicator which is supplied with the bandage it is suitable for holding dressings in place on a finger or toe but not to control bleeding cut a piece of tubular gauze about twoandahalf times the length of the injured finger push the whole length of the tubular gauze onto the applicator then gently slide the applicator over the casualty’s finger while still holding the gauze at the base of the finger gently push the applicator back over the finger to apply a second layer of gauze once the gauze has been applied remove the applicator from the finger holding the end of the gauze on the finger pull the applicator slightly beyond the fingertip to leave a gauze layer on the finger twist the applicator twice to seal the bandage over the end of the finger secure the gauze at the base of the finger with adhesive tape check the circulation to the finger immediately p and then again every ten minutes ask the casualty if the finger feels cold or tingly if it does remove the gauze and reapply it more loosely  do not encircle the finger completely with tape because this may impair circulation applying a tubular gauze caution tubular gauze bandages triangular bandages this type of bandage may be supplied in a sterile pack as part of a first aid kit you can also make one by cutting or folding a square yard of sturdy fabric diagonally in half the bandage can be used in the following three ways  folded as a broadfold bandage or narrowfold bandage right to immobilize and support a limb or to secure a splint or bulky dressing  opened to form a sling or to hold a hand foot or scalp dressing in place  from a sterile pack folded into a pad and used as a sterile dressing keep triangular bandages in their packs so that they remain sterile until you need them alternatively fold them as shown right so that they are ready for use as a pad or bandage or can be shaken open storing a triangular bandage making a broadfold bandage making a narrowfold bandage open out a triangular bandage and lay it flat on a clean surface fold the bandage in half horizontally so that the point of the triangle touches the center of the base start by folding the triangle into a narrowfold bandage above bring the two ends of the bandage into the center fold a triangular bandage to make a broadfold bandage above continue folding the ends into the center until the bandage is a convenient size for storing keep the bandage in a dry place fold the bandage in half again in the same direction so that the first folded edge touches the base the bandage should now form a broad strip fold the bandage horizontally in half again it should form a long narrow thick strip of material  point end open triangular bandage base triangular bandages techniques and equipment square knots hand and foot cover when securing a triangular bandage always use a square knot it is secure and will not slip it is easy to untie and it lies flat so it is more comfortable for the casualty avoid tying the knot around or directly over the injury since this may cause discomfort pass the left end of the bandage dark over and under the right end light lift both ends of the bandage above the rest of the material lay the bandage flat place the casualty’s hand on the bandage fingers toward the point fold the point over the hand pass the end in your right hand dark over and under the left end light cross the ends over the hand and pass around the wrist in opposite directions tie the ends in a square knot above pull the ends to tighten the knot then tuck them under the bandage pull the point gently to tighten the bandage fold the point up over the knot and tuck it in  tying and untying a square knot untying a square knot pull one end and one piece of bandage from the same side of the knot firmly so that the piece of bandage straightens hold the knot and pull the straightened end through it an open triangular bandage can be used to hold a dressing in place on a hand or foot but it will not provide enough pressure to control bleeding the method for covering a hand right can also be used for a foot with the bandage ends tied at the ankle square knots hand and foot cover arm sling arm sling what to do ensure that the injured arm is supported with the hand slightly higher than the elbow fold the base of the bandage under to form a hem place the bandage with the base parallel to the casualty’s body and level with his little fingernail slide the upper end under the injured arm and pull it around the neck to the opposite shoulder tie a square knot opposite on the injured side at the hollow above the casualty’s collarbone tuck both free ends of the bandage under the knot to pad it adjust the sling so that the front edge supports the hand—it should extend to the top of the casualty’s little finger fold the lower end of the bandage up over the forearm and bring it to meet the upper end at the shoulder hold the point of the bandage beyond the elbow and twist it until the fabric fits the elbow snugly then tuck it in or knot it alternatively if you have a safety pin fold the fabric and fasten it to the front bind the finished sling to the body with another triangular bandage or swathe as soon as you have finished check the circulation in the fingers p recheck every ten minutes if necessary loosen and reapply the bandages and sling an arm sling holds the forearm in a slightly raised or horizontal position it provides support for an injured upper arm wrist or forearm on a casualty whose elbow can be bent or to immobilize the arm for a rib fracture p an elevation sling p is used to keep the forearm and hand raised in a higher position techniques and equipment elevation sling this form of sling supports the forearm and hand in a raised position with the fingertips touching the casualty’s shoulder in this way an elevation sling helps control bleeding from wounds in the forearm or hand to minimize swelling an elevation sling is also used to support the arm in the case of an injured hand what to do ask the casualty to support his injured arm across his chest with the fingers resting on the opposite shoulder bring the lower end of the bandage up diagonally across his back to meet the other end at his shoulder place the bandage over his body with one end over the shoulder on the uninjured side hold the point just beyond his elbow tie the ends in a square knot p at the hollow above the casualty’s collarbone tuck ends under the knot to pad it ask the casualty to let go of his injured arm while you tuck the base of the bandage under his hand forearm and elbow twist the point until the bandage fits closely around the casualty’s elbow tuck the point in just above his elbow to secure it if you have a safety pin fold the fabric over the elbow and fasten the point at the corner check the circulation in the thumb every ten minutes p; loosen and reapply if necessary  elevation sling improvised slings improvised slings if you suspect that the forearm is broken use a cloth sling or a jacket corner to provide support do not use any other improvised sling it will not provide enough support if you need to support a casualty’s injured arm but do not have a triangular bandage available you can make a sling by using a square yard just under one square meter of any strong cloth p you can also improvise by using an item of the casualty’s clothing below check circulation after applying support p and recheck every ten minutes jacket corner undo the casualty’s jacket fold the lower edge on the injured side up over his arm secure the corner of the hem to the jacket breast with a large safety pin tuck and pin the excess material closely around the elbow buttonup jacket undo one button of a jacket or coat or waistcoat place the hand of the injured arm inside the garment at the gap formed by the unfastened button advise the casualty to rest his wrist on the button just beneath the gap belt or thin garment use a belt a tie a pair of suspenders or panty hose to make a “collarandcuff” support fasten the item to form a loop place it over the casualty’s head then twist it once to form a smaller loop at the front place the casualty’s hand into the loop longsleeved shirt lay the injured arm across the casualty’s chest pin the cuff of the sleeve to the breast of the shirt to improvise an elevation sling opposite pin the sleeve at the casualty’s opposite shoulder to keep her arm raised caution this chapter is designed as a userfriendly quickreference guide to first aid treatment for casualties with

burn is on the face do not cover it keep cooling with water until help arrives  if the burn is caused by contact with chemicals wear protective gloves and irrigate for at least minutes  watch the casualty for signs of smoke inhalation such as difficulty breathing caution caution emergency first aid seizures in adults seizures in children try to ease the casualty’s fall talk to him calmly and reassuringly clear away any potentially dangerous objects to prevent injury to the casualty ask bystanders to keep clear make a note of when the seizure began clear away any nearby objects and surround the child with soft padding such as pillows or rolled towels so that even violent movement will not result in injury if possible cushion the casualty’s head with soft material until the seizure ceases place padding to protect him from objects that cannot be moved loosen any tight clothing around the casualty’s neck if the seizures are febrile take off bedding and clothing such as a undershirt or pajama top; you may have to wait until the seizure stops to do this ensure a good supply of cool air but do not let the child become too cold protect casualty protect child from injury protect head and loosen tight clothing help the child cool down seizures often follow a pattern  sudden loss of consciousness often with a cry  rigidity and arching of the back  breathing may become

emergency first aid swallowed poisons hypoglycemia reassure the casualty if she is conscious ask her what she has swallowed look for clues such as poisonous leaves or berries or containers or pill bottles help the casualty sit down give him a sugary drink call the poison control center or for emergency help and tell the dispatcher what she took how much and when this helps doctors give the casualty the correct treatment if the casualty responds to the drink give him more sugar in the form of sugar packets or sweet food if he has glucose gel help him take it help him find his glucose testing kit so that he can check his glucose levels identify the poison give casualty sugar call for emergency help give some sugary food  a history of ingestionexposure to poison; evidence of poison nearby depending on what the casualty has taken there may be  vomit that may be bloodstained  diarrhea  cramping abdominal pains  pain or burning sensation  impaired consciousness there may be  a history of diabetes—the casualty may recognize the onset of a hypoglycemic low blood sugar attack  weakness faintness or hunger  confusion and irrational behavior  sweating with cold clammy skin  palpitations and muscle tremors  a deteriorating level of response  a medical alert tag or bracelet glucose gel medication or insulin syringepen in his possession recognition recognition monitor and

where injuries or illnesses occur in many cases the first person on the scene is a volunteer who wants to help rather than someone who is medically trained however in certain circumstances the provision of first aid and first aid responsibilities is defined by statutes in the us these regulations apply to incidents occurring in the workplace and to mass gatherings first aid at work the health and safety first aid regulations of place a general duty on employers to make first aid provision for employees in case of injury or illness in the workplace the practical aspects of this statutory duty for employers and for selfemployed persons are set out in the approved code of practice which is revised periodically to ensure that the appropriate standards are maintained regular occupational first aiders should make sure they are familiar with the code of practice and guidance notes the current code of practice stresses the aims of the first aid provision and encourages all employers to assess their organization’s ability to meet those aims the number of first aiders required in a specific workplace is dependent on the risk assessment which should be carried out by the compliance safety and health officer in the workplace there is a checklist opposite to assist in determining the number and type of first aid personnel required in a workplace the approved code of practice also contains guidance on first aid materials equipment and facilities comprehensive advice regarding first aid in the workplace can also be found at wwwoshagov accident book an employer has the overall responsibility for an accident book but it is the responsibility of the first aider or appointed person to look after the book if an employee is involved in an incident in the workplace the following details should be recorded in the accident book  date time and place of incident  name and job of the injured or ill person  details of the injuryillness and what first aid was given  what happened to the person immediately afterward for example went home or was taken to the hospital  name and signature of the first aider or person dealing with the incident reporting of injuries diseases and dangerous occurrences in the event of injury or ill health at work an employer has a legal obligation to report the incident the occupational safety and health act under the “recordkeeping rule” and the revised recordkeeping rules of requires an employer to report the following  deaths  major injuries  injuries lasting more than three days— where an employee or selfemployed person is unable to perform his normal work duties  injuries to members of the public or people not at work when they are taken from the scene of an accident to the hospital  some workrelated diseases  some dangerous occurrences such as a near miss where something happens that could have resulted in an injury first aid regulations factors to consider impact on first aid provision is your workplace low risk for example stores and offices? is your workplace higher risk for example such as food processing or dangerous machinery? do your work activities involve special hazards such as hydrofluoric acid or confined spaces? how many people are employed on site? are there inexperienced workers on site or employees with disabilities or special health problems? what is your record of accidents and ill health? what injuries and illness have occurred and where? do you have employees who travel a lot work remotely or work alone? do any of your employees work shifts or overtime? are the premises spread out; for example are there several buildings on the site or multifloor buildings? is your workplace remote from emergency medical services? do any of your employees work at sites occupied by other employers? do you have sufficient provision to cover absences of first aiders or appointed persons? do members of the public visit your premises? the minimum provision is  an appointed person to take charge of first aid arrangements  a suitably stocked first aid box you should consider  providing first aiders  additional training for first aiders to deal with injuries resulting from special hazards  additional first aid equipment  precise siting of first aid equipment  providing a first aid room  informing the emergency services where there are small numbers of employees the minimum provision is  an appointed person to take charge of first aid arrangements  a suitably stocked first aid box because there is still the possibility of an accident or sudden illness you should consider providing a qualified first aider where there are large numbers of employees consider providing  first aiders  additional first aid equipment  a first aid room you should consider  additional training for first aiders  additional first aid equipment  local siting of firstaid equipment your first aid provision should cover any workexperience trainees make sure your first aid provision caters for the type of injury and illness that might occur in your workplace monitor accidents and ill health and review your first aid provision as appropriate you should consider  personal first aid kits  personal communicators to remote workers  cell phones to lone workers make sure there is adequate first aid provision at all times while people are at work you should consider  first aid provision in each building or on each floor you should consider  special arrangements with the emergency services  informing the emergency services of your location make arrangements with other site occupiers to ensure adequate provision of first aid a written agreement between employers is strongly recommended you should consider what cover is needed for  annual leave and other planned absences  unplanned and exceptional absences under the regulations you have no legal obligation to provide first aid for nonemployees but the site contractors should be included them in your first aid provision this is particularly relevant in workplaces that provide a service; eg schools places of entertainment fairgrounds stores checklist for assessment of first
